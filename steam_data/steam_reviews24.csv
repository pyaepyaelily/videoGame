2017-07-30,0,0,194,True,Recommended,I have 95 games in my inventory and have played video games since the 70s. 12 years on Steam alone. This game stands apart from many other games I've played in the excitement and incremental stress (good kind) that comes from a well developed concept and exciting gameplay. I gave a ton of my time to DayZ in hopes that it would produce this kind of outcome. I love the open world and personal tactical choice for style of play. The Devs are really on to something with this game. For those who enjoy either open world or shooters this has something to offer for both. Im a fan so far. 2 thumbs up.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-01-07,0,0,656,False,Recommended,I really did and still do enjoy this game and its concept as well as gameplay however just like EVERYONE else playing it is extremely frustrating running into (most commonly chinese) hackers. When you take the time to play correctly moving circle to circle aqcuiring kills and gear only to have LingLing253 or XiongFeng 858 stand on top of a hill somewhere and do a short birst in several directions from the hip and score a half dozen kills and ruining the fun the legit players are having then you need to take a good look at your game. Reporting them seemingly does nothing as its getting more and more common there needs to be some feedback on the tickets weve opened against these cheating players or maybe just a chinese only server where players like this can behave this way against like minded players that want to cheat against one another. These players are laughing at the rules youve put in place and the legitimate players need to know something is being done.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-03-10,0,0,377,False,Not Recommended,The swaying testicles on these morons are astounding. This game is now officially broken thanks to the latest patch. Their PR bimbo suggests closing other programs to help the game run better! PUBG_Hawkinz (Community Coordinator/Developer/Knob Polisher) has said We will not be removing our recent patch in order to keep blocking cheats effectively. This latest patch has caused numerous issues with players. What specifically affects me is the banning of VMWare. I run VMware because I paid for it to run virtual machines so I don t have to dual boot or run another computer. Many tens or hundreds of thousands of people that are IT professionals or just hobbyists run VMWare and I bet many of them attempt to play this game as well. Apparently this company is now dictating what legitimate software you are able to run on your computer while playing this game. I am not shutting down my programs to play this game. I have the resources to run everything. So what is next? Are they going to demand you install Battleye on your router and every PC on your home network? This game was promising 6 months ago but has turned to absolute rubbish and I do not expect a turn around.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

It's riddled with hackers (not a huge amount that I've seen in EU servers but I know of others) bugs and the optimisation of this game is complete garbage. If you can avoid it don't buy it for 27 go look for it on GMG or something like that.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-08,0,0,300,True,Recommended,It's a difficult one. You have a game thats simple to it's core and yet so much fun! But it is hugely un optimized and the lag desync etc is unreal plus it's always fun to blast someone close range with a shotty and it not register ). If they fix these core performance issues this game will last a long time if they don't it's for sure not worth 28 pounds. Wait and see what happens before purchase. P.S I have heard a lot about cheaters but only experienced the odd one or two. People tend to slap a cheat tag onto anyone for a good shot.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I put most of my time in playing it with other friends which makes the game fun to play. I don't enjoy this single person personally. The reason I dislike the game is that you have to use your own resources to catch hackers/cheaters. People in game the land on the ground instantly spawn with a fully loaded gun and equipment to where you are supposed to loot for gear. This makes this extremely unfair to players that play legitametly.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Speeds up the game everyone willl have fun. Its a simple solution. This will also prevent people from being stuck in the damned blue zone for the most part. I know alot of the times im like it ill stay my butt in the blue zone for a bit because i need better loot or whats the point in even running. Chances arent good withn you have a shotgun and a pistol. or a m16 and no sights. lol P.S optimize the ing game too! lol If this can happen ill change my review.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-04-23,0,0,97,True,Recommended,I own a couple of games that offer similar experices to this one being H1Z1 King of the Kill'On the face of it the games sound the same. You parachute onto the map land get gear and destroy the opposition. You have to collect weapons armour meds and more just to ensure you make it to the end. BOTH games offer this style of play. But make NO mistake the games are worlds apart. H1 Z1 feels much more like a lower end copy (even though PUBG was released after) PUBG offers a better experiece in my opinion mainly as you can have varous scopes grips and gear that H1 Z1 lacks. PUBG also feels more polished and well produced. It's still in the early days yet but the game itself is a lot of fun. I'd advise playing with friends if you can as random groups can be a pain. Lots of John Rambos thinking they can hop and dodge bullets. Crazy.The price difference between H1 Z1 and PUBG is pretty steep. But comparing the two side by side you'll see why! Defo pick this up when you can play with mates and give Stonemountain64 a watch. It's amazing. Solo play is also fun and you really do get scared when you hear opponants around. Absolute blast and the recent update just makes it better.H1 Z1 4/10PUBG 7.5/10 and climing as things get better.The PUBG Sales figures speak volumes. Buy it.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-01-10,0,0,120,False,Recommended,I loved this game when i first got it just a couple months ago. But for some reason it has completely gone to not that the game itself is bad but simply unplayable without restarting the whole game a dozen times until it will actaully load you in AND allow you to do anything.Even the menu has trouble loading now and I am amazed that this counts as an improvement to the game. I have searched for reasons for my trouble and have only found earlier complaints. I would still like to continue playing but i would suggest that they hand the game off to someone who knows what theyre doing or simply do their jobs and make it playable again.Keep in mind that i have brought all settings to their lowest and have even sacrificed my resolution with no improvements whatsoever.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-01-07,0,0,393,False,Not Recommended,TOO MUCH HACKS!! For the last three days almost every game my team was in have got hackers taking out 70% of the people before the second circle. The hacking is so obvious that they are doing it like there is no tomorrow.Imagine you carefully pick out a location parachute and loot with your buddies for 10 minutes fully loaded and head into the circle only to have the whole team insta headshotted from 800m away by a wall hack + No recoil AKM + aimbot. Imagine having that experience every game for three days straight.And yes I do do my parts and report the player whenever I can.

2018-01-03,0,0,174,False,Not Recommended,The game is filled with Aim Bots and wall hackers. The servers are so you're always lagging. The parachute system sucks.

2017-11-26,0,0,744,False,Not Recommended,I loved this game for quite a while and it was my absolute favorite game nothing even came close.But I will be quitting as the game is currently a fraction of what it used to be and the devs appear to have no idea what they're doing in any department.Almost every game has multiple cheaters that can shoot you from across the map through terrain on full auto while not even looking at their screen. Their aimbot will force them to hit you even if they aren't paying attention.The devs don't seem to give a damn about that probably because they get money from letting the people cheat and then banning them later instead of preventing them from cheating in the first place.This game also has the worst desync and lag I've ever seen. I am playing this game with 30 ping to the NA servers and I can honestly say that it feels like a disadvantage to have good ping. Players with high ping can walk around a corner and shoot you 5 times before they even walk around the corner from your perspective.I belive that once another game like this comes out with devs that actually have a clue what they're doing this game will die quickly. It's as if the devs hit the lottery and then spent it all on fireworks until they had nothing left. The game had huge success and they're it all away.I currently rate this game a 1/10 if you have friends to play with and a 0/10 if you don't.S T A Y A W A Y from this game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-10-28,0,0,485,True,Not Recommended,This game is addictive and fun to play. The randomness keeps you on your toes and forces you to think about what you are doing. There are so many different stratagies that you can apply and there is just the right amount of urgency to keep things moving along at a good pace. I like that there is enough versatility in the map to allow for different kinds of gameplay all the way to the last circle. I like the amount of weapons attachments vechiles there is a lot in terms of gameplay to like. If this review was based just on gameplay I would say to any friend YES get this game. HOWEVER. Early access sure. But there are things wrong with this game that make it hard to play on what I would term a 'normal' gamers system and therefore making the early access useless. If you have high end CPU and GPU you still have to play with most of the settings on low to get an acceptable amount of FPS. I would say I have a mid range system needs some updates but servicable and most games I play are on upper graphics... I have serious crashing issues with this game. If I don't exit the game each time I finish a match I get a memory error the next match. My game has been crashing 50% of the time with no indication of what might be cauing the issue (since last patch). And the last patch didn't even pretend to address any memory issues but focused on applying small changes to gameplay and gameplay bugs. If the memory and graphics issue was not enough In the last week of playing I have encountered at least one hacker a day. In fact I just ended a game where I was in top 7 until I got insta head shot thorugh the wall of my house. It is getting more and more common and very frustrating. No matter what server you play on. At this time even though I enjoy the game a lot I cannot recommend that anyone buys this game unless they KNOW that thier system can run it without a doubt. After that I would tell them to be cautious because the updates are not promising there is not enough communication from the devs and the game is growing too fast which leads to rampant cheaters. It is too much money to wager on an early access game that might not work for you.Hopefully that changes until then it is a no.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

But don't you dare kill a streamer or you will get banned. Don't you dare beep your car horn and not realise you are by a streamer. you will be banned. blatently cheat? thats fine. I have video proof of cheaters. i have videos of me point blank shooting people with shotguns to the head and upper body. multiple times then they just spin around in half a second and kill me in one shot.

Even I have to raise my eyebrow and question how thats possible. But nonetheless playing the game all makes sense its something that can have you going for hours the intense final zone gun fights playing with a squad and corridinating attacks or even as simple as looting a house and finding a level 3 vest. There arent many games that take the same ""genre"" as Pubg there arent many battle royal shooter as successful as pubg. Sure you have Arma and maybe some other ones but those games are too hardcore for casual audience. But this this game is a mixture of hardcore and easy going something both pro players like Shroud can enjoy and something a new newbie starting out can also enjoy. To conclude if you dont have this game in your steam library then you dont have complete game collection this game is worth the however much it costs (even if it cost 60$ i'd get it and for me thats pricy) and it'll get you doing hours on end.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-19,0,0,193,False,Recommended,So this game is kind of in the middle for me between liking and hating it. On one hand I think that this is the superior Battle Royale game to Fortnite because there's less cheaters and it just feels more fleshed out. Fortnite was never really meant to be a Battle Royale game anyways they just jumped on the cash cow when they saw the PUBG success. And on the other hand this game has had a LOT of players from China whom hack frequently and never really seem to be dealt with accordingly. I don't know I would watch gameplay of this game and think if you might get into this genre. I can't say i'm too fond of it but I see why people like it.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-03-27,0,0,164,True,Recommended,To start off this game is far from perfect. It is really badly optimised and has problems with lag spikes and generaly low fps even on the lowest settings however the devs have stated that they are prioritising the optimisation of the game which i'm glad about. I have on multiple ocassions experienced crashes in the game and massive server lag which was not on my end because other people in my group were also experiencing the same thing. However flaws aside the gameplay is some of the most intense and fun that i've experienced in a long while the guns have a satisfying feel from the recoil and sound combat feels solid and almost arma like minus the janky movement xD. I've been playing this game for over 9 hours and I can tell you that I barely sleep anymore the amount of times you will be telling yourself that you'lle only play one more will amaze you 4 hours will pass you like a breeze. Overall as long as you have a decent PC and are looking for one of the or if not the best battle royale game out there then I definitely recommend buying this game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-16,0,0,314,True,Not Recommended,An epic game when it doesn't crash. Heart pounding action from start to finish. Great idea for an early access game but that's its downfall for now It's still early access. Cheaters exist in plenty at the moment Loads of glitches some are hilarious but my biggest gripe is the unbelievable amount of times the game just randomly crashes. Sitting in the lobby for 5 minutes. Game crashes... Swimming whilst passing through the play area wall Game Crashes.... walk backwards out an open front building whilst looking down scope... Game Crashes.... Basically once the crashing issue has been addressed i will happily give it 10/10UPDATE So the game crashes have dropped to a minimal but the scripting/hacking is rife no matter what the devs say Bound to have at least 1 issue every 5 games be it from guys who magically headshot everyone they see (even on the run) to those who blatently just take a full magazine and laugh at you over direct (then beg for you not to report them when you mention you are recording everything)To be honest it's kinda losing it's appeal somewhat.

2017-04-29,1,1,533,True,Recommended,This game looks highly promising main issues currently are HARDWARE OPTIMISASTION and HITBOXES im getting 40 60 fps on a GTX1070 &amp 6600K rig but only 8GB RAM (may be the problem) with small drops here and there in cities.Pros EXCELLENT &amp REALISTIC gun play ABSOLUTLEY BLOOD PUMPING there's barely any rest and you can get killed unexpectedly. Always assume someone sees you and plan acordingly. SOUND is really nice gunshots and steps vary according to the gun you have and footwear respectivly. SUPPRESSORS are NOT so OP and are very balanced. Gun Costumization is really nice realistic as well. ADDICTING! Especially with a Team or a Duo. Only 1 MAP which is a good thing it's 8Kmx8Km (HUGE) not randomly generated but loot spawns is random so it Doesn't get boring at all. Graphics are nice 7/10 ish. Gets updated almost Daily Devs are very caring and constantly working on Improvments. Potential is THROUGH THE ROOF just give it time it'll be #1 on ratings and sales. No gun is really OP everything's balanced here. though shotguns will make you a winner in early game CQB.Cons Framerate is really bad as of now better OPTIMISATION is the solution and it'll get better for sure with time. UE4 is known to have some problems with non AAA games that don't have lots of devs working on it. (though playing on low medium settings give you some kind of an advantage when in tall grass and far distances. HITBOXES are kinda as of now. but it's no thing that can't be fixed. Bugs are present but not so critical it happended once to me when the buildings and any artificial monuments just Don't render and i could see loot through everything. a restart solved it though. Short range gunfights feel a bit odd and wierd for some reason i can't point my finger at it exactly though.*my experience Laying prone with a 4x scope on an SKS looking down a tall hill gave me deja vu from the original OP.Flashpoint times for some reason. made me have a big smile on my face although i was getting pinned and scared . Situational Awareness Planning Ahead Cooperation Callouts Effective use of Cover and keeping CALM are key! use the Compass as frequently as posible! Holographics sight and Red Dot feel differently at different ranges and i find the HOLO sight's reticle to be better for me but the sight's body obstructs my vision a bit so i'd rather play safe and use the Red Dot when i can. Prefer A Shotgun+AR instead of 2 ARs! also pistols can be life savers! Frying pans can litteraly save your even if you dont use them! prefer a UAZ car instead of a buggy. Don't try your luck in the RED (Bombing) zones find a house and stay in the first floor. don't take items that you don't need! for Ex. don't take 9mm or .45ACP if you have an M16 and a Kar98K and no pistol. So to conclude i REALLY liked the game and i'm really looking forward for better performance. can't wait to see more features in the future!THANKS FOR READING! D,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The game itself is awesome so i guess its just the buisness side of PUBG that is well behind the times. You can't make something sell it and then decide to limit or restrict when people can play it. Make a product and do whatever it takes to stand behind. It is what it is but you will oftem log on to play and then end up playing somthing else.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-12-24,0,0,92,False,Recommended,*!! Recomnded for now will probably change in about 6 months Other battle royale games are improving This game died when it try to re sue fortntie and other games because they think they own the genre of battle royale No good improvements other than a few new weapon changes and some sound/optimization changes. I presumme this game will be near death in around 6 months or less !!*Should you play fortnite or pubg probably fortnite or just get this on mobile if you can as it is free. The devs have done not a lot with this game in months its mostly the same game at launch just some loot changes and 1 new map and another new one to come out soon.Also with pubg trying to sue fortnite not the best idea it seems childish.As a battle royale game the reason this game works so well compraed to other games is that you are always finding loot and being pushed to the center of the circle. Always being forced to move and the random loot and a lot of different loot makes it interesting and fun. Being only pvp with no pve also helps.Amazing Game can be boring depend on how you play i advise not to camp (staying in the same spot) and also looking for loot makes it easier for late game with better equipment. You find random loot in random places after jumping out of the plane. You move to the designated circle and if you do not decide to move quickly even way before the circle gets near it can creep up on you.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-13,0,0,61,True,Not Recommended,Somehow the most popular game right now full of bugs and clunky ness that are probably not going to be fixed in lieu of new content.It is decently fun in 3rd person mode although it promotes gameplay that I personally don't enjoy (peeking around corners/ over walls is a dumb mechanic imo). The gunplay is nothing too great but is serviceable this ties in with first person mode being clunky and badly made to the point of frustration.The graphics are quite nice on maximum settings if your pc can run it through the non existant optimization (focus on features rather than fixing). I haven't noticed any issues with render distance and hiding in the grass which is a huge plus.The community is toxic although with the game being number 1 on steam you are bound to get toxic people by the thousands. While I've never played H1Z1 I wouldn't know if the game is actually any good as the reviews have been tanked by people fanboying over PUBG (as an example of toxicity).When they fix bugs and glitches and add basic features such as vaulting (overdue for some 6 months now) I will definitely try the game out again but until then it will be another EA game on the shelf of crappy EA games.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-01-08,0,0,2052,False,Not Recommended,"This game used to be a lot of fun. Unfortunately the developers have not been able to keep up with the explosive growth. The game just recently reached the 1.0 milestone and yet the experience is far worse than it was just six months ago.The game lacks the tools necessary to communicate effectively with your team. The vast majority of games on the North America servers are filled with players who do not speak English. This is not a problem in games like League of Legends where you can communicate intent to a degree without spoken voice. In PUBG not being able to communicate with your team is a significant disadvantage. There are many locales that need to deal with this challenge. Europe has many languages and communication barriers are a reality of life. Still the experience today is far more negative than it used to be due to the game's deficiencies in the area of non verbal communication. Differerent types of map markers and pre canned localized voice audio like Counter Strike would go a long way towards fixing this problem.The game servers are also really laggy and inconsistent. I've been complaining about this degradation for several months but I always wondered if I was just making excuses for losing. It turns out that the performance gap is measurable and worse than other games in the same class. PUBG servers provide an inconsistent and negative play experience. Anecdotally laggy players seem to receive a benefit. This is not unprecedented in online shooters but the frustration of being killed by ""lag bullets"" is magnified after spending 30 minutes running across a giant map.This frustration is even more pronounced when killed by a cheater and let me tell you there are a lot of them. Now that there's a killcam you can watch and see every fishy kill in every game. Players can shoot through mountains and score headshots at huge distances they can move at incredibly fast speeds and they can heal instantly. With so many cheaters this game is a complete waste of time. Several times during every play session I'll make my way into the final ten or so only to see the rest of the server be quickly killed by a rapid succession of headshots. If you played The Division you'll recognize the problem instantly.At the end of the day this game just isn't fun any more. I leave the majority of games wishing I hadn't played at all. This review is really my outlet for the frustration the problems of scale have caused. I know these issues are being worked on but it stings to invest heavily in a game in early access and then see it ruined. Take my words with a grain of salt. There's definitely an unhealthy amount of ""I liked the game before it was cool "" happening. Still I've tried to accurately represent the reasons why I would not suggest that new players buy PUBG as it exists today.I used to walk away from this game with great stories and new friends on Steam. That hasn't happened in a long time. Until the developers address these issues my recommendation is to save your money and play something else.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2018-01-11,0,0,50,False,Not Recommended,Although i can understand the initial appeal of this game you vs the world in large open environments it ultimately falls flat. First of all the game is buggy and unfinished with borderline unresponsive hitbox registration and wonky environmental interactions like vaulting and doors not opening/ getting in the way of looting. Second the game itself is boring and repetitive. If you land at an outskirts location you can look forward to finding crap loot running for ten minutes to escape the blue zone followed by getting shot from 600 m away by a hidden sniper. Alternatively you can parachute into a popular hot zone find a shotgun kill the guy who ran into the building with you only to get shot in the back by the third guy in the building. Despite all of this i did have fun playing this game. The problem is for every minute of fun gameplay there is 30 min of boring downtime involving waiting for a game and running to get in the zone/find a car. My BIGGEST gripe with this game however is the fact that there is simply no way to practice. There's no shooting range or practice mode where you can test and develop a crucial understanding of the quirks for the multitude of weapons gear and attachments. Shooting enemies at a distance for example requires a detailed understanding of the bullet drop for the specific gun you are using how much to lead the target if they re moving and depending on the gun you are using how many shots to what body parts will take out what level of armor the target has and so on. As a result the only real way practice the game is to drop into a hot zone with many other players and fight it out. Unfortunately taking reps like this for a beginner means they will likely only get one or two kills before dying. A chance at a couple kills every 8 min is a snails pace for practicing.Many players have fully developed understanding of this game and how to play it well. Players that have hundreds and hundreds of hours playing the game. Players that are often in the game with you shooting at you. This game is fun if you git gud but to do so takes a significant amount of time MUCH more than other fps multiplayer games. Ultimately you should try PUBG out if you have some friends to play with otherwise I would save your $$ for something more fun.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

It is not. Many players are either not used to a Military Sim shooter or rely 100% on the 'deathcam' footage as proof that someone cheated (fun fact kill cams have never been accurate since CoD did them). The whole 'this person killed me so they must be cheating' mentality is attrocious in this day and age. I don't care how long you've been playing shooters you're not immortal. The time to kill in this game is fairly quick and at least 90% of your deaths are going to be your own fault. Bad positioning bad use of mechanics bad map and surrounding awareness bad shooting poor decision making. This is NOT a Call of Duty shooter stop treating it like one this game requires a good deal of tactics and understanding to secure wins often.And news flash there's 100 people a game you aren't going to have a 50% winrate. Even the top players don't have 25% winrates. Accept death and grow up with this stupid 'everyone is a cheater' mentality.Actual Review Pros Military Sim Massive Maps Endless Replayabiity due to varied circles loot and encounters Solid mechanical gunplay Good game for friends of 2 4 Custom game options Future Full Mod Support and Steam Workshop Stable game experience solid 60+ FPS with High/Ultra settings on even GTX 970 Organic game tension and funny moments High Skill/Medium Luck Easy to pick up Supports Controllers No Planned Paid Maps/Weapons/P2W mechanics only Cosmetic Boxes (which you can earn for free) Large Number of Weapons Vehicles and Items More Maps Vehicles and Weapons planned Constant game balancing Replay/Demo SystemCons Toxic Community (Unavoidable in this day and age but the complainers about supposed cheater plagues are the worse) Microtransactions (Cosmetic only if that bugs you) Only Two Maps currently with 3 Game Modes each having 2 variations (1st/3rd Person) Occasional Server Stability Issues (They do happen but are not unplayable start of game may be laggy until 20ish players die off) Running Sim (You'll spend a lot of time on foot if you don't enjoy that aspect in a game) Cheaters (They're not non existant but they're supremely rare personally never seen one once while playing or watching others play) Toxicity (Seriously Overwatch/LoL/Dota look tame by comparison.

The worst part is the recent plague of hackers/cheaters recently. It seems every other game I encounter people who have hacked the game so that my hitbox is such that they land every bullet without their reticle being anywhere near myself/my squad. More than once I have encountered players whose shots pierce obstacles with no line of sight for head shots.I don't write reviews...but this is ridiculous.

2017-06-28,0,0,38,True,Recommended,ATTENTION! UNBIASED REVIEW INCOMING!!!! alright so you wanna buy the game but you are not sure because of some of the negative comments on here. thats fair you should be careful when buying games as a lot of them seem really cool but end up being 3D trashcans.I do not have a ton of playtime on this game however I would watch my friend play for some time and I have watched tons of videos on this game. tons. PROS AND CONS LIST TIME. D PROS great visuals for an early access title it looks fantastic. the map is really large for what this game is and offers a lot in terms of places to go lots of different types of weapons attachments gear clothing etc. controls feel great almost identical to any other FPS on the PC very high replay value to this game once you finish in the top 10 you wanna keep playing until you win. for 30$ its current price at the time of this review I consider a good fair price.CONS few visual bugs here and there mostly affecting terrain and buildings nothing game breaking. lack of character cusomization kind of dents the fun in that department. yeah you can unlock a random box to give you gear HOWEVER it gives you ONE piece of clothing and the price for one box is unusually high and it increases in price by double everytime you buy one. it really discourages you from caring about wanting to customize your player. And thats... about it. its really a fun game and in my opinion it feels more like a finished title rather than early access. dont pay much attention to the negative reviews when it comes to this game they more than likely cant break the top 60. ) I have not had any problems with people camping once or any other problems that others describe. 8/10 great game for the price of 30$. you will have a lot of fun I can promise you that.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Alone or with friends or with complete random people that most of the time make the game fun even if you end up losing. But no more. And its because of all these asian players. They are a plague that need to be exterminated. Refusing to even attempt to communicate in another language and killing their own teamates. When they group they never use anything else but the in game app to talk so even after they die they just keep talking yelling in chinese making it imposible to concertrate or have fun. And also how once 1 of them die they just disconnect leavbing you to play 1v4 or 1v2 if you were lucky enough to not get a 3 man team. I have never written a review before but i cant take it anymore. I have played 250h of this game and i enjoyed most of it but am done. Eu or Us server it doesnt matter anymore. 6/10 games end up being with asians that dont even try to speak english.

2017-04-28,0,0,173,True,Recommended,The best take on the battle royal format. It has the smoothest engine and controls compared to the other two. On the downside it's not very optomized. Most players have to play with everything on low to get a decent framerate. I have a GTX 1070 and I can only play medium with about 50 FPS. Another glaring issue is the FoV with is defaulted to 40. You can't see anything in firstperson pretty much and there's no way to change this without using third party scripts. Thankfully the developers announced and FoV slider and optimization patches that are to come out soon. Overall the game is worth the $30 price tag and it's my favorite game of this year.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-07-03,0,0,12,True,Recommended,This is one of those games that boils down to a share your adventures with your friends simulator. You know the kind of water cooler talk people used to do with things like Skyrim because experiences can vary so wildly. Unfortunately there s a lot less to talk about when it comes to PUBG. That doesn t make it bad but it does seem like a one trick pony after a while.A large portion of my gaming community has already been playing this for a couple months and it never seemed quite like my style of game. I got the gist and even watched a few Let s Plays of it. It s essentially Hunger Games (Or Battle Royale if you re everyone else who has seen that movie which I have not). You can queue solo duo or with a squad up to four. With a hundred other people you re put on a plane that flies over a pseudo Slavic landmass (with town names like Po i and Lipovka ) and must choose where you drop in. The map is massive and littered with explorable buildings each with completely randomized loot. You can either get lucky and start off with scoped sniper rifles or unlucky and have to move through an open field with nothing but pistols and motorcycle helmets.Every couple of minutes there s a specific zone that every player must reach or a blue tech wall comes down and drains your health. It s a more boring version of the forest fire or poison gas from the Hunger Games movies just being a mechanic to get people moving and running into each other. Without it these games would be days long with people hiding in bathrooms.There s a sort of meta with a large portion of players choosing to hit up the military base and there s a more than average presence in the school due to there being a ton of rooms to explore and thus a good chance at decent loot to carry onward. After that stage of the game the Early Access rears its head. The experiences can vary wildly but there s not a whole hell of a lot to the game itself. There s not much left for me to talk about besides a few of the encounters I ve had. Water cooler talk engaged!It s not a game I typically play alone and three squad games in I managed to make it to 20 people left alive before dieing. During this game one of our idiot mates beached a boat on a tiny spot of land beneath the military base (Where the zone was closing in). We had to swim for several minutes while the number of players went down at a consistent rate. We killed a few people on the beach before I finally got sniped and a teammate carried us and pulled out a bonafide victory netting me four hundred ingame coins which only serve to give you clothing that you can start with. I m still holding out for that trenchcoat. In one idiot move that guy might have actually saved us from several gunfights that might have killed us otherwise because we spent half the game under water.During another squad game I didn t have much to my name except for a shotgun. We were under attack from another team downing one of my mates and circling my house. One of them opened the door and I unloaded downing and then killing them instantly. While I reloaded in a panic the other turned the corner and I did the same thing to them netting a double kill.In another I had the SKS sniper rifle which is a decent piece of equipment according to multiple sources. Unfortunately we had landed in the same area as another team. While my mates were taking cover I managed to down two and kill another in what was basically shotgun range netting me a triple kill.In a duo queue I was exploring a building without much luck before reaching the roof and got an instant shotgun to the face being one of the first ten to die. I knew someone else was around but didn t realize that they landed on the damn roof directly and just got lucky with a weapon. I was too busy laughing to be angry.After a while I decided to brave the solo queue and fared far better than expected making it to #18 and earning an above average payout for how long I lasted.That s part of the game really. Luck. The variance in experience seems to be what keeps people going despite the simple mechanics. It s certainly one of those games where I thought Why hasn t this been made already? Maybe it had but never quite captured the magic of PUBG. It s really not my style of game (I m not fond of pure PvP unless there s AI enemies involved) but once I figured out that this game could basically be compared to a roguelike it got better. It s a multiplayer roguelike the idea is not to win every time... But to see how far you can get.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

It s intimidating to say the least every match starting and ending in embaressment at least until it doesn t and you Winner Winner Chicken Dinner . I haven t gotten there yet. My PubG experience has been one of narrow visioned paranoia from what I can only guess is feuled by the amphetamine drip of someone waiting around the next corner for you. You have to move quickly with certainty and force to break through to your next ramshackled house filled with loot or the already looted. It s a game that deserves to be played or attempted.

2017-03-26,0,0,426,True,Recommended,Pros It's essentially Arma 3 Battle Royale without the clunkiness of the engine. Thus game feel a lot more fluid. Some may say it's very much like H1Z1 I think that this one is superior. Even though it is in Early Access the game feels very polished. Weapons and overall gunplay feel great. Few current concerns (That I'm sure will be addressed in future updates) At the moment the game needs some optimization which I am sure we will see in the future. Small fps dips here and there but nothing that essentially breaks the game. Servers do lag at times. Again this will be fixed in time. Overall for me it is a buy. If one had a choice between this and the other Battleroyale games this would be one to look into over others.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I run a 1060 3 gb and a i7 7000 and get between 100 144+ fps on competetiv settings. As of 30 06 2018I have maybe encountered obvious 2 cheaters in more then 800+ hours (with test) I only play FPP on EU. There is way less cheater in the game that some sheep here are telling in their ""review""Ingame cosmetic items does not ruin a game if they do not give you any advantage. A lot of the complaints around cosmetic items comes down to the lack of understanding about how to run a company. A valid criticism is that they should not release more skins into the game when there are obvious problems with the game. It gives a lot of players a bad taste as they feel PUBG are focusing on the wrong things. Especially when they release one patch to add skins and then later another patch to fix bugs etc. Do not be discouraged by all the people complaining. The game has given me hundreds of hours of entertainment but also some hours of disappointment but I feel the game is worth the cash $. BUT I strongly recommend playing the game with friends solo can be really hard for a new players and solo is generally the most frustrating game mode.

The map is infested with them it may take weeks to clear them out.Day 2 I'm an unknown threat to them a predator in the shadows.Day 7 30% of the infestation has been wiped the bulk of them being simple minded and practically unable to walk let alone aim.Day 10 They have begun repopulating. their numbers grow just as fast as I can kill them. I must enlist help on this crusade to rid this infestation. Day 11 I have enlisted the help of a small group of hired guns to assist in purging them off this island.Day 14 The numbers begins to tip in my favour. However thgoogle translateey have begun mimicing me and my group. I lay awake at night restless they are learning. Day 18 They have managed to surround a few of my men today. They surrounded them and began chantting as they all ran at them at once. The survivers were found huddled around each other. They had all gone insane as if they had seen a monster. they kept whispering ""China number one"". Day 22 I only have a few men left. Most were swarmed others deserted. The population of the filth is all but unknown now I fear I won't be able to stop them.Day 31 A new threat has emerged from the depths of the hive. They're apex predators their aim is unparalleled their instincts heightened. Capable of seeing a target hundreds of meters away and through several walls. My men have started calling them ""Bing Bongs.""Day 35 The Bing Bongs are relentless they have slaughtered many of my men. I witnessed them slaughter their own kind without a second thought.Day 37 The number of Bing Bongs is skyrocketing I have had to call in some help. BattleEye Has launched a large strike on a few of the Bing Bongs central hive's but will it be enough to hold them back? only time will tell. Day 38 I have encountered a few Bing Bongs since the BattleEye strike however they are weakened. Their aim has being completetly impaired they just lean slightly and shoot at nothing. Perhaps they were somehow being augmented in the hives? Further reasearch must be done. Day 41 Another Bing Bong has been spotted today. I stood in awe as It ran faster than my men in a UAZ ( Ulyanovsky Avtomobilny Zavod ). He must have been running atleast 50m/s. my men they did not make it. Day 42 I encountered another enhanced Bing Bong. It moved so fast I was bearly able to keep track of It. It was unarmed but It would blink behind me then punch then run all the while It was taunting me laughing at me. As I land the killing blow It screams ""CHINA NUMBER ONE!"" I will not be able to sleep tonight. Day 44 I have been unable to sleep for three days due to the ominous threat of the Bing Bongs is to much. BattleEye Plans to attack the hives again tonight maybe I will be able to rest for a few hours. Day 45 No sign of the Enhanced Bing Bongs I remain vigilant.Day 46 I encountered a Bing Bong. The BattleEye strike must have worked It is unable to aim but It remains aware of my postition. A well placed nade kills It. Day 47 One of my men managed to record inside one of the hives. It appears they willingly accept a parasite that enhances their abillities beyond their biological limits. The BattleEye Strike only seems to kill the infected hosts and the surviving parasites morph and adapt to resist the BattleEye strikes. My hands haven't stopped shaking since I watched the recording. Day 54 The Infestation has spread they managed to get aboard a plane sent to resupply me and my men. Hives have begun sprouting up in Miramar the local goverment was fast acting and built a wall to enclose the area. All surviving civilians have been evacuated. Day 55 My men and I have left Erangel to deal with the threat in Miramar. The Bing Bongs here are different. Civilians saying that they witnessed a single Bing Bong kill as much as 30 people through walls buildings and hills. If this is true me and my men are walking into a slaughter. Day 58 The stories are true nowhere is safe. A plane with 92 men on it was flying into Miramar to provided aid for the Cleanse. The moment it was above the Hives all 92 men died they weren't even able to jump out of the plane. Thats when I saw it this filthy Bing Bong Feasting on a succulent chicken dinner amidst the mass grave of dead men. Day 59 BattleEye launches Its first strike on Miramar. Everyone is praying the strike works. Day 60 The strike worked but the Bing Bongs parasite is so volatile It has already adapted. Day 61 Following the recent strike many men have abandond the fight to cleanse Miramar and Erangle and moved to fortnite. I refuse to give up someone must remain to cleanse. Day 64 BattleEye has begun launching small strikes in rapid succession atempting to adapt as fast as the Bing Bong Parasite does. Day 68 The Rapid adaption is working small waves of Bing Bongs are being cleansed each time. This might be enough to ralley some men back to the Cleanse.Day 71 The number of Bing Bongs is decreasing however their lesser weakened forms still infest both Erangle and miramar. They seem to be operating as small guerilla groups hiding in the darkness ready to pounce on my men whilst they loot for supplies. We will have to be more cautious to avoid further casualties.Day 75 Me and my men have been tasked with cleansing Erangle as Miramars infestation population remains on the decline. Day 82 It appears that only 9% of the original infestation remains.The chanting of ""China Number One"" can be heard faintly at night.Day 95 Its been two weeks without a single Enhanced Bing Bong sighting. I have planned to take a large portion of the men I have to Sanhok the Bing Bong homeland. hopefully we will be able to wipe them out. Day 96 The island of Sanhok apears to be a training ground for the Bing Bongs we will be doing further research and reconnaissance onto what else they use the island for tomorrow.Day 97 Todays reconnaissance has provided alot of information as to what else this island is used for. They have large areas dedicated to growing farming and processing rice. This must be how they feed such a large population so effectively. Salt farms were also discovered along many of the islands coastlines. With a supply this large I can understand how they remain so volitile and aggressive all the time. Day 98 Great strides have been made in eradicating the indigenous population of Bing Bongs. I think my job is nearly done here. Day 99 Recently an Uknown corporation has been selling my men a pass. Its a list of diffrent things they want done on the island cleanse 100 Bing Bongs nade a few burn a couple et cetera et cetera. But after completing a few task they are rewarded with some Gucci clothes. Day 100 small pockets of the weakened Bing Bongs still inhabit Erangle and miramar. I continue to Purge and Cleanse as much as I can but due to the low numbers of weak Bing Bongs I find myself often waiting hours before encountering enough of them to retreat and resupply.After 100 Days of Cleansing I have accumulated enough chicken dinners to feed a large camp of vegans for a lifetime. 5/7 game would play 100 more days.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Unlike my old favorite FPS CS GO PUBG is easy to jump into right away and with far more fun and far less stress (no teenagers screaming about their rank!).The game is tense like nothing I've played before. You can spend a half hour gathering weapons and supplies only to turn a corner and be blased in the face with a shotgun and its all over. One of the scariest moments has to be when you're alone in a house and hear a car pulling up outside. Few games make my heart race like this one.PUBG is poorly optimized and buggy but I expect that to be fixed over time. It's a fantastic experience and a bargain at $30.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

If you get ruined by a cheater/hacker then its easy to jump straight in to another round.

Most of the time you will die by someone camping in a bush stairwell behind a tree house or just being prone in the grass but most people would argue this is playing the game ""strategically"". I would say that it is a lazy and unforgivible playstyle for those who use it making me hate this game even more because 9/10 times you encounter people is through walking into them camping or them shooting you in the back. I dont recomend this game to people who dont want to waste their time a luck based loot and non skillful gameplay as it does not award a player with using thier aim to their advantage but rewards campers to use a silecened gun the has no penalties to the shooter or his gun and shoot people from 5 meters away without being heard.Yes I do like this game but it frustrates me alot with how many people that take advantage of the third person camera to peek around walls and with them being totally unseen also the people that camp in all spots which for me ruins the game as a whole. hopefully with the new desert map update they make a much more open and easily viewable environment so it makes camping alot more difficult and brings skill based shooting from long distances into play.I do though recommend this game to people playing in groups as that is the most fun I have had in my whole entire play time throughout this game. )",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I could give the lootbox rant but they have only done that once... so far. But the two pressing issues with the game are terrible servers/netcode (Don't know exactly which and I'm not going to put more effort into debugging than the devs) and hacking. The former problem is never truly gone but it has its good nights where the main annoyance is a small amount of lag on opening/closing doors and it's bad nights where you won't be able to get through a door for 5 10 seconds. My personal experience on the issue is just to flip a coin on whether you'll be able to play half of the time you'll be SOL. The latter problem is the real one that breaks it for me and turns it into a vehicle to screw with friends without really adding a good experience. There are plenty of videos on the internet that show you some of the they pull so I'll get to the issue the devs aren't fixing it and are choosing to focus on upcoming updates like the desert map. Don't get me wrong devs adding more to their game is a great thing and still needs to be done in this game's case due to the one map issue just with different instagram filters on it but the game is going to be just as frustrating to play when you know that more than likely at least one of the 90 odd people has some sort of cheat going. It makes every death a question of ""Was that guy using cheats?"" when it should be ""What can I do better?"". The devs have come out saying that they're banning a lot of people in short time spans but it doesn't seem to have helped with the end user experience. I would recommend holding on to the money or finding something else until they've patched the game enough to not make it a hair pulling experience.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I am currently unable to play the game because it crashes on startup. I have tried every solution and none have yeilded result. The game is a looting simulator where you will spend 90% of your time running from house to house to find loot while the circle slowly closes in. Combat is rarely a display of skill and more a showing of who won RNGsus favor in the previous 20 min of looting. On top of it all the game has hackers and cheaters almost every few games. The Bugs frame drops lack of replayability lag and a host of other issues has many players questioning if this level of deveopment is a low point in gaming or if it is the new norm. I hope it is the former. Save your money and play fortnite for free its a better game overall.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

So to fix that I had to close out the program and reopen it when the username I chose was taken. (Before I even got to play the game I found a bug)2) My second or third game playing I was on a motorcycle and it would not let me get off of it. I recieved an error code something like ""You can not exit vehicle"". So there went a good 15 minute game wasted. I had to close the program and start a new game.3) When I select ""Start"" to begin a game it will freeze ""Starting Match""4) After I die It does not let me watch my death cam because the server is ""too busy"". Apparently the server has been too busy for two day straight. (Yes I have death cam enabled). I beleive this game has the potential to be great but considering it has been out for over a year now and has more bugs than most betas that I've played... PUBG will not reach its full potential.

Instead of fixing the game's issue they decided to make customization to milk money out of the game.I think they should fix the problems of the game before continuing their marketing scheme.

It's timing and luck and planning out your moves in advance while maintaining 360 awareness. That being said there is terrible netcode issues at times. Usually when the North America server is overrun with Cheating Chinese players and their ping abuse/wall hack/aimbot/recoil hack/ etcetera goes unrestricted. Basically avoid NA server middle of the day in NA and you're generally alright. There is also the small issue of their loot distribution algorithm sometimes being a little...off... example... drop from plane.. loot 5 buildings find multiple back packs gun attachments random ammo rare level 3 armor/helmet.. no ing weapons gets killed by a naked guy with a shot gun. / or vice versa... find 15 really awesome weapons no backpack to carry ammo and no attachments. / still a good game overall.

2017-07-27,0,0,295,False,Recommended,(July 27 2017) Great game but severe optimization issues that simply aren't acceptible even in early access. I expect the engine to at least be alpha before early access starts... Killing Floor 2 did this and it should be the standard. I'm running a 1080 ti and i7 6700k with a custom loop which included dual 240mm radiators and I see temperatures approaching 100C on Ultra. ALL OTHER GAMES PERFORM AT TEMPERATURES UNDER 50C. This is a huge problem. The game runs just above 50C at medium settings which is still ridiculous. Because the game looks like something out of 2008. I also have difficulty understanding why a frame cap of 60fps is not the default Or why there is not an option to cap framerate at your monitor refresh rate. I should not have to go into the settings file to manually set this myself. All this said this game is very enjoyable. I'd be happy with 10 maps at release and perhaps double the current number of weapons and vehicles. Accuracy on full auto is a bit ridiculous this should be patched and made more realistic. I will update this review once I am satisfied that the developers have optimized the game sufficiently.Update (Nov 27 2017) Update Optimization has improved. I can now run PUBG on Ultra and maintain 60C in my water loop but the level of detail with respect for the demand on my system is still disproportional. That said the concept of this game at the time of early access release was unique. And it is wicked fun. I've bought several copies of this game for friends and we frequently find outself gaming for 4 5 hrs straight on days off/weekends. Highly recommend PUBG assuming it keeps its $30 price tag. Any higher and it would need more content although the second map is on the way.Would like to see a night mode would be a lot of fun. And looking forward to the vaulting system. Teammates killed in a vehicle should not fall out. And passengers in vehicles should be able to heal while driving.Update 2 (Dec 20 2017) New map is very well done. Graphics look good. Hardware wise my system is running much cooler albeit in Canadian winter so ambient is lower. Pretty happy with the release. Vaulting is included. Good but not great. I'd like to be able to cat grab walls over my head and pull myself up. but it's a step in the right direction. You're now able to heal in a vehicles as a passenger so it would seem that the developers are listening. With that in mind I feel I can now recommend this game and will continue to support it so long as continual content is released. 2 maps is a start and appreciating how large they are 10 is a bit much to ask but I would like maybe 2 or 3 more before we start seeing DLCs assuming we come to that.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The lag the BM from joining a team as a solo and having Chinese players of whom kill you for not speaking their language. This has only happened a handful of times though it doesn't excuse the developers for making the Asian players join the NA servers. I'm not entirely sure if this has been fixed since I haven't touched the game since it's release. Also players have no reason to trust the developers anymore. ""We won't release microtransactions until the game is a finished product "" And then proceeds to release microtransactions.

This game really needs a LOT of work for it to even be enjoyable. The latency the optimization and over gameplay is pure and utter garbage. The only thing this game has going for it is the gunplay. But even that has some drawbacks you can put your crosshair on a guys chest dead center at 100m away and you completely miss. AND don't even get me started on the ing cheating and hacking. If this game is going to die It WILL BE by hacking and cheating. You play each match fully expecting and rather confidently knowing there is at least 1 hacker among the lobby. Its ing cancer. Enough ranting on to the pros and cons.Pros&gt Gunplay (Most times)&gt Replayability&gt Killing Helpless PeopleCons&gt Latency (Dying behind cover from the guy thats shooting at you)&gt Circle (Like holy they didn't need to buff it and go 100 km/h at some points)&gt Optimization (Even with a good rig when I start shooting my computer takes a by the time it comes back Im dead)&gt Community (Toxic as . Just listen to the pre game lobby. &gt Teamwork (You better play with friends or your gunna get 3 dip or a ton of Asians)&gt Audio (Most times you can't even hear footsteps or vehicles approaching unless they're coming right at you)&gt Poor UI (Restarting lobbies teammates stuck on spawn island but turns out they're in game and appear as enemies errors and busy servers)&gt HACKING AND CHEATINGThe biggest complaint is of course the cheating. 5 games in a row inside the top 10 and you get sprayed full auto by AKM with no recoil while the guy is sprinting to your left but somehow still able to land EVERY single shot. Glad they put Killcams in because its so easy to spot people cheating and report them but yet everyone still ing hacks. And they are usually 100% Asian you can tell by the name and them killing 20 of the remaining 30 players in quick succession. I'm talking like 30 seconds to a minute. And during the middle of the game you can get killed by a full auto SCAR from 400m away 3 straight shots to your head instantly die. You watch the death cam and he has no recoil and just snaps to your head with their aimbot. LIke I said before If this game is going to die it WILL BE by hacking and cheating. And the devs say they have banned a lot of people but that won't change the outcome. They will buy the game on another account and do the same over and over again. Way to go BattlEye way to go.This game is for 30 bucks I do not recommend. And stay away if you don't wanna lose you ing sanity. Wait till the devs fix this t and optimize the game properly.

The Amount of chinese Hackers in this game is ridiculous really wish the devs would IP ban them and do a better job of keeping them either off our servers or off the game I'd say a good third of Chinese players are hacking/glitching and the rest are basically loud and obnoxious (you know that thing people complain about Americans being.)1. Despite the LARGE amount of moronic babble in the lobby (which you can just mute) it's fun.2.the weapon selection is good and nothing minus the 7.62 revolver feels worthless most weapons have a purpose and fill that role quite well.3. lots of strategic gameplay and factors that play into winning a match (Sadly luck is one of them)4. it's a fun experience with friendsthe bad the way the Team is handling Microtransactions on a game that IS STILL IN ALPHA ON TOP OF BEING PRICED $30.absolutely repugnant much like my problem with ARK this is a crappy move and earns instant repudiation. it's a scummy practice by anyone regardless of how much money the game has made. which sitting at $30 for a game that isnt finished is already asking for a lot. now with 2.50 crate and keys? O F F. maybe at .99 costume pieces AFTER launch sure....maybe.... but in alpha? No way. will not recommend until this is sorted out. cant. as for technnical problems? the game lags sometimes the system for moving over cover is garbage small fences and such causing your character to stop mid jump is and not to mention the gun interaction with windows is (Scope will have clear line of sight out of a rock/window and the shots will hit the window frame/rock without some sort of audio cue that your barrel is bumping into a solid object or fixing the gun height) not to mention the vehicle physics (Getting knocked out in a car teleports you out of a car? kinda dumb.) overall Minor problems you will overcome...for the moment though i will not recommend it simply because of the actions of the team behind it.I am Resicnding the Negative review and giving it a Positive now that the Loot box thing has been passed and is no longer a part of the game new guns a new map vault mechanics everything people ask for has been added to the game relatively quick and for the most part in working order. Good work.Edit and.....we're back to Negative so after living through a Loot Box scandal selling billions of copies Expanding into the Chinese Market and being the top selling Battle Royal game these s decide to add loot boxes into a $30 game? really? has PUBG not made enough money as is? absolutely despicable.

Nearing November less updates all BlueHole wanted was new guns maps and cosmetics. Every month or so they released an Anti Cheat update that they try and remove most of the hackers... That isn't good enough. Go back to weekly updates and work on Anti Cheat so I didn't pay $30 and waste 450 hours of my life to just die to hackers half the time. I just wish that BlueHole would just fix the cheating problem. I now know why Fortnite is the more popular choice of battle royale...,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-03-04,0,0,37,False,Not Recommended,Pubg is an enjoyable and fun game in the battle royal genre so much so that the litany of bug and technical issues can be forgiven however there are two things that can t be the developers refusal to region lock the servers and the sea of cheaters plaguing the servers. As an avid gamer I have played competitively online in all genres of games on multiple platforms but never in my life have I encountered so much blatant cheating. The games developer Blue Hole supposedly takes cheating very seriously but the bans they have handed out have not even made a dent in the cheating base. The replay system serves to help weed out the cheaters as well as make it abundantly clear just how many cheaters you run into which is a lot. The other less pressing issue is the region lock. I ask a very simple question what is the point of a region server if you aren t confined to it? Why when 99% of the cheaters are from Asia (fact not racism https //steamed.kotaku.com/99 percent of battlegrounds cheats are from china play 1821513424) then why would they allow those cheaters to corrupt the other servers? The simple answer china is there biggest market and they don t want to upset players at the expense of all the rest of us. In reality PUBG is a great game with poor technical execution and developers who can t seem to prioritize what s important.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

There are plenty of weapons and the hitboxes work well. Generally the feel is better and comes across as a little more polished.That being said there are gameplay issues. The game can be laggy and experiences a lot of FPS drops. It can be a little bit clunky too. This is not Battlefield when it comes to smoothness of operation.

It has a fair combat system loot is never a problem to find and sniper battles in the forest are super cool. The combat zoning makes for quicker matches and makes a deterant for campers and forces us to meet up and fight at one point. I can't wait to see what this game has to offer in the futureAnyone who likes ARMA or dayZ would enjoy this game alot.

2017-06-04,3,1,354,True,Recommended,So....I went traveling with my friend once he is a baker I am a zoologist. We were skydiving to this cool tourist island but ladned at the old communist base.We jumped off next to the western bridge found an AK and a pistol. I had a lot of gun experience so I took the rifle.After fliping our newly discovered car we climbed on top of the bridge which lead us to not finding a single person in the vicinity.We carried on through the field where we saw a crate falling from the sky. Inside there was a m249 which I gave to my friend. We moved on just to find a motorbike (which we fell off of like 5 times breaking my friend's toe.) Later we camped in the forest trying to find some food or shelter but we had to leave due to the large blue forcefield pushing us forward. After getting shot couple of times we found ourselves crawling across the forest with low ammo no meds no proper guns and a lot of pain. That was the moment my friend got shot and started to bleed. I killed the assailants which got us a ticket of the island.Oh yeah I heard the game is good I have yet to try it.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

You WILL have the most insane adrenaline rush of your life in some games with a ton of different strategies and approaches to keep it interesting as well as action packed. There's everything at risk when you're in the top 10 and it makes the chicken din din that much more tasty.

2017-08-01,0,0,349,True,Recommended,Got this game because I saw half of my friends list playing it and figured it must be worth jumping into. This is only the 2nd EA game that I have purchased so I'm not to fond of spending money on unfinished products. I've had it for 2 months now and the updates come each month with huge changes that actually make the game feel like it's moving smoothly towards be completed at some point.The game itself does have it's fair share of bugs but it feels like the developer knows of the major bugs and tries to squash those as quick as possible and then work out the minor ones along the way. They release major updates every month and minor weekly updates that usually address new bugs and minor improvements to systems.Gameplay wise this game is great. I've only played Arma 3 King of the Hill and Wasteland modes so I don't have a ton of playtime invested in Battle Royal games. Every match is fun whether you win or are the first one to die. When you finally get into that last 10 your heart will start racing as you try to not up getting that chicken dinner.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-30,0,0,86,False,Not Recommended,"PubG a brilliant game executed perfectly. When it wants. This game has brilliant combat and is amazing to play with friends but that is only when it works. This game is riddled with bugs glitches and exploits that tons of players (including me) have experienced. They rushed the new map to meet deadlines and took the game out of early access just so they would keep a promise. The community that has been created around this game is the only thing keep it alive. The bugs and glitches effect all types of computer set ups. Buildings not loading in Happens to me every single game I would have to wait atleast two to three minutes in game for the buildings to load. While this happened I was killed late to looting etc.Game not loading This does not just effect my medium set up I do not have a crappy PC nor do I have a god PC but when all the teamates click ""ready"" my game is not. I am stuck in the loading screen while everyone runs around for three minutes and I am still loading once everyone has pulled their parachute.Low polly glitch If your lucky enough to have the building shapes load in the doorways and floors just seem not to want to work that game. For the rest of the game or a large amount they will not work and you will die waiting to start.Getting all the reoccuring game glitches out of the way lets move onto the combat issues.Houses A partial amount of windows in the game have bars the developers might as well not have put a window there. In battle a player cannot shoot past these tiny bars. ""But they are bars no crap they cant shoot through them its realism"". Well in every house if you are crouching you cannot aim out the windows you are just too short and you will end up shooting the wood.Cars Cars are a frustrating part of the game twenty to thirty minutes of combat and looting just to die to a kid in a car driving from the zone. Now I know that getting hit from a car will kill you in any other game it is just even if you counter said car. The player is dead and the car still rams you. Guns Pistols are underwhelming rifles are good for a select few shotguns are overpowered submachine guns are crap.Throwables Stuns are useless grenades never throw correctly and smokes dont have the same effect for other players depending on their graphics. When you smoke a hallway and you think your clear to dash away the enemy can mostlikely see you.I want to give this game a positive review I really do. All the glitches exploits and bugs ruin this for me. Im frustrated with the game. They should have stayed in early access. I regret my purchase I know I have seventy one hours on the game but I was putting up with these reoccuring problems. I have seen no fixes for the past months and they have not addresses these problems. I would NOT reccomend this game to people looking to spend their money on a polished game. If you are indeed looking to spend your money on a game that is not yet done has a toxic community bugs glitches and frustration go ahead.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-05-01,0,0,116,False,Recommended,Honost Review Game Mechanics Overall this game feels nice to play but there is some lag components if you have a much worse computer than others. Smoothness The Game can be choppy at times for example on my computer when I throw a flashbang and it lands in the building and I look away my game lags to hell. Other than that is is fun and it is easy to get kills.Player Base Overall if you do not play computer games with your freinds this will not be fun after a while. Pubg is a much funner game with freinds. Even though there is a duo mode most of the people in duos dont have mics and or they are Asian and dont speak english. So have freinds to play pubg with. One other thing I do want to point out HACKERS This game is infested with them like the black plague. Almost every single PUBG match I have played there has been a hacker wheather they are doing the weird car hack aimbot speed hacks someone always has to ruin the game. But the bright side is that Blue Hole has been doing their best to get rid of these hackers in enormous ammounts a day!!! Thank You Soo Much Blue Hole!Overall Buy this game when and if it goes on sale some people say its too expensive for what its worth and I agree. If the price was lowered down to lets say $19.99 $15.99 it would make sales quick but $29.99 is a bit expensive I think Blue Hole. Runs choppy at times but beefy computers have no problems and the graphics are phonomonal!

PC version id be lucky to get a couple shots in and and do maybe a few points of damage that is if i can actually find someone in the short amount of time given before i have to run to the safe area. your either lucky or not at the start. you mind find a good weapon in the firsdt building you check out or like the most a handgun or nothing.Mobile version the map is generaly the same however it feels smaller so you can actually get to different areas swifter and come accross actual players. loading times are a lot quicker. the item spread is more rewarding you are more likely to actually find a gun and ammo as aposed to the pc version. granted the controles are finiky but it makes up for it by auto equiping items so you dont have to open the menu every time you think you found something useful and equiping it to your gun.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I liked H1Z1 (when it was good) and I even like Fortnite after playing it for a bit but PUBG just didn't get me. The specular lighting is completely exaggerated and the graphics overall rather hurt my eyes than look nice (and this is coming from a person that doesn't really care about good graphics.)Coming from csgo i literally have zero ""feeling of control"" in the game. Everything is like it's in slow motion. This is kind of hard to explain but people who play csgo will know that you can run strafe around bunnyhop etc. With pubg i can't even control my character while parachuting down the way i want to now this for example is not a problem with fortnite at all.FPS Just trash. Not much to say. My rig isn't the best with a GTX 970 MSI and an i7 6700k but it's also not that bad. Even when optimizing graphic settings putting things on low etc. my fps are still bad and the game looks even worse. Skillgap Well it's not really high. Again not to advertise or praise Fortnite but the building aspect gets the game to another level. Simply landing in buildings playing looting and running simulator isn't my understanding of fun. Did that enough in H1Z1.Overall this game is/was overhyped and it's honestly i can't even come up with a single positive thing about it.

2017-12-06,0,0,282,True,Not Recommended,This game is really fun to play but it looks like it will remain early access forever. The game has serious issues and bugs but the developers prefer to create a new map and add some new weapons instead of fixing the current map and the client. As you understand the game was working fine on me till a 23MB update. I tried many things but the game still crashes on launch. So I believe that this is a joke to sell a broken early access game for 30 bucks. They will just try to get as much money the can I don't think that they really care to publish a full retailed without bugs game. Have fun.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Hit boxes are also a large problem where bullets will just fly through someone because the game decided not to register that headshot costing your your first win.

Jump on 1 of the 2 map grab a gun/rifle/shotgun and try to make some kills. Be the first to see and you'll be sure to kill first.

2017-11-12,1,1,479,False,Not Recommended,Overrated. Laggy. Chaotic. Infuriating. TrashThis is what happens when the wrong people come up with a good game concept.Player unkown should go back to making arma mods and Bluehole should just stick to making mobile games. Props for trying. But this is just cancer.The only thing that can make this game borderline bearable is playing squads with friends. There is absolutely no room for competetive edge or improvement when network lag and low frame rates irrespective of the hardware and graphic settings are literally considered a normal part of the gameplay that most of the community has just accepted and gotten used to at this point. Crashes on an hourly basis (usually its just the game simply dying completely out of the blue but sometimes the game just freezes on screen not even allowing opening the task manager and requiring a full system restart to fix this would be bad for some niche indie game but for something this big and popular its just completely unacceptable) Network lag (Things like Opening doors Reloading weapons Shooting Picking up items etc. etc. LITERALLY ALWAYS FEEL LAGGY The most infuriating part is the amount of lag seems as though it is calculated precisely to make it just infuriating enough to make the players complain but not quit even though complete temperory disconnections are still inevitable) Rubberbanding physics (trying to jump on to something is just a hit or miss nightmare and no while vaulting is useful it is not the solution/replacement to broken jumping mechanics its just too slow when you press 'W' and 'space' together from a stand still you should jump forward not up its not that difficult to figure out and don't even get me started on vehicles) Blasphemous hit registry (getting killed AFTER getting behind cover from the direction of oncoming fire is another one of those 'So normal its basically a feature' things) Other Glitches (including but not limited to falling though the map vehicles getting stuck inside walls and exploding even on slow impacts hitting 'nothing' and flipping while driving up/downhill etc.) Hackers (There's too many of them and most of the time you wont even know you have encountered one and just feel bad for not being good enough) Irrespective of what server you join half of it will ALWAYS be filled with Screaming Chinese people using microwaves for microphonesNobody asked for a new map.

2018-03-10,0,0,864,False,Not Recommended,"Review after 425 hours! This game has great potential but right now it's dying and it's because of the developers greed. The gameplay in the actual game itself is good but the optimization is terrible. There are still bugs heavy fps drops lag &amp desynch while playing even if you have a great pc. Major problem is the developers just keep adding more ways to get more money from you but they are not fixing the problems that have existed for months. They do not listen to the community at all. People were upset that the game only sparingly gives you a lootbox that you can open free of charge while 75% of the time giving you one which requires a key which you must pay for. Instead of fixing extreme low droprates they decide to implement a version of their own "" Battle Pass "" which acts as a progression system. The problem is that you have to pay another 10$ or euro to be able to grind for the unlocks. And you will have to grind a lot. The pass is only for 30 days and while very similar to free to play titles that also use a system like this it still costs more money to be able to unlock any of the items. MAJOR PROBLEM IS THE GAME IS JUST NOT OPTIMIZED AND THE DEVS SPEND MORE TIME ON INVENTING WAYS TO GET MORE $$$ FROM YOU THAN FIXING THE GAME. So no not reccomended at all.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

It's been months since the launch of 1.0 and rather than busting their to iron out the issues in the game Bluehole has decided to just start adding loads of cosmetics that require you buy keys in order to aquire. No need to address the fact that I can shoot somebody 10 feet in front of me but because ""Haha desync"" I died 10 seconds ago. No need to address hackers who snap to your head before you even know what happened. It's a ing shame because underneath this unpolished turd is a game that could be amazing if the dev would just fix what everyone in the playerbase is complaining about. I get that fixes take time but when you are consistently releasing new content and not addressing the other massive issues with your game there's something wrong.

2017-07-02,0,0,399,True,Recommended,So PUBG is a battle royale game that throws you out of a plane on to an island along with 99 other players. You have some choice on where to land in the large play area and then you proceed to loot abandoned cities and the like. You can play solo in a duo or squad (four players) there's guns there's vehicles many shirts and a few hats. The game motivates/forces players to engage by shrinking the playable area as the game goes on untill remaining players are left in a tiny circle. The last player or team standing wins. Let me lay out some pros and consPROS Unique gameplay not many alternatives Every single kill makes you feel like you won the game Well made guns and gunplay feels good if a bit awkward Huge map (more maps to come I hear) Promotes socialization and provides a large variety of teamplay tactics if playing in a group or duo Looting is fun and stays fun at least for a while Sometimes the visuals shine.CONS Many strong tactics can be.. frustrating and cancerous like room camping hiding in bushes for 20 minutes etc. Game feels rough and often awkward janky. Some features to come will address this other parts may stay as they are Demanding on your system. As of now can have inconsistent performance even on good systems. Some inconsistent approaches to realism like you can jump off the 3rd floor of a building to take minimal damage but killing yourself in a vehicle accident is pretty easy sometimes by just jumping out of a (not too fast) moving ride If you queue with random people they might just shoot you or throw the game otherwise so you really want some friends over voice chat to get the cooperative experience.PRO or CON you decide In my experience most engagements are decided by luck if you happen to see your enemy first you have a huge advantage. Same with where the game area shrinks to if you happen to be in it you can just find a strong position and hold. To sum up you can wander the map for 20 minutes not coming across anybody and then get 1shot in the head from an unknown place PUBG has its issues but if it's your type of game it'll grab you and won't let go. There are many things in store for the future as it's early access and the devs say they want to develop it as an online game (meaning with post release free updates). Oh and it might be your type of game without you even knowing I initially very much disliked the idea of it but then gave into friend advice and I'm loving it.Grab some friends and give it a try.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-13,0,0,646,True,Recommended,It currently says mixed how ever i think Bluehole is doing a great job with this game. Having played countless other games and seeing how this game gets a decent to good flow of updates. The game itself is allot of fun that is if you are looking for the thrill of being on the edge of life and death. This game is how ever only for the more advanced shooter players who dare to take risks are aware of their surroundings and know when and when not to shoot a player (don't be trigger hungry!) At this point there is some controversy as ppl like to call it regarding player bans. The funny part about it is 9 out of 10 cases the player could have prevented it from happening. But instead (also top streamers) just say it's not there fault but the games fault. That is like saying... well a bank had there vault doors open so it's not my mistake of taking things out of it but the banks fault so don't arrest me! So i think that it is great that even the partners who promote this game are not immune to punishments I have seen games before where any player doing the smallest thing would get them banned and a streamer who got them customers would get away with it. Bluehole has some flaws here and there but who doesn't? I see Bluehole evolving yes they make mistakes but if they see they were wrong they will correct it. After having so many sales they have hired fresh blood. Which means those that are new will make some mistakes that the more experienced staff would not. Keep it up Bluehole and ignore the army of haters that like to be zombie nized by their favorite streamer who likes to cry after getting banned for being an idiot! ),PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-04-29,0,0,869,False,Not Recommended,This is honestly one of the most pathetic games of all time which is a complete shame since it came 90% close to being one of the BEST ever! This game is very fun and addicting but the absolutly atrocious development makes it basically unplayable. Either the developers are beyond incompetent or the management is pushing them in a way that is ruining the product. Basic glitches and gameplay mechanics issues are completely ignored. Instead they focus on more profitable things like skins and new maps. Chinese hackers make third person ONE HUNDRED PERCENT UNPLAYABLE. Literally every single game. But I guess that makes me xenophobic? /s I keep playing this game in the hopes that it gets better and honestly because I have no other games to take its place. In the meantime after countless hours in this game I feel a strong urge to ask Blueballs How dare you make a game where 50% is the most amazing thing ever and the other 50% is the most garbage ever?

2018-01-09,0,0,377,False,Recommended,"This is one of the most fun multiplayer games to come out in the last few years!It's not for everybody and this game had a pretty rocky road through early access to get it to release. But now with 1.0 out they have delivered on all their promises and you have a fairly complete game with easily hundreds of hours of play without it getting old. Once you survive the early game every pubg game is different (made even more memorable through the replay system where you can watch back how it played out). Most games end up being more about the journey and not the destination as 95% of your games will end with you suddenly getting shot by a guy or squad that you didn't see in time. But for that 5% where you make it to the final few left... Man... There is nothing else like it in gaming right now. I've never played a game that could give me as consistently high an adrenaline rush in the late game like this one. Once you get confident enough to not only survive until the late game and be able to do more than just hide that's where the game really shines. The final moments where you (and your squad mates) are barely even breathing because its so intense right up until the point where you get the final kill is downright cathartic usually in a collective cheer and sigh of relief followed by ""one more game?""If you have gotten good with other shooters be aware that this game does have a pretty big learning curve with both combat game sense and even parachuting tactics towards the beginning of the game. There are not many opportunities to get comfortable with the combat enough to get a handle of each gun's recoil and bullet drop and so it takes a bit of time to get used to each weapon. Also it will be frustrating at first when it always seems like someone finds a gun before you do and ends up shooting you before you get to do anything. Once you get better at parachuting and quick thinking with regard to where to loot that type of game will happen less and less.It's a really intense game in solo but its made even better in duo and squad game modes particularly if you have friends to play with (the in game chat usually features lots of spam which leads most people to use programs like Discord for game chat). The duo and squad games I think have the most replayablility.The only major issues I've had with the game are early game lag and buggy vehicle controls particularly with the bikes which have a tendency to flip and glitch out on the terrain either damaging or killing its drivers most of the time. The red zones are also a bit of a pain in the as a game mechanic but I suppose keeps the game interesting with a little element of randomness. Also I have only ever encountered a few hackers (which are easy to spot through the death cam and replay functions) but then again I play on mostly first person servers and the hackers tend to prefer the third person ones. The UI can also be a little buggy particularly with the menus as it often doesn't always show friends online that should be online making it difficult to get people into the party. The loot boxes in the game are also pretty laughable which each box containing one really dull pair of clothing that you don't want anyways. I've opted to selling them on the steam market rather than opening them and have ended up making up all the money I paid for this game and then some which is really a plus.Overall there is a reason why this is one of the most played games out right now. Once you get past the learning curve its a fun thrilling and endlessly frustrating experience (in an oddly good way) that always makes you keep coming back for more. Battle Royale as a game genre may have existed in some form before this game but this is really the first game that really made it a thing. It's a new fresh experience after a relentless onslaught of rehashed fight die respawn fight die respawn first person shooters like the Battlefield and Call of Duty series which I've honestly gotten bored of. The gameplay in PUBG feels a lot more fleshed out where each game feels like its own small adventure until they inevitably end with you getting unceremoniously shot in the back of the head or finally getting that sweet Winner Winner Chicken Dinner.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-04-03,0,0,149,True,Recommended,Words cannot describe how much I love this game right now I simply cannot get enough of it.Personal ThoughtsThis game caught my eye from a few streams I've watched. The longer you survive the more tense it gets. Just watching the match's total player count drop the zone get smaller and hearing constant gun battles in the distance makes all the more thrilling.I've constantly lost so far mostly straight away because I feel like I can take on the world with my fist! All I can say is do that in the open. Because following a player into a house will always end badly at the end of their gun barrel. But I love learning from it how I can approach everything better and more discretely just try and better myself for next time.I would recommend playing with other people friends hopefully because that alone makes matches more funny. But if you like the solo challenge taking on a server of 100 people coming out on top above all the rest then I highly recommend this adventure for you. You'll laugh cry and scream in rage. But always go back to hitting that 'Play' button on the main menu after a match.Performance GabberThis game is quite the RAM Goblin at the moment I have had a few crashes because it just consumed too much RAM so bear that in mind when setting the quality levels of your game at this point. Fingers crossed this will be improved upon in the future but other than that it runs like a treat. Not much server lag at all during matches I've played which is nice.Sadly at this time 03 Apr 2017 you can lower the foliage settings so there are pretty much no bushes or tall grass to hide in. Which is a shame because I would like to do this more often. Thought I have heard this won't be an option in the future so every one will have the same details as one another. This just means some people will have an advantage over others when in the more open areas and the farm fields.Happy hunting people!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-17,0,0,327,False,Not Recommended,Watched people play this game on youtube and twitch and decided to give it a shot. It is honestly a great game that you can have so much fun with be it with friends or by yourself. The thrill of combat in this game and the constant tension that you feel is just great. And don't let the game being in early access keep you away from playing it. It's a great game and I would 100% recommend it to anyone who is even slightly interested in it.Edit The game has issues that have to be adressed mainly the chinese issue. Bluehole really needs to get their together and give the area with the biggest playerbase better servers. I'm getting really sick of playing and having chinese people in my squad number one it causes extreme lag and number two I can't communicate with them. Communication is key in squads and I don't think I should have to learn mandarin to play a video game. There's also the issue that the vast majority of cheeates are chinese. It's not xenophobia Brendan it's called I want to play with people who don't cause our servers to lag don't speak english and where the majority of cheaters come from. Region locked servers now.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-12-20,0,0,627,True,Recommended,This game definitely is a cruel mistress. The game at times can be laggy buggy and cheaty. In most cases that would send many running for the hills but this game definitely is an exception. The reason people keep coming back for more even though they run the risk of running into these issues is simple The game is fun. Now of course this game shines brightest when you have a merry bunch to play with but solo play is still a decent amount of fun. If you are looking for a game for your group then this is definitely the game for you! Now if you don't have a group to play with this game becomes a little less fun to play and I would recommend playing with some randoms until you find some people you really enjoy playing with. If the battle royal genre doesn't interest you or you have no interest in finding people to play with you that's fine it just means the game is not for you.In conclussion I would say that this game is an absolute ball with friends. A moderate amount of fun without them. Leaving the only drawback is the problems of an unfinished unoptimized game. On the brightside though the devs aren't done with it and it has gotten better since I initially started playing it.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-01-07,0,0,390,False,Not Recommended,This game does a lot of things right. It gives you that intense survival experience where every building is a chance to find that precious loot you're desperately searching for. Every town has a chance to be occupied. Every corner could have the enemy hiding behind it. Every shot you fire could alert the enemy to your presence. I absolutely love this survival feeling and it's what keeps me coming back to try for that sweet chicken dinner. The shooting mechanics are tight and you rarely go an entire game without finding some kind of decent weapon. Despite how much I love dropping in with a squad of friends and fighting for that sweet chicken dinner there is one part of this game that absolutely ruins it for me. Hackers. I cannot count how many times I have been killed and lost games due to someone hacking. In fact this review is a direct result of being killed by a hacker who was not only aimbotting but was shooting and killing everyone in town from inside a hall way. Being killed by a hacker completely ruins the mood and my friends and I often stop playing for the night after such an encounter. I recommend sticking to first person mode as it seems less littered by hackers. In fact I'd say stay completely away from third person until Bluehole does SOMETHING to combat the immense amount of hackers polluting and ruining the game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

However the creator is a complete dullard and wants to follow suit. Not any one of the mechanics of the game are actually original yet the creator claims he created a genre. The creator claims that anyone who thinks China has a disproportionally large number of hackers is actually a racist. That's right! YOU ARE RACIST for thinking a name like 'xuazingzi501923123' is a Chinese name and that 'xuazingzi501923123' speaks Chinese after he 'aimbot no recoil wall hacks you down'.

2017-05-19,0,0,133,True,Recommended,Really fun &amp super addicting. Unlike most I have thankfully had no major issues regarding performance nor cheaters (so far) but seeing how many people are actually complaining about these things it certainly needs to be put into consideration before buying. Other than that the shooting in the game is generally really fun and feels realistic and theres also a good variety of weapons and there are a lot of attachments that you can find for them as well. Graphics are OK but there is however a blatant lack of color and textures generally look really bland and boring. It's not the worst I've seen though but something I feel could be improved in several ways. Matchmaking is really fast and you find a game within seconds. You should expect a lot of campers especially in solo play but since the entire game is based around strategy (not RNG... *cough cough*) camping becomes a natural part of the games' basic strategies and isn't something at all I feel troubled by (since I do it myself lol). As of right now the game has properly balanced gameplay and there is thankfully no gun that feels overpowered or that is necessarily alot better than most. Winning in this game is the greatest feeling in the world and honestly not a feeling a lot of games can make you achieve.Overall really fun and a game I can definitely recommend.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-03-06,0,0,1573,False,Recommended,"I bought this game quite early and i must say its been quite a ride. i rarely ever drop a review and if i do its normally not anywhere near this detail. if your considering buying this game here are some of the pro's and con's i find most important in this game.Pro The game constantly manage to bring new scenarios be it the gunbattles you have or the lootgame you run.Con Poor client side hit detection or ""CSHD"" you might experience getting shot through a wall or someone exploiding CSHD because pubg is still in an early phase (https //www.reddit.com/r/PUBATTLEGROUNDS/comments/69h6sx/client_side_hit_boxes_ruining_the_game/) *Disclaimer. Cheaters have also posted on above link. The link is only to prove my point of CSHD not promoteing cheating in any way.*Pro The game has a very unique balance between realism and fantasy. Even tho no man would stand after 6 bullets from an AR no matter how much bandage or how many syringes he's got however the aiming strategic camouflage travel speed and distance all makes it far from most FPS games like battlefield Call of duty or even games like Rust.Con Even tho the realism is great the stability of the servers limits the ability to spawn grass and some bushes at larger distance (500m+ less for grass) makeing it mostly useless to use open fields or tall grass to hide in unless in a small circle. Pro Most of the game is based on RNG (Random Number (or item) Generation) this is allows for the scenarios described in first ""Pro"".Con The RNG can seem unfair at times a lot of the game is based on luck makeing this game not as skill based as Counterstrike or League of Legends thereby also makeing it ""Esports unfriendly""Pro The game features both 3'rd and first person gameplay which both are almost uniqe experiences and diffrent playstyles.Con PUBG still doesnt allow you to choose what maps you prefer to play. in my personal experience 3'rd person gameplay on ""Woods"" map is kinda fun as the terrain disallows you from exploiding the camera for very long distances. However the ""Desert"" map becomes nothing but a camper infestation in third person. On the other hand the desert map is very enjoyable in first person as you get to have medium to long range gunbattles more regulary contrary to the ""Woods"" map where things in first person can seem slightly annoying if the circle ends in tall grass and you end up proneing your way arround for serveral minutes. Also the amount of terrain on the ""Woods"" map in first person can become a bit of a nursance in my opinion.Overall i would certainly recommend the game even with its current limits and flaws this game is still young and constantly improveing.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Looking forward to the future development for sure.The only thing that H1 and PUBG have in common is the game mode (Battle Royale).PUBG Better graphics Way better gunplay Cars aren't OP (You have to slow down before you jump out or you will get hurt) You can actually run people over with cars More gun variety (They have already added a new gun since the closed beta) Weapon attachments,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-01-12,0,0,949,False,Not Recommended,As a player in mainland China I agree with the following statement. 作为一名中国大陆地区玩家我认同以下说法来自 Kumiko#RegionLockChinaAs a Chinese player I strongly hope that Bluehole can lock China in the future months. Of course the Chinese players will have their own CN server with the new beginning by Tencent.作为一名中国玩家 我希望蓝洞能在未来几个月内将PUBG锁区 当然 中国玩家仍旧有游玩PUBG的权利 他们会拥有腾讯的国服 The reason that I send this request is because the cheating of Chinese players is starting affected my other games' experience these weeks. My friends and me was blamed even slandered as a cheater just because we are Chinese players. I believe the problems of PUBG is rising to the racial discrimination. Many of my compatriots bring the shame to us and they just use Steam as a launcher of PUBG DDDD之所以做出这个请求 是因为PUBG的外挂问题已经开始影响到我在其他游戏的游戏体验 仅仅因为我是一个中国玩家 我就要被侮辱甚至无故被污蔑成作弊者 我和我的朋友们在近几周遭遇了不少类似状况 我相信PUBG的外挂泛滥已经成为一个现象级问题 或者说 是一个现象级的种族歧视问题 我的部分同胞们对中国玩家这个群体造成了严重的抹黑行为 而他们之中的大部分人只是将Steam作为PUBG的启动器 It's not about the honour of Chinese nationality. It's simply a Chinese player want to get his game experience back. I pay for the games just like most of you. There's no reason that I get a different experience. But Im not going to refute the detractors with any standpoints (if I have). Because I know if I am a foreigner I will do so.这无关中国民族的自尊 我也不认为一个游戏应该上升到这样的高度 这单纯是一个中国玩家想要找回他应得的游戏体验 就像绝大多数玩家一样 我是通过购买来获得游戏的 但我却没有得到我应有的游戏体验 我应该反驳那些攻击我的人吗 不 因为我清楚 如果我是他们 我也会这么做 作弊玩家给正常玩家造成了非常糟糕的游戏体验 就像愤怒的外国玩家对中国玩家们做的那样 If Bluehole is a responsible firm then it should start to consider about the region lock after the open beta of CN server.如果蓝洞是一个有责任感的游戏公司 那么它应该开始考虑锁区的问题了,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

It is literally crippling to the game play because I can't pick up items to compete with the other players until 4 to 10 minutes after the game starts. This game has also crashed twice before the match started and has a massive amount of lag until the game finish loading in the buildings which can take 4 to 10 minutes.I tried multiple rounds and every round I either had the game crash or had to sit still until the game loaded buildings in properly. Anyone who has played this knows you can't really sit still for an extended period of time and accomplish much. What's really sad is that I have a good gaming rig and have put a good amount of money into it yet this early access game that charges $30 to purchase won't run properly on it. If they want us to test for bugs and report it for them they shouldn't be charging more than $15 max.

2018-01-20,0,0,599,False,Not Recommended,I have played many FPSs over the years from vanilla COD to BF4 now PUBG. Like any other FPS PUBG is riddled with aimbotters and wallhacks. You can occassionally get a round in where you get to the final 10 and you get bumped off by a legit player or get the victory. Outside of the hacking the game is quite enjoyable. Graphics are good playability and interface are above average. It is addictive fun. Just don't punch your monitor when that hacker picks you off after you have tactically moved from building to building looting weapons and attachments for 25 minutes. He is running full sprint stops pulls his kar98 and headshots you from 1000m. My other favorite is the AKM with no recoil. classic. No matter how many times you watch the death cam you can't see yourself in the distance. If you can't brush off the cheaters and will ultimately put a fist through your monitor from the frustration I do not reccomend this game. Until the developers come up with a legit anti cheat system (won't happen) I don't reccomend it either. I however will keep playing endless hours of this game because it is my goal to outplay the cheats. Simply because the team play is fun and I am ok with coming in 3rd behind the cheaters.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I frequently get network lag myselfAnd I live in a big city with a reliable provider and a good network plan. yet I will still get 10 second to minute long freeze's. And I have found out that their are three reasons why this happens. 1. it is the beginning of the game and their is a lot of people on the server which sucks for early combat. 2. GETTING SHOT AT!!!!!. 3. Having someone being close to you mid game which sucks for close range combat. And the reason why I can't recommend this to people who have crappy computers is because I have a midrange commputer and had to config graphics files to squeeze 30fps out of this game onalready min maxed settings from a guide.

Graphically it runs well as long as you have a quality build. The variety of weapons vehicles armor all good. Online optimization and desync issues are a huge problem though... and in a purely online game that's a problem. Recoil stutters people glitching around hit detection (this is a big one) 9 times out of 10 the game play is completely random and can even fluctuate on the fly in what you thought was a solid game. Getting top 10 or winning is not a matter of skill the stars have to align.

2017-08-04,0,0,8,True,Not Recommended,It seemed fun at first but unfortunately the only way to be successful is to just hide from everyone and camp until everyone kills each other off. Sure you'll be forced to get into the shrinking play zone but all that means is you'll run into the crosshairs of somebody else camping out and get killed. It's the same gameplay over and over again. It gets old pretty fast. Besides the stale gameplay it seems the developers are going back on promises they made earlier even looking to push out DLC before the game is out of early access. This doesn't bode well for the future of the game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-08-03,0,0,532,True,Not Recommended,Game's optimization is getting worse patch after patch instead of focusing on solving problems like the high amount of lag spikes and poor fps rendering the developers are concentrating on turning this bad written code into an even deeper gold vein by creating a microtransaction abyss like CSGO or TF2. What is more frustrating is the fact that with the latest patches the optimization has run lower and lower with the last one specifically it became totally unplayable.I will recommend this game only when the developers will put their effort into fixing their bad written code and so fix the gameplay.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-23,0,0,95,False,Not Recommended,Don't immedietely move on from this game after hearing this this game has some weird problems. I (along with mostly everyone else) consider this game to be a first person shooter. Sure it may be known for it's battle royal but you can't deny it is an fps at heart. Most first person shooters are quite a bit of fun alone and even more fun with friends. For example Rainbow Six Siege is great alone and (in my review of that I mentioned this) with friends playing casual it is loads of fun. Well in PUBG it isn't fun alone. You might have a lucky game and get a win but that is undescribably rare. With friends that does change to a degree. You can have fun but again it's hard to do that. Everybody brings up the stat of 'you are twice as likely to get struck by lightning that to win your first match of pubg'. This is an... interesting statistic for lack of a better word. I personally think this is a bad thing. Sure it requires loads of skill to win but you will probably never win. Really. It also takes a lot of of time. ALOT . I think that making this game less looting and running around focused (and let me tell you it is that is a vast majority of the time taken in a match) would fix virtualy all of the problems I have with this game. You spend so much time (typically around 20 30 minutes and sometimes even longer) looting and trying to figure out where you're going next and for what? To be instantly killed by a lucky headshot from someone with the best gear in the game and you can't even figure out where they were. This may seem nitpicky but it really is most of the game. Remember how I said in the beginning that this game is an fps? Well it is but it doesn't like up to it. This is a survival game. Yeah. That's a bad thing. PUBG shouldn't remind me of Unturned or Rust even the Long Dark really. You spend 90% of the time looting and just wind up watching the camera zoom out to see them run up from whatever side of the screen and loot your body. You are probably thinking 100 million players can't be wrong and alot of them aren't. Alot of them have spent hundreds of hours and get daily wins. But still not a majority of us will. We will waste a significant amount of time looting and running or driving and I don't find it worh it. This game has potential. They have started taking steps in the right direction for example they have replaced the atrocious jumping disaster with vaulting in 1.0 but this is only one thing. They need to get control of their game and make it a shooter what it is supposed to be. If you have somehow made it through this I hope you found it helpful and I want to bring up how nothing I said is exageration. This game has loads of potential. I mean that. If they put themselves in their place and stop rolling around on their piles of money they can make even more piles of money. So maybe buy this game if you are willing to waste hours you can't get back or wait and rally an army to address the developers and make them fix the simple problems in this game and hopefully we will get the game we deserve.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-11-12,0,0,334,False,Not Recommended,PUBG has a long way to go to become an e sport and you shouldn't hope for too much from this gaming anomaly 1. 30 tick rate is garbage. PUBG servers hand deliver slices of gameplay at a rate comparable to that of your newspaper delivery boy.2. Client side hit detection is fundamentally broken for twitch shooters. You can look forward to being owned by lag owning people with lag and hackers from the far east climbing *all* the way up your butt. Bluehole have unlearned the lessons given to us by Quakeworld in 1997 and it hurts.3. Cheaters are especially painful in a sudden death game. Players will walk away. You should walk away. Your time is more valuable than this. You will be ESP d aim botted double teamed fisted and urinated on and they ll have you actually wondering if it was all your fault.4. Random elements have too much influence on gameplay. The circle will own you far more than players. Lack of vehicles will own you. Lack of armour and meds will own you. You will be owned by everything you can t control. You will have a sniper rifle with a red dot. You will find accessories for all the weapons you haven t got. Roll a die. Did you win? Congratulations! You re having more fun than playing PUBG.5. The pace is to too fast for strategic play. Found a good strongpoint? Who cares? Circle is moving. Wounded a player behind a tree? Give up circle is moving. Just won a tense 10 minute stand off? Doesn t matter you re going to die circle is 7km away.6. Ballistics are garbage. Nothing about the way weapons shoot is realistic. You are unlearning how to shoot by playing this arcade nonsense. Don t lead a car even an inch. Don t compensate for drop even with a crossbow. Nothing makes sense but they re hoping you won t notice. Screw them download ACE and play Arma3 instead.7. The Battle Royale market is set to be flooded by better executed games by companies who possess a single clue. This is an amateurish attempt at a pro game by a guy whose resume amounts to an Arma3 and a H1Z1 mod. Dude I get it we all tried our best with the Arma3 engine but four years of sucking out of that particular hose does not entitle you to an instant win lottery ticket just because you downloaded the Unreal Developer Kit.

2017-12-20,1,1,212,True,Not Recommended,"However good this game might seem to you there are still a lot of underlying issues that have still not been adressed by the team working on this game. Such as Low FPS and often crashing for a lot of lower end pc (i havent encountered this personally but a lot of my friends have) and also another issue that has been surfacing recently after I downloaded the test server was that it couldn't lauch either of the games. It would constantly come up with and error box saying ""Windows cannot access the specified device path or file. You may not ahve the appropriate permissions to access the item"". I think it means that the test server ruins the file path. Also their are more problems with the servers. In the 100 hours of this game I have played at the moment aroud 60 hours of my games I have experienced rubber banding which has resulted in my death multiple times which is very frustrating when you are trying to improve different skills.All I am really getting at is don't expect a good smooth running game when you purchase/if you purchase as their are a lot of frustrating things that ruin the game for me.PS Shroud is an example of the best this game will run on a really good high end PC so dont expect to get that kind of performance unless you are running on a really good PC.

2017-12-22,0,0,227,False,Recommended,I have played this game for day straight. Sadly with my brain being small none of that was recorded on my account but rather my my friend's brother's account. If you get passed all the bugs and glitches in this game it is a VERY fun and addicting game. But I am obliged to tell you all my misfortunes for you to make smart and personalized purchase. When parachuting you can smack something with no effect or you lightly tap a cliff and fall to your doom. (Yes this happened to me) In another instance I got by mortorcycle stuck and started reving it. The sound started to break and partner told me I was breaking the game. Out of nowhere the bike blows up killing me instantly. This one was on me.I have been suspended in mid air a few times. Just simply delaying my landing. These bugs can be triggering to some but I find it easily to pass by.The game makes you rely on luck sometimes. Like who gets a gun first and what gun you get. You may be the one to get a lvl 3 helmet or you might be that person with nothing but a crowbar. But no matter what gear you have the game always seems to keep the excitement ever lasting. Whether running directly through the Red Zone(an area under artillery fire) or out sprinting the the blue force field your heart will be racing. I have heard of hackers infesting the game however I have seen none. I have seen a lot of Chinese on NA servers. Most of them speak enough English that you can get through squad matches with full teamwork. Finally I have to reccomend this game for all the fun I had in the time I played. I even bought it for a friend and got some friends of mine to get it. In their 5 hours they even said it was worth it.P.S. The game isn't optimized for sh*t.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Bluehole does their best and the improvements they've been making have been making the game MUCH better. They listen to community feedback. This game isn't as bad as people say it is. Give it a try if you haven't. You won't regret it. The game functions as your basic battle royale but offers more tactical and slow paced gameplay then games such as Fortnite. This slow paced gameplay doesn't detract from the paranoia or tension you might feel though. It can be over in a second if you make a mistake i.e. stand still for way too long.

The suspense up sneaking up on someone and blasting them along with you trying to stay alive to get that Wnner Winner Chicken dinner! With a great huge open map with towns and small complexes full of loot to the gas closing in on you as time progresses this game is all around fun. You literally want to try and stay alive and play strategic wether it's everyone man for himself or your playing with some buddies. Definitely reccomend its an insanely fun game!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-03,0,0,1144,True,Recommended,"So here's a quick review for an early access Battle Royal game. Pros 1 This game is absolutely addictive. Whether you get into a good match or a bad match you 99% of the time find yourself smashing that ""Play"" button in the hopes that your next match is either better or just as good as your last one. There's just something about it that catches you no matter if it's from the feel of the gunplay or the hilarious things that can happen while in a match. Solo Duo or Squad they're all equally fun.2 The map that is available currently is very well made. There are nice building layouts plenty of terrain barriers to use during combat (excluding open areas which if you get into a gunfight there just remember that YOU chose to go that way) and is big enough to feel large but not so large as to make you feel like you're in some empty land that you have no hopes of seeing anyone for the entire match. 3 The animations feel good overall. Sure there is a little clunkyness here and there and the random arm flail during reloads from time to time with certain weapons but it feels smoother than it's influence which would be Arma. Running jogging crawling leaning. The basics are there. While there is no active adaptive cover system you can find ways to make cover out of just about anything. 4 The development is promising. With the developers offering frequent updates even if they be small ones they are constantly working on the game. This is fantastic when buying into an early access game as you want to see the money you spent on it being used to improve the game. The game has made leaps and bounds since it was opened for everyone to try out and while some people dislike certain changes...they've been working. You won't always be happy with every change or update that's released but the idea that this is an active work in process makes it feel so much better to invest time in.5 The assortment of weapons is ""okay."" But there's not an overly abundant amount of different weapons and once you've used all of them at least once you kind of get a pick of favorites and ones you just absolutely won't touch. 6 Avatar customization though a little limited adds a bit of personal appeal to the game. You don't just hop in as a bland avatar and run around with the same clothing and hairstyle you get to choose small details. Hair. Hair color. Face. Clothing. Etc. This is a great way to personalize yourself in game and I really hope we get to see more on this in the future. 7 The Physics...are entertaining. While not polished they are effective at doing what they do working decently and causing some hilarious situations. Have you ever crossed a bridge on a motorbike and went flipping 3 miles into the air at mach speed? Well you just very well might playing this game! And while this can be a negative I can tell you that when you're playing with friends it's absolutely hilarious. 8 Ambient noise is good. I play this game with a Logitech Artemis G633 headset and I have to say that what I hear really gets me into the game. It gets me involved with my surroundings. With the weather footsteps fading gunfire based on distance vehicle noise reload sounds swimming and even breathing/basic character noises. It all sounds good. 9 Match times are good. This will vary based on how quickly other players die as well as the choices you make. You can either land and get killed instantly or you can end up in the game for a half hour for a single match. It all comes down to how you play luck and aim. Wanna play the sneaky silent type that pops up at the end of the game to pop off the game winning shot? Want to run in guns blazing hopped up on energy drinks and try to mow down everyone in that two story red building? You can do it. And it can all effect just how long you're in a match obviously. Cons 1 Lack of weaponry is a thing. The guns get a little stale and boring after a while. You usually end up with the same loadout match after match and it can just get frustrating that we don't have a bigger assortment of weapons. With a game based entirely on gunplay the most out of left field thing that's available is a frying pan or a machete. I'd really like to see more weapons added on a more regular basis. From your basic AR15's to more obscure weapons like .22 rifles ballistic shields and more bullpup styles. 2 Bland sights is also a thing. Considering that the current map seems to be centralized in Russia (I think) I would assume there would be an assortment of russian style sights. Where are my Chevrons? Where is my height finder so I can use it to figure out how far out the enemy is before I take a shot? The sights besides that little thing are a bit irritating considering that they zoom in your entire screen instead of just the scope lense itself. I would like to see more realistic sighting for the optics instead of just zooming in the entire screen. It adds a weird advantage to trying to take aim on an enemy when you can see his buddy standing 15ft to his right because you can also see outside of the scoped area with full zoom.3 Lots of clothes lack of armor/functionality. This...bugs me a lot personally. In the game there are helmets and vests that offer body protection. That's it. However there are gasmasks ballistic masks and backpacks with metal padding on them that offer no form of protection. In fact they only increase your hit box. Get shot in the backpack that's sticking out behind the tree? It's like you got shot in the back. The level 2 backpack has a large metalic drag plate on the bottom that functions as if it's cloth. The ballistic mask offers no protection. The sunglasses/goggles offer no protection from flashbangs. I feel like they could step this up to add in things like concussive protection if you're wearing a full helmet or mask. Or perhaps even slow the rate of health loss if you're out of bounds and have a gasmask equipped. Offer back protection based on how many items you have in your backpack. Or even allow the items in the backpack to become damaged if the backpack is shot which would make people think twice about shooting it if they're trying to kill someone to loot them. 4 Overall game performance is sketchy. Before this week I was running an overclocked 8320be Setup on a Sapphire 7970xt that was also overclocked. The game would crash regularly. It was unplayable over low settings. The tab to inventory function would cause momentary lag and hangups. In order the play this game in a way that made it feel optimized I had to step up to a Ryzen 1600 32gb of RGB Trident and a 1080 GTX FTW2. This is a lot of money to drop just to see a game feel optimal to play. (And before it's said I play games of various qualities and I wanted to upgrade anywho. I didn't drop that cash just for this game.) That being said people who don't have hardcore or enthusiast based machines may have quite a bit of trouble playing this game so if you just have a hobby setup...you may want to wait for the game to get optimized before investing the money.5 The physics are just as much as con as a pro. You can expect to see grenades bounce into oblivion. Your body to clip through walls objects not render. Be driving down a flat road and unexpectidly stop and explode like you hit something. The motorcycle you're on can go sailing into space and further into the beyond. It happens.Recommendation? Overall I have quite a few hours in this game. It's a top selling game and one of the if not the topped streamed game currently. It's addictive. It can get competitive. Teammates can be funny and very good. Or bad. Whatever. If you can run this game get it. It's fun. You'll love it if you like shooting people. This game adds that ""Ahhh that felt good"" feeling to your heart when you get a good kill. Winning a match is even better. Just do it. You'll have fun I think if you like shoot em up games.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-01-02,0,0,222,False,Recommended,"I have enjoyed playing this game and I wanted to write a review to share my thoughts with others who are looking to purchase the game. I have broken my review down into the Pros Cons some other thoughts and final thoughts Pros 1. Playing online with friends One of the best parts of this game is playing online with your friends. I cannot begin to count the amount of times I have laughed out loud while thrashing around the map in a vehicle. The vehicles are definetly very fun. Online co op with friends adds the fun of playing with friends to the intensity of the survival aspect. 2. Two different maps (Maybe more soon????) The two maps cater to different playstyles and suit different people. The Erangel island map I feel especially caters to beginers and can help one learn the strategies needed to win. The quantity of smaller compouds allows for a safer looting strategy for newcomers yet the presence of larger and more popular buildings like the school provide for the nessesary action for more experienced players. The desert map Miramar tends to have more medium size compounds and less of the more popular and less popular areas. Sure there are high action loot spawns thoughout but it seems as if the Water Treatment plant and Hacienda de Patron (From Miramar) never compare to the school (from Erangel). Nevertheless I enjoy playing both maps. 3. No Pay to win I really like how this game has not been infected with the pay to win bug. The only thing that costs money are crates that you can buy and sell on the Steam Market. Crates have clothing in them but nothing that gives people any advantage. In fact with the battlepoints you earn during the game you can earn crates and even sell them on the Steam Market. I am not a particularly good player but as of now I have earned back $13.38 of the game price by selling the crates I earn in game. Cons 1. Rubberbanding As of the time I am making this review rubberbanding is still an issue on the servers. The development team has made monumental strides in reducing reubberbanding with the full release of the game but it is still prevelent in the early game. It is always very frustrating when you pick up a gun see the looting animation and hear the shuffle of your character pick up an item only to find that immidietly after you picked up your gun your character was slightly shifted out of range to pick up the bullets on the ground. The squatting animation will have already played for each little bullet box but they will somtimes not show up in your inventory. This phenomenon is probably a little confusing to explain somtimes it gets irritating. Rubberbanding also gets annoying if it happens when you are driving but it seems much rarer than it occuring while running. No other major cons right now. I may add some later if I think of it or somthing comes up Other Thoughts It will run on most systems When I first purchased the game it was still very unoptimized and I didn't have a particularly powerful PC. I was playing on an older prebuilt system that I had upgraded with a graphics card. The specs were an i5 650 an 3.2ghz (yes a first gen hyperthreaded dual core) 6gb of 1333mhz ram and a gtx 1050ti. With the old specs on very low settings I could still get a playable 45 fps. Obiously the framerate was not that high but it was pretty consistent for me and I never had major frame dips or drops. I have since upgraded the processor to an i7 870 and optimization patches have been implemented. With new optimization I have been able to increase the quality settings and achieve 50 80 fps depending on the environment. I know that range is quite big but I have noticed different parts of the map have a significant impact on framerate. Hackers Apparently hackers are a big problem on more Eastern and Asian servers but I have never come in contact with any hackers while I have been on the North American servers.Hacking is a very controversial topic and even though I have never encountered a hacker it has significantly affected me. I was banned from PUBG for supposedly hacking and a ""Game Developer"" ban was placed on my steam account. They apparently detected some sort of cheating program on my computer. If you are unfairly banned you can make an appeal on the official PlayerUnkown's Battlegrounds forum in the ban appeal section. If/when you do make an appeal make sure to explain yourself well. Two or three sentences won't cut it. I had a few paragraphs and evidence that there could not have been any sort of ""cheating program"" on my computer. I am glad that they are working to remove unwanted cheaters from the game but don't be afraid if you accidently get banned. Final Thoughts (This is the tl dr part) This game is fun and action packed. I would highly recomend playing with your friends even gift it to them if they're stingy. $30 is a great price for a new game especially considering the price of other AAA games that have been out for years and still in the $60 range. Don't worry to much about the ability of your PC to run this game. As seen before I started out with a low spec rig and was still able to have fun playing it. This game is definetly worth your money and I highly recommend it.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-11-16,0,0,269,True,Recommended,I bought PUBG a couple of weeks ago mainly missing the big hype wave. The large amoutn of negative reviews the game has recently received had me worried about the game in general. However if you've seen video of the game being played and thought it looked fun it is still that game.PUBG has a fairly steep learning curve I spent my first few games hiding in bushes and going to extremely obscure houses only to get murdered the second I came across another more experienced player.After a couple of weeks of playing I feel much more comfortable with the game and it's become a genuinely very enjoyable experience though currently only one map you can have a pretty large range of 'game types' depending on where you land and how you play.Yesterday the beginning of my game consisted of two guys chasing me around a tree in their UAZ while someone else took pot shots at all 3 of us it was pretty funny.The more you learn the game and get used to it's controls/mechanics the more fun you will have which I think is a big plus missing from a lot of titles that come out these days.I'd recommend this game to anyone who enjoys PVP fps and to an extent the rpg esque draw of finding loot in your environment.

2017-08-01,0,0,86,True,Recommended,Soooo I've got a few hours into this game now I feel like I can review it. First off I do recommend this game. A lot of people are saying no because they are upset that the dev added micro transactions. But I personally don't care because if you actually care about what your person looks like in the game that's kinda silly because it's really only you who will ever actually know what you look like because combat happens very fast in close quarters or at range where you can't tell if the person has black or brown fingerless gloves.Anyway The game itself is very fun and very addictive. Every match is different because every match everyone starts from scratch. Scavange new guns clothes etc. I've had matches where I need to search 4 buildings just to get a handgun with some extra rounds and others I've dropped onto a house that had everything i could possibly need.I've had multiple rounds now that I've made it to top 10 and 1 match where I came in 2nd. Let me tell you you've never been more dissapointed for coming in 2nd place in your life. You fight you survive all this time and with the playable field getting smaller just to get it stripped away last second.There are some down sides controls can be a little clunky and sometimes picking up items can be a pain if they're too close to each other on the floor. But overall for an early access game I've been very surprised at the overall quality.as it is right now I'd give it an 8/10. It's an extremely fun game but it does have some flaws that keep it from being astounding. However those will likely be addressed at some point between now and official release.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

But here comes 1.0 with a slew of actual improvements on the game and a very refreshing map. I love the desert theme way more. It feels way more alive and interesting. The ability to climb over barriers and into windos ect. was exactly what I had been begging for. This game went from alright to pretty good for me and I can justify the 30 bucks I dropped on it now.

2017-09-18,0,0,94,True,Recommended,Right so here we go...PUBG Is a great game with many of the current popular game element like the surival and apocalyptic aspects and gave it a very unique twist which is highly addicting. I've played DayZ but that was just a little bit too slow paced for my liking. I didn't really feel a sence of purpose or direction of what to do there and could literally be walking for 8 hours and find a rotten apple and a shirt.PUBG Is fast paced and action packed with the red zone and the permitted fighting zone continuously getting smaller definately gives you a thrill and rush of adrenaline.HOWEVER Performance and Stability wise there needs be a LOT of improvement. And I'm getting the impression the DEVS have put their priorities in all the wrong directions. There are simple performance and coding issues which should be resolveable with a patch in a day.... Which now many of us players are having to arrange ''fixes'' for certain bugs issues ourselves.I know this is early access alpha whatever... But there are TONS of minor issues MORE important then streamers live streaming ETC. Try and fix these first before you start losing trust of your players and then move on to getting publicity etc. Nobody has ever becomes successfull promoting a broken buggy game.I mean is there still a ''DEVELOPMENT'' TEAM? or just a Marketing and Finance department?Anyway... That will be all for now. I'm still enjoying the game and I will keep playing as of yet...

I started out by getting mad like ""OMG is he hacking?"" and sometimes people are. But now I can review my mistakes with the death cam feature and get better at positioning with my teammates and learn from my past experiences. I am glad they reworked the main menu options and now you can the pick maps. I enjoyed the fog maps in the past because they were fun it hilariously funny when I walked right over somebody in the middle of a fog map. I used to get angry if I died but now I can review how and say if he was cheating in my opinion or not. Nowadays people are getting better and better.

2018-06-22,0,0,1365,False,Recommended,So many people are downvoting pubg because of obvious decisions bluehole is making to monetize their game beyond its 30 dollar price tag. I get where many of these people are coming from but at the end of the day aslong as it does not effect actual gameplay I cannot be arsed. Sure there used to be a time where games would include these things in their games from the get go but stop clinging on to that because it simply makes alot of money for a company.But then the debates shifts to not many changes are being made to the actual games from netcode to game design. Ladies and gentlemen programming and making games require a truckload of time and resources. Pubg has come so far from when it started and its much better then it used to be. Coding in a shop and making new skins is relatively simple compared to messing around with game mechanics and the core code of the game. But we are all aware that the team that works on the store front and skins has nothing to do with the actual coding of the game. As for netcode its always going to be a iffy subject since there is alot of things that go into it I would suggest watching https //www.youtube.com/watch?v dOVwu517GmI this video it will hopefully enlighten you on the subject a bit.Next up is cheaters.... Really.. Yes they are there but bluehole definately is trying to make tolerable they will never ever get fully rid of them. Cheater excisted all the way back in the 90's and they have never been put to a full stop and now people expect bluehole to pull a magic wand out of their and fix the problem. Yeah good luck with that.Now these seem to be the main point that people burn the game off on for the moment. Is the game perfect hell no. But its not as bad people make it out to be. The gunplay is one of the best you will find the graphics are not battlefield like but are good enough for what its trying to do. But when pubg was created they had limited resources and trying to create graphics on par with a game like battlefield takes some serious know how and time investment something bluehole did and probably still does not have. The sounds are good although the sound system (knowing where shots are coming from ect) can be pretty wonky at times. As for gameplay I get it its not for everybody the skill level between players can be pretty steep so if you are not used to FPS games you are going to have a rough time. But for those that have that experience don't expect constant action from begin to finish all the way but it comes and goes without warning. But that why there is always that sense of danger hanging around. But when does hit the fan you will be satisfied coming out on top. Also I need to point out that if really want to you just take a vehicle and just look for trouble which usually does not take that long to find.I have some gripes with the game sure but for the time being I am enjoying myself when playing it. I get the feeling many might actually enjoy the game but are just salty about certain decisions blue is taking. Even though I agree with them in some extend I don't believe the game at its core is bad experience.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Many discord servers and other communities willing to organize tournaments and other such events. All the people who are babies for paying for cosmetics are the babies themselves if you truly are having fun with this game you give two about that part of the game...And of Course the countless amounts of people disliking and making bad reviews about this game just because a couple of people who killed streamers and got banned or honked with a car nearby. NOTE these ing incidents happen months ago and the devs no longer ban players for just killing streamers because ive done it before and nothing ing happened (i killed summit1g) These people are actually realizing there in a game with a streamer opening twitch finding where they are and purposly troll them. I dont advocate for the streamers they know what theyre getting into and actually like the combat from streamsnipers now...My point is dont ing listen to these negative reviews over the opinion of two non related game aspects. Cosmetics and the stream sniping isuue. The game is fun it will get you pumped angry excited and scared. A worthwhile experience worth every penny....And other people reading my who disagree no one cares about youre bias opinion. You complaining about streamers whining is going to do anything....

2018-01-18,0,0,682,False,Not Recommended,"Tl Dr State of the game play right now late betaState of the game on steam store full releaseConclusion game released too soon devs dont care about player experienceShould you buy it give it till summer and check the state of the game then.Long version I can play the game fine and without problems by that i mean that I DO experience terribly low FPS (my machine is around recomended) terrible FPS lag spikes whenever something happens ingame (players dying explosions spawning of planes etc) terrible rubberbanding (not always can play any online fps with no problems) random crashes to desktop(every three matches or so) not getting points for winning (supposed to be fixed now but that was happening while the game was out of early access so it shows pretty much about the state of the game)And those things account to playing the game just FINE both my friends literally cannot play the game because of constant crashing upon landing constant spam of ""network lag detected"" joined by extreme rubberbanding to the point of not being nable to pick up items 5 mins into the match buildings not loading buildings loading only in some parts not loading of items and interactable objects (like doors)And those not loading errors do not go away after time in match (that is if you survive despite them).So to my knowledge the game is unplayable i 2/3 of cases (66% that is) and the other 1/3 is acceptable only in early access games (which it is no longer).My opinion game sholud not have left early access yet should have stayed there for half a year more at least. Imagine something like that happening in games like battlefields and call of dutys. Im fine with games not working right while in early access but the moment they decided to go into full release thats like jumping into a stormy ocean after learning how to swim in 0 5m deep water in a swimming pool. Also gives the players some expectancy as to the state of the game which is still at earl y acces level. While Im having some fun playing the game the bugs sometimes discourage me from playing it for more than a week. Its really frustrating to get good equipment and survive into last 20 only to have the game crash without even giving you any explanation as to what happened.Seriously how in the living hell did the devs decide its a good idea to go into full release with game beign this brokenEdit some grammar.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-03-07,0,0,315,False,Recommended,The game is challenging . The map weapons are good. Met 4 or 5 cheaters during my 150+ hours gameplay so that is quite acceptable. Just keep working and improving on the anti cheat system and it will be alright. The devs are pretty good enough to keep the updates on Facebook or Reddit so we can get the news as soon as possible. But there is a issue that really bothers me which is the Server problem. 40% of the time you will get a server busy problem that is really annoying when you have friends teaming up to have some fun. Just solve the server problem as soon as possible. Another thing that is really annoying is the PUBG community Sure the cheating problem is there but the devs are working hard on it and they keep updating us on the Facebook which is really good for a game developer. If you guys really off of PUBG devs thn play DayZ and see whether the devs give a about you guys or not. And for the guys keep complaning about the cheating problem maybe it is just you suck in this game and blame on the cheaters a lot . Played with chinese players and they are really not that bad communicating is not a problem for me because i understand chinese too.7.5/10 for the game.

2017-05-09,1,1,351,True,Recommended,This game is highly addicting and very fun and engaging especially when played with friends duo or squad mode. a Few cons though as it is still early access.

Clearly random matchmaking is an intended feature and it's really fun to play... That is when you can actually communicate with your team. 95% of the time if you try to matchmake randomely you won't find anyone that speaks a lick of English and the times that you do there are still Chinese players.

2017-09-23,0,0,116,True,Not Recommended,Short version The game is fun however you will run into all sorts of problems all the time. Wait for updates.The game is plagued by issues that are not being addressed. Instead of fixing these things we get some unnecessary things like microtransactions for lootboxes forcing post processing and shadows for all players even though it ruins the fps even more and making it near impossible to crouch jump. Early game desync. Combat looting and even doing any other action like opening doors right at the start of the game feels unresponsive. In this period it's very common to miss on loot die behind a cover to a guy and even having to open the door twice or more.Performance. Desync is not the only issue in the early game. If you don't have very powerful computer prepare that your textures might take a while to load. I am talking around 2 minutes maybe even more. In this time you can fall through textures be stuck in textures can ride a vehicle through houses. Even stronger computers might not get 60fps all the time. And after last few updates it gets even worse. Forced post processing forced shadows pushing the fps even lower.Melee combat in this game is embarassing. I don't understand how it can be in the game considering how broken it is. You can stay next to a person attack them with a melee weapon without landing a hit on them. It gets even worse when they are downed. And it doesn't help that you need to hit a person few times with a melee weapon.RNG deciding way too many things. It's fine to decide what loot spawns where or where the zones are even though sometimes you get magically screwed by the zone being on the other part of the map and you spend majority of the game on the run. What is not acceptable is having the RNG decide map for you. I don't want special weather map I prefer the default one. Getting into a lobby 4 times only to find the game will have special weather is annoying. Another thing is red zones that you can sometimes run through other times the first two shells fall right at you.Many other smaller issues. The game doesn't save your queue options if you are playing solo. Queueing first person on EU server? After the game it will be defaulted to third person on Asian servers. Some things are very loud. You better mute the in game sound when in a plane / buggy because otherwise you won't hear your teammates. Rain is also quite loud but you can't do anything about that. Crouch jump a mechanic that makes the movement a lot more fluid is near impossible to do consistently. Even the best players in the game aren't able to do it and developers decided rather than making it easy for everyone it should be very hard 'mechanical' skill.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Map is detailed there are many unique towns and cities which all contain different loot and rewards the bigger the place the riskier but more good loot the smaller less risky but less loot Wide variety of weapons There are many weapons you can pick up on your journey of the arena like machine guns pistols shotguns snipers and many blades Cons Server issues ive found myself dying from lag having my death delayed by 30 seconds Toxicity i have seen alot of toxic players on this game especially when i knock someone out they end up yelling swears and racial slurs for example the word n****r has been said alot Verdict There are things that can be improves and the community is a bit toxic but in my opinion the game is worth the buy and i would never go back on the purchase if i had the choice,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Not having played a battle royale genre game before It was one of the most exciting adrenaline inducing and overall fun games that I've played in a very long time. I'll even say that this is probably my favorite game to date. However in the last month I have experienced an excess of hackers/cheaters and it takes away from the entire experience. I've read the articles boasting the amount of cheaters being banned per day but it seems that almost half of the games that I play in a day end with being killed by an invisible player shooting my entire team out of a car with a shotgun or a flurry of bullets that instantaneously kill my entire team. I just hope that BattlEye can get ahead of these hackers so that everyone can go back to enjoying the game.

You get so excited when it is just your team and one other team and you get aim botted. The devs need to do something about cheating. Also if you are a cheater in this game why? It's stakeless.

2018-05-25,0,0,470,False,Not Recommended,Could be an awesome game but the servers and faulty mechanics ruin 80% of the joy.... I can actually see my bullets hit 3 times because of 3 times blood splatter on the enemy when I look at the death cam it shows he didn't get hit at all... I shoot on the enemy most of the times but ending up with no hits at all even though it should... I can click on picking up an item like 10 times before something happens and I can pick it up... I can try scoping from the car over and over and over and nothing happens.... I can try vaulting through a window and it takes like 5 clicks before i can actually get inside/outside. The ing character cant even jump over an ankle high obstacle sometimes because the game mechanics are useless...Hate this game but also get addicted because it could be awesome if servers and mechanics weren't so bad....,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-05-03,0,0,210,True,Recommended,Overall I like this game a lot but I decided to make a list of pros and cons to help whomever this may concern with their decision.Pros Graphics not too shabby when turned up Lots of hours worth of gameplay Offers more intense and engaging play than any other game in the genre Offers all different styles of play so you can play how you want Never the same situation twice Great weapon mechanics Great map design Big map Fast Matchmaking Devs are constantly adding new guns vehicles mechanics and optimizationsCons Yes their are hackers here and there but I don't feel they affect my gameplay any more than the occasional aimbotter on any other shooters Yes it's poorly optimized my 4th gen i7 16gb ram and gtx980m run it around 35 42fps in heavy load situations and around 60 68fps in light load situations plan accordingly. Lots of racist micspam when you load in (fix this by pressing ctrl+t) You can spend 20 minutes peacefully looting only to be one shotted from an unknown location. (although I don't want them to get rid of one's ability to do that it's just frusterating sometimes)Overall I'd highly recommend it most of the problems are fixable or being fixed by the devs. It's really fun and you probably won't regret it.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

This was one of the first and biggest Battle Royale games before Fortnite came along and ripped them off and after Fortnite everyone seems to want to make a BR call of duty grand theft auto and tons of other random developers. Why are sooo many companies trying to copy PUBG? Because it is a great game that pioneered a new genre because hundreds of thousands (yes that many) people are playing it. They are still updating it fairly often. I was sceptical at first but after purchasing it I fell in love. This game is amazing. The graphics are great gunplay is phenomenal feeling of winning is the best. I have never encountered a hacker in all my 170 hours that I currently have logged. I don't know if people are just trash and are accusing people that are good of being hackers without even watching the killcam or what? I would really like to know because I don't see it. Maybe they see other reviews of people claiming there are hackers and they just want to jump on the hacker bandwagon I don't really know but this is a great game and I highly recommend it. 9/10,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-01-26,0,0,175,False,Not Recommended,Hello over the past few weeks I've seen large numbers of forum members here and other platforms voicing their legitimate concerns over the vast numbers of Chinese players taming over the NA servers and I wanted to offer you all some suggestions that may alleviate this growing issue. There are several reasons that they are a problem which I will list below. 1. This is a voice chat communication game. Americans and Canadians select this server to understand their teammates. When you join a squad or duo and the other person cannot speak English it causes gameplay issues. 2. The majority of cheaters are Chinese and the best anticheat solution is to region lock the servers. This will reduce the cheaters greatly. 3. Chinese Nationalism is an issue here. No other citizen I can think of from any nation comes into this game screaming (Insert you country here) is number one and this is also an issue because most of the time if you are paired with 3 other Chinese people don't expect help from them or possibly risk being team killed because your not one of them. (Yeah Brendon Greene were the xenophobes ok...) I remember when I first got this game and I didn't know it put me on the AS server and I was the only American in my squad. Next match I selected the NA server where I belong and I was squared with 3 more Asians. I thought to myself I can't tell the difference in the servers.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Psst.. did I mention you can also play this with your friends in a duo or squad mode depending on your numbers?! You start out by parachuting out of a plane at whatever destination on the map you would like depending on where the plane is flying and gather weapons from buildings or off of dead players as they are killed or at times beaten to death. (the action can start almost immediately after the first person lands) There are even a few vehicles in the game you may drive around the map and bash some commie... I mean uh.. hostile players (And if you're a . friendly players)! This leads to the gas cloud as my friends and I refer to it as. Basically it limits the playable areas of the map over time and gets smaller every few minutes after the initial five minutes of 'get your gear and go!' This large force field looking entity constricts after a cycle and if you are outside of it your health will drain slowly or if the game is close to an end quickly.OH!

2018-04-01,1,1,592,False,Not Recommended,I'm not going to say anything that millions haven't said before. This game is the most fun worst game I've ever played. It seems like a contradiction but the game itself is really fun when most of it works which is exceedingly rare. Each update promises to fix bugs except for every 1 bug they fix 10 new ones spring up. As of today the most recent bug I can think of is sound related where gunshots sound closer or further than their origin giving you no real clue of where you're getting shot from. The weird thing is that all of the bugs are not easily reproduced. They show up in one game then you queue up for another one and that particular aspect is fine while usually having some other weird bug like when vehicles especially the 2 wheel bike just randomly glitches into the ground blowing you up.Some bugs are more reliable like when your inventory is full and you can t drop equipped attachments to the ground and you have to drop something in your inventory first. Makes sense right?The act of playing this game a lot is a bit like being a far gone drug addict who hates his living situation but the drugs still give him such a rush even though it s never as good as the memory of that first hit he has to keep using.All in all a horribly broken piece of mess yet still a ridiculously fun game.

2018-03-28,0,0,27,False,Not Recommended,"I dont usually give reviews for games as i m often satisfied with the games i choose to play but i have to make an exception for this game. first this isnt a bad game. not as bad as people make it to be. the bugs arent that bad and i havent encountered any obvious cheater. however i can only recommend this game to 2 very specific kind of gamers. this game would be worth it if u have a pro friend (or friends) to play with. or if u r alone and u would to spend hundred of hours on it. the first 20 30 hours would be dedicated to practicing. i have spent 20 hours in this game and the amount of frustration that it gave me far exceeds the amount of joy. now i have to admit that i REALLY suck at the game as i dont have much experience with shooters. but its not just the shooters aspect that got me down. the learning curve here is almost as steep as dota 2. during these twenty hours i have killed no more than 20 people which comes back to 2 3 games per kill. i ve seen a forum where a guy did some statistics on the matchmaking system and the results were less than fair. Bluehole focuses on shorter queue time over fair matching. i dont blame them on this aspect because i understand that its not easy to match 100 people together but it does make it extremely hard for newcomers. i ve watched dozens of videos on pubg on youtube teaching how to be better but in short it really only comes with the amount of hours you put into the game. the majority of times i get killed by campers people with better weapons people who just happened to get me from behind 3 seconds after i checked my surroundings or just straight up losing a gunfight cuz he s a better shooter. in solo games i usually just spend most of my time (around 20min) getting loots just to be killed by someone cuz i let me guard down for 5 seconds. i ve seen people saying that i should drop into hot zones just to practice but 9 times out of 10 someone comes to kill me with a better weapon. if i cant find a weapon he kills me with a pistol. if i get a pistal he kills me with a shotgun if i have a shotgun he kills me in a distance with AKM. and if u cant find a x4 or x8 scope u would be severely disadvantaged in the late game. if i dont die in the early game i die late game by someone with a x4 or x8 scope. i understand that it s all about ""git gud"" but it will takes dozens of hours before that happens and i just dont find it fun to be killed over and over for 20 30 hours (maybe even longer). squad (4 players team) isnt much better. usually when i play squad 1 2 people in the team don have a mic and 1 2 people will die right after landing. if u are patient enough and are willing to spend dozens of hours going through the ""git gud""s frustration u WILL enjoy this game once u finally get there. it s a fun game but extremely unfriendly towards newcomers.i just cant put up with it anymore and this is coming from someone who has beaten ""dark souls"" and ""ninja gaiden"" on ""master ninja mode"". just to give an example the frustration from fighting ""the nameless king"" in dark souls 3 or the ""test of valor"" on master ninja mode in ""ninja gaiden 2"" was NOTHING compare to what i experienced here.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-10-25,0,0,124,True,Recommended,really cool system they have in this game new fresh look too FPS games fun and exciting if you are a fan of fps games this game will 100% get your adrenaline going like never before those moments you get into a fire fight and you and your opponent keep missing and your frantically trying to reload and your heart is racing and hands shaking. It is fun BUT the whole process of going from game to game takes a very long time and some scenarios are you drop in a hot zone and die instantly or drop safe and spend the next 30 min sneaking around and die at the very end without a kill the game still has bugs and some parts of the game ARE NOT Smooth but all around it is a very fun game but does have downsides. I recommend this game if you enjoy FPS!(one downside i notice is that there is no ranking system so you can get pro level fps gamers in a game and you instantly lose cmon lets get a place us noobs can play and actually stand a chance),PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

They fear nothing because when the screen snaps in any given direction that means its time to click and fire. Snipers fire without the need to lead their shots for their bullet travel time is exactly 0. One valiant squad shores up it's defenses and puts up a fight knocking a few chinese chargers to their knees but despair sets in as their comrades heal them without need of the 10 second heal delay. They spam 8 bandages in a matter of 2 seconds.The tide rolls on no end in sight.They don't care about chinese hackers because in China its acceptable.

2017-04-24,0,0,233,True,Recommended,"Have you ever wondered ""what would have happened if they gave you guns in the hunger games?""? it turns out a lot less romance and a lot more killing.TL DR costs as much as a pizza but lasts longer.Pros Even though its early in development there are very few bugs things will come up every now and then but they are fixed rather quickly.Fun it is intense the looting adds a sense of loss when you get a good gun then die but not a frustrating one like DayZ where you loot for days and one slip up or internet hiccup and you lose everything and there isn't that strong of an urge to hoard things because a match will only last 30 mins at the most and that's if you are good at hiding or good at killing.so far a nice community yeah we get the toxic COD people who just want to sprint in holding down the fire button but they are mostly in Solo in the week I've been playing all of my random squads have been polite and good at following directions.Easy to communicate with your squad (if you all speak the same language that is...) the 360 compass makes it easy to tell your team exactly what direction to look and the ability to mark the map lets you show them exactly where something is.Realistic gun play (Besides that one revolver that takes the wrong kind of 7.62 ammo and can be silenced despite being a revolver). The guns feel very realistic. with bullet drop and zeroing in scopes for ranged shots it takes a lot of skill to be a good sniper something I am working on becoming.Cons being early access there isn't a lot of customization options they will fix it in time but you will need to pay 10 40 matches worth of in game money depending on how good you are to change your character when they add new options which won't be much of a problem.the loot boxes you can buy for cosmetic clothing items double in price every time you buy one so it can be a bit frustrating when you get duplicates the price resets on Monday though so its not as bad as it could have been but still if you get something you don't want or a duplicate it will sell for barely anything hopefully they add trading later.Clunky Melee Weapons I found a sickle and armor in my first house and fought some unarmed unarmored guy and the swinging was so slow he never got hit and killed me with punches. so it has a chicken with its head cut off system of fighting where you run back and forth spamming attack usually the sprint and jump punch.bad car mechanics getting in and out of a car is pretty much a teleport and can be pretty clunky like you will hit F and nothing will happen or if you die in a car you just fall out or if you throw a grenade it just falls through the floor.I didn't pre order yes this is a con by the time I learned this game existed (Thanks to Node) it was too late to pre order and get the pre order gear which is the best cosmetics in the game at the moment in my own opinion.Things I wish for a practice shooting range where I can learn how some of these guns work would be nice try out the attachments maybe a driving course to learn the floaty driving system. I tried to turn a boat around in a random squad match and got it stuck on a rock... luckily my team was nice about it...Wildlife. the island is pretty dead with only birds and plants. some deer rabbits wolves/dogs running around would increase the paranoia by a lot give the snipers a distraction in the distance so your head doesn't just explode while you are getting in a car. and gives you snapping twigs to jump at when you are in the woods.more buildings such as Police/Fire Stations Imagine being able to find a fire suit to protect you from a Molotov or in the future flame throwers police stations with a higher spawn rate of police grade gear and grocery stores to find food from right now the random cities are pretty much gas stations a hospital and random apartment buildings/houses. they need some more variety in building types to make the city feel more like people once lived in it and not that some crazy rich guy just built it and fill it with garbage just so his 100 interns could fight to the death in it.flammable objects I want to be able to set things on fire as a trap or to cover my escape with a plume of smoke like the wheat fields and random houses.More maps in different countries yeah Russia is your best bet for a first map but imagine Australia with its large open deserts and everything wanting to kill you or (after much optimization) the abandoned super cities of China that were built but no one ever moved into. or the fridged wastes of Antarctica where you would have to protect yourself from the freezing cold with the cloths you find or risking drawing people to you (or setting up ambushes) by starting a fire to keep warm no wall of death necessary just find people by fallowing the smoke.All in all this game in its current state is totally worth your $30 its entertained me longer than a pizza would have so I am glad I threw it at this game instead if you have modern hardware that is. your old FX processors and GTX 750TIs will have some trouble running the game. you won't have a lot of fun if it freezes up every time it studders when someone comes close to you just trying to load in their cloths/guns.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-06-10,0,0,659,True,Recommended,PUBG is a really fun last man standing style survival game. You can play solo as a duo or in a squad of four people. Every match has 100 players no matter the play mode as I just listed above. Your plane flies you over the island at a random vector and as soon as it flies over usable land upi cam jump and parachute down to a desired location. You can really jump at any time you like but you have to do it before the plane reaches the far side of the island or you get booted out. Pick your spot well because you're going to be scrounging for loot.Weapons are a mix of melee submachine guns semi automatic rifles and sniper rifles. There are also grenades of varying kinds and other minor support items. The goal is to equip yourself and stay alive. As soon as everyone has landed the game designated a safe play area by a white circle on a random portion of the island. After 5 minues a blue energy barrier will start to close in forcing players in to the white circle or be forced to take ticking damage until they die. As the game progresses the play area gets smaller and smaller until there is only one person or team left alive. Most games last around 30 minutes total but you can get killed at any time. I like that there's no guarantee of a win even if you try to hide for most of the match. You eventually get forced out in to the open and you will be required to fight for you life. The biggest rewards come from being the last man standing.For a game that's in early access I think it's in pretty good shape. I have some nit picks about performance especially server side but over al it operates pretty well. Hit registration can be a little off and the server tick rate can sometimes misrepresent player position. On the upside the devs are constantly working on updates and it's good to see they are regularly working on performance as well. I hope they don't add to much more in the way of weaponry. I think the gear as it stands now is fine.Edit The addition of first person mode has been pretty awesome. It's makes for a much more tactical experience. New weapons are also always a blast. I look forward to vaulting and the new map.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-01-25,0,0,250,False,Not Recommended,I can not genuinely recommend this game and here is whyThe game has a lot of flaws1. Buggy still feels like alpha but they claim it is fully released2. Hit detection is horrible. I'd ran into far too many scenarios where bullets don't register or feel super wonky3. RNG based shooters feels really really unrewarding the majority of my deaths are simply because the enemy found a weapon first after landing. You spend your time in lobby pre game airplane parachuting and then looting just to die to something RNG based. The mid game is horrendously slow you have this rng based first couple minutes4. Boring mid game after everyone in your town as died out to the last surviving team/player you have a horribly long wait till any more action this part is roaming and looting hoping for some rng based goodies to come your way.5. Squads can be a huge joke because if one of your squad mates dies early they have to wait forever until the game is over and what they do get to watch is just endless looting until the rare occasion you see someone. 6. There is a horrendous balance of downtime to action in a game you often spend 90% or more of your time not actually fighting it's usually looting and looking for more loot. The fights themselves about 75% of the time are very unrewarding fights because typically it feels like whoever won the fight had better RNG based loot or got to a building and camped it before you got there(I don't mind camping in shooters but when you have so much downtime and so many deaths come from campers it gets boring)7. Unrewarding gameplay for the first part of the game i often feel all of my kills are not even earned it's simply because I found a weapon first or found the better weapon/gear. Other times it's because I spotted the enemy first and picked them off before they had an opportunity to shoot at me the rar eoccasion where it is a fair and even gun fight does feel pretty good but even then with horrible hit detection there are times where bullets dont register or bullets do register but in weird ways like after one player has already got behind a wall for cover and the bulelt registers late because the tick rate on PUBG is very bad8. Beginning loot is laggy when you first land you usually have to spam the f button about 20 times to pick up a gun and some ammo it just feels super because you land with tons of other players and sometimes you could be right beside someone and ur spamming f to pick up a weapon while they are reloading their gun the game doesn't even give you an opportunity to fight sometimes.9. Cheaters are an issue and actually a big issue. Typically in games I find ther eisnt a big issue with cheaters there may be the odd one you spot but often it's not enough to ruin the game This game has a lot of cheats and they are easy to get they also sometimes seem hard to spot there is a no recoil hack a program that shows everyone on the map auto aim/aimbot speed hack and more. The problem is some of these may go undetected because you get picked off and think you just genuinely lost the fight and then when you look at the death cam you see they have no recoil or that their aim suspiciously snapped to your head I've ran into more cheaters on this game within a bit over 100 hrs than i've ran into cheaters on league of legends with over 2000 hrs10. Community it's just toxic and with how much downtime and the unrewarding system put in place you just find tons of people salty and unwilling to care or try. You typically only ever want to play with people you know.The only reason I'm still playing this is because I don't have a lot of FPS games atm and I'm waiting for Hunt Showdown to come out so I wanted something to practice my FPS skills It's also nice to just sell every crate I get because it adds up and I've already bought a game with the money earned so that's pretty much all I'm doing is trying to earn the money from the crates in this game to afford Hunt Showdown. If you guys are looking for some fair gun fights and enjoyable gameplay I'd keep your eye on Hunt Showdown. This game is going to eventually die out if the devs don't pull their heads out of their ases,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-22,0,0,123,False,Recommended,PUBG is by far the most advanced and well executed battle royal style title out there. Whilst there are other less buggy less elasticbandy clones out there the shear size of PUBG's two maps and enhanced mechanics exceed the ability of games such as H1Z1 or Fortnite. Although the early game netcode stability is lacking the combined unmatched longevity of its rounds and excessive skill ceiling make for a fresh exhilarating experience that has not been achieved in the gaming market for quite some time.The release optimization has improved tenfold since early access and PC specs are no longer as demanding.

2017-08-31,0,0,607,True,Recommended,PUBG is the type of game where it starts off with not caring too much if you die in the first few minutes (approx 90 players alive) after a little while and some reasonable loot and gear has been found you would prefer not to die at this point but still not too fussed if you die (approx 60 70 players alive). After the 3rd/4th blue circle You start to believe that you can achieve the impossible...you could possibly win...you'll taste the sweet fruits of victory...(10 players remaining)...you've made it to top 10....but you still want more....no more mistakes or joking around now...you're close....(last 2 players)...you believe in this...you can win! and then you're enemy make an idiotic mistake. and then you win as #1Welcome to the battleground.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

That is mainly in part that I don't have the best graphics card and don't have much RAM or a very good processor.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-03-30,0,0,31,True,Recommended,Expensive for early access but almost certainly worthwhile if you have the money spare. While I still regard Early Access overall as a 'really bad thing' this game as it currently stands is pretty good fun. A random spawn in/parachute drop and then shoot everyone else game. Solo or squad play is supported. Tension is plentiful as is randcomness so if you don't like the odd game where you land with no chance and no gear this isn't the mode for you. But the RNG just makes the whole thing more fun anyway. You'll get plenty of oppertunities to gun down people armed with nothing more than fists while you pop away fully geared and armed with an assualt rifle if you play long enough. As often you'll be the one running away It's a little buggy no worse than the Arma Battle Royal mod but there's enough content to keep you going . I don't know if it's official but there does seem 'room' for a cosmetics crate system that will probably be added later on. That's a personal guess though so do your own research if you're concerned.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-04-04,0,0,129,True,Recommended,Great game that sits right in the middle of Arma with its high detail and complexity and H1Z1 with its arcadey unrealistic gameplay. This balance lends itself to make Battlegrounds currently the best battleroyale game out on the market so far.The gunplay feels good and weighty without being too realistic with each gunfight you get into especially with multiple people feel tense requiring supressive fire from teamates and actual tactics instead of just everyone rushing into a building and shotgunning everybody to deathBetter than Arma in that the engine was actually built for this kind of game making it less clunky and complex. Better than H1Z1 in that the game isn't a bugged out mess that has effectively been abandoned.For a game that isn't even finished yet it is surprisingly well polished. There are enough weapons in the game for it not to get stale with a large enough map (8km x 8km) that is well though out enough so that players don't all end up in one area that holds all the loot.The opitimisation is admittedly but the devs have promised to improve on it in the coming months. They've already added Oceania and South American servers so expect more updates to drop.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-11-11,0,0,304,False,Recommended,I know this game still isn't released and it still has it's quirks and there are large updates yet to come but this is definitely the best game on the market by a longshot. Already it has surpassed CS GO and Dota in terms of maximum amount of players at one time which was well over 1M. I have about 230 50 hours on this game and already I'm addicted. The community is toxic but that's just what makes this game better. It's all about rivalry and honour loses you the game. You play dirty sneakily or full on rambo and it's just so much fun. It is Free For All (FFA) and there are 100 players in a match. The whole map is 8x8 km squared. Wow. The ballistics are fantastic in this game with bullet drop being realistic for different guns and calibers of bullet range is fantastic environmental interaction is great and the game forces you to keep moving otherwise it would be boring to just sit there and kill the odd passer by. The feel of winning is rushing and exhilirating and it is so worth thr $30 you pay for it. People go on and on about games like Battlefield 1 and Cod WW2 saying how great they are but when they see this game you can bet that their jaws will drop.

Becuase its trash like literal trash. I started up the game everything was fine but when I load in the game doesn't even give you tutorial on what to do and what are the controls obviously there is the control layout menu but who needs that if the game could give you a quick introduction to everything? That's not even the worst part of my experience for this game the worst part is having to run around the map looking 10 minutes for someone just to be killed because they have better equipment or more people against.Oh lord the community is a joke like an actual joke. You have people yelling in Chinese and swearing at each other and when you get killed people give you rude emotes such as tea bagging over your corpse telling you to ""git gud"". The funny part about this game is that its just recycled contents from games like DayZ Arma and H1Z1. The developer barely put any ideas of their own into this game most the stuff in game came from sources like those games I mentioned and other products which are titled ""Battle Royale"". (As in this game isn't very original and they're not the creators of battle royale since they were so enthusiastic about trash talking on Fortnite for stealing their idea when they only 'popularised' it.)Oh yeah and the crates are a grind fest to get so you're expected to play like 10 or more games to unlock 1 crate or if you're a 'roundy professional' then you'll play less than most casual players to unlock them.In conclusion this game is not fun unless you enjoy running around the entire chunk of a map just to find people to kill or be killed by some bunch of players who probably know where everything is and has the best equipped items to one tap from a miles away. The developers are a bunch of hypocrites who say they want Battle Royale to grow but on the other hand look down on games like Fortnite who are trying to do so.

Optimazation for this game can suck but even many low end pc's can run it on very low settings and still have it be playable.My biggest problem with the game is the lack of map variety.

In certain areas The game actually seems to have gotten a lot worse. Now the game has always had it's lagg Frame and Desync issues but it was never this bad I'm running a i5 4670K Processor with a GTX 1060 and my PC really struggles at times Constant frame drops and the game sometimes becomes unplayable in certain areas of the map. The game is also overrun by a big Chinese populace in every region for some reason(?) making communication almost impossible because very few of them speak English In the 6+ Hours I've played of squads and Duo's I Haven't met a single Non Chinese player in EU / American servers. It doesn't help that they have crazy amounts of ping on these servers too. I really do struggle to understand how this game has managed to sell 20 000 000 copies at $30 a piece Yet struggles to occupy a team of game developers who can fix a few bugs and optimize a game It's simply unnacceptable. Could this be the next DayZ Standalone? Don't get me wrong I like this game a lot But for 26.99 / $30.00 it's certainly not worth it and would instead reccommend playing the free version of BR Fortnite.

The developers were transparent and listened to the community all the way until Microsoft got involved. Ever since then they have had to shift focus onto console as well and it seems the quality of the game and subsequent updates have suffered because of this. Devs stopped listening to the community once they got all of our money cheating is now rampant in the game servers go down for 3+ hours every week now it seems like and the game is still very clunky.

You would think after over 300 hours of game play you would of seen it all but nope its getting way worse. (eg getting killed with one shot from a uzi with a level 2 helmet and vest on while driving a car at full speed check the kill cam and emeny is just firing random shots into the sky while spinning around).The developers apparently spend so much time on fixing the cheating problem with their fortnightly 8GB updates but it only seems to be getting worse..This game is no longer enjoyable for people who just want to jump on and have a good gaming session.I hate to say it but the game is slowly becoming as broken as battlefield1 Fix your up bluehole before its too late!!!!!!!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The fact that it's way more about survival than an itchy trigger finger gives each play a sense of nerve wracking anticipation whether it's looking for a good gun or finding an opportunity to use it. Perhaps the only problem I have with the game is that sometimes server connections feel stuttery though that's likely because this game's only been out for like three months and that will be fixed in due time. And despite it being really frustrating when you go three games or more getting killed before getting a kill it still makes you want to play again.

2017-11-05,0,0,422,True,Not Recommended,After getting 100 hours into this game I will first start with it can be fun. It really can be a thrill ride from start to finish wether you win or don't however it has gotten to the point that hackers and cheaters have basically made the game unenjoyable. At its current state and at how slow they are rolling out anti cheating I do not reccomend this game.I tried Today I uninstalled PUBG played a fog match and was doing alright top 20 with 3 kills. was hiding in a mountain shack when all of a sudden 3 shots that were aimed directly at my head hit the wall beside me. There was literally no way anyone should of known I was there let alone knew where my head was through the wall. He kept shooting the wall exactly where i was hiding whether I was moving back and forth. the guy then proceeds to run down and he throws 6 grenades all around the shack and in it. not saying the grenade part is unrealistic but idk anyone that carries that many grenades. So it the game isn't worth it anymore with all the cheating. I've been killed by headshots from Uzis over 150 meters I've been killed by people using speed hacks and I've been killed by aim bots. My time in the Battleground is over and I don't recommend anyone to get this game.

2017-08-11,0,0,130,True,Recommended,PUBG while limited in content and in need of bug and optimization fixes it's certainly entertaining and adrenaline rushing in its early access stage. I've read up on a lot of the bad things about the developers vs members of the community. But I'll keep my opinion of them separate from the game. I too dislike microtransations (though I would prefer more focus on completing the game and not defending microtransactions in this case) I also understand the upcoming microtransations are for charity and tournament winnings. I had fun playing in a squad with my friends and brother in law with us getting a two match win streak. The game isn't much different from other survival type games in its design and concept like the Dayz kind. It's the parachuting and play area system that makes PUBG intense and without matches overstaying their welcome. It keeps matches persistently progressing and players focused on surviving. I played my first three hours yesterday and today 9 hours went by like nothing. I hope there will be more options for private matches with friends and noncompetitive play just to explore and chill. I don't think creating that option would be hard for experienced developers nor harmful to PUBG's overall experience. More game modes to diversify and refresh the battle royale formula is the main thing that would make PUBG better (Also maps). I've no doubt of holding a torch to the developer's foot in keeping the game updated and fixed for full release. It's a good game with potential. I see it's ups and down and I hope it continues to grow a positive reception and not go down like most early access/survival games.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-02-06,0,0,242,False,Not Recommended,"I feel that PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS (All Caps for no particular reason) started out as a go to for a great mixture of realism teamplay and high adrenaline moments. This however slowly gets drowned out by multiple realizations about the actual game itself.Put simply the game although extraordinarily popular is unfinished. This is apparant even with multiple updates there are persistent texture and rendering bugs not that it matters because most players intentionally turn the graphic settings down in order to see players better out of an environment. The game took several months to add vaulting considering this game is based off of a mod of the ARMA engine I'm suprised it took that long. The game is rather finnicky at times the loading screen crashing is a regular occurance. The game itself is basically the ultimate battle royal style gameplay people want these days with a scavenging and survival element akin to a game like rust but without crafting. This mechanic is interesting but ultimately the cards must be in your favor for you to be guaranteed a good game. There is a lot of RNG in this game there is some skill but I'd say about 80% of this game is based on luck and 20% is based on skill. You can learn adapt and try to overcome but that won't matter if you end up with a pistol and the first circle is on the other side of the map. I like the approach but it does feel really slanted towards luck and I've witnessed and experienced nothing to the contrary. You will have many frustrating deaths. One of my biggest issues with the game is that no death really feels deserved. For instance the first killcam I watched when the feature was implemented I was in a house and I crouched to pick up an item and got picked off by a Kar98k. Typical death right? I watch the killcam and see some dude sitting on a building turn and snap right to the window I was barely in and headshotted me immediately. Clearly a cheater which is a problem I'll discuss later. Even discounting the cheating problem the gameplay is rather akward and clunky at times sometimes it feels like the person you're shooting at is sponging 7.62x39mm rounds and they turn and two tap you with an M16. The outcomes of gunfights feel mostly up to chance especially when they are drawn out for an extended period of time. The circle in my opinion cements the fact the gameplay is 80% up to chance. I say this because the circle will either save or screw you with little inbetween. Oh there happens to be a mountain on the side you're approaching from? Tough. There's a river there? Sorry. There's a bunker beneath this spot and there are enemies beneath it you can't reach due to the blue sphere of death? Unfortunate. The circle is on the other side of the map? Get better at ""adjusting to that situation"" or something. The community is possibly one of the worst I've ever seen. If you want evidence of this look at the formus. This game is like GTA Online if everyone was forced in close proximity to kill each other and the community takes this to the max. Cheating is very common even with Battleye which I believe with my coding background to be fundamentally flawed and easy to exploit. Just check Battleye's twitter in January they banned over 1 million people in that month alone. The majority of these players are from china hence why the community is begging for a region lock. The developers are hesitant to do this because of all the money they made from sales over there. The development team has highs and lows they actually engage the community to their credit but will outright ignore other issues such as the flawed Xbox One Launch. (Go to CrowbCat on Youtube and watch the Xbox One Release for PUBG). The game in my opinion shouldn't be out in it's current state the game still feels in beta and you can't help but feel the lack of polish even on the newest map. In summary I feel that PUBG is a game with a very high ceiling but it has a lot to do to repair several glaring issues that are currently frustrating many players myself included. I hope this game is successful but until I see a solution to cheating improvements in the core gameplay itself and more commitment to the community from the dev team I can't say this game is going in a positive direction.Final Rating 4.5/10Rating if my Qualms were Resolved 8.5/10",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

It sucks not being able to communicate with my team in a game that demands communication with a team but what is more irritating is getting shot by someone when you are behind a wall because on their end you were not behind a wall.Brendan Greene seems to be adamant on cracking down on cheaters (he really isn't he couldn't give a damn). He claims this while refusing to region lock which in its own way is a form of cheating. Ask many players who aren't Chinese they would agree. It is unfair. It is a massive advantage to the Chinese players.With that in mind it's fair to say that Brendan Greene is aiding Chinese players in their latency/lag benefits. If there was a way to report Brendan Greene/PLAYERUNKNOWN in the game despite him owning the game I would do it a million times. He appears to have no intention of actually making the game fair. He is a virtue signaling bloke who wreaks of hypocrisy. It is doubtful he would lose much money implimenting a region lock but still he will not do so.Yes I will still play the game for pure kicks n' giggles. But the game is cancer thanks to Brendan Greene.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-23,0,0,1797,False,Not Recommended,Over 6 months ago the developers of this game said they'd fix the game prior to a launch in September. It didn't launch until December and it still averages the same 10hz netcode (meaning it only updates your information about every 100ms or 1/10th of a second) and it gets as bad as 5hz every 200ms in the first couple minutes of the game.Anyone saying the game just needs some polish is either very misinformed or straight up lying. The netcode precludes this game from being anything other than a fun tech demo. Most of your actions won't even matter that much in the first couple minutes of the game because the netcode is so bad you'll be strafing behind the corner of a wall using it for cover and on the other person's screen your player avatar will be way out in the open because the server never registered your movement and thought you kept moving way out into the open even though on your screen you're still in cover.Just watch how innacture the kill cams are compared to what you actually saw yourself. This is still an EA game and the netcode is absolute trash. Hasn't improved AT ALL in the last 6 months. Might even have gotten worse. Developer lies on the regular.

Plays really well now death cam shows if i was actually killed by a hacker or not. It still annoys me that they started selling crates in EA and the whole crate system is just messed up but the game itself is top notch for me now. As a side note death cam did not work for me after the release but the recent small up date fixed that. It does load 30 secs for me but that could maybe be my slow internet. *** Old review***I give my negative vote for obvious reasons1. Early Access but no fixes. Buildings that don t load force me to take safe jumps always because as soon as someone is with me he will grab a weapon and kill me while I sit outside waiting for the buildings to load. (My Hardware is more than sufficient) 2. We wont sell stuff in early access Screw you guys buy our crates (Not only are crates the worst system but also this move just shows how incredible greedy the devs are even through they sold a gazillion copies. Nothing against cosmetic but keep your promises3. The whole ban thing. Haven t made the experience myself but there are a lot of rumours going on and I reckon there are reasons for them.

2017-06-23,0,0,453,True,Recommended,To start off with there is a reason people wouldnt like this game. It is the type of game where you build an arsenal for the rest of a round (average 30 minutes for top 10) not for the rest of the time you play the game. You WILL die. You WILL lose your stuff. My first 20 games I repeatedly died because I just didnt know how to play the game. There are very many different strategies and very many play tactics that just work better than others. This is the type of game that may be better to start playing with friends in the beginning so you can figure out the better strategies together. This game can be very stressful but it can also be very rewarding. My favorite part of the game is when there are about 20 people left becuases at that point the player ground is established. You are either skirting the perimeter or deep into the center of the ring camping out a building ready for the onslaught that is about to occur. Everyone has their loadout to their personal preference it is an equal playing field. But then again its never an equal playing field. Tactical advantage aka high ground advantage the guy crouching in a bush with his silenced sniper the guy in a building with his shotgun who's just waiting for you to turn the corner. You never know what to expect. Every game is a different new experience. Different drops different enemies different final locations. There is nothing more thrilling than being the final man standing. Winning. The rush you feel after having the last 30 40 minutes pay off and everything you built towards succeed is incredible but you know what is even better than that? The fact that right after that one you get to pick up a whole new round with a totally new expirience.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

See i'm not a fan of most ""survival games"" because they tend to make the game sounds or looks hardcore but fills it with a stupid mechanics such as H1Z1. PUBG makes me wanted to buy it in first place mainly because it seems legit everything seems proper comparing to H1Z1 and many other games which is obviously later on not the fact.What PUBG really screwed themselves up is that they are contradicting themselves on a big scale they added on hardcore settings and more mainstream FPS/TPS vibes and on the other hands keeps a ton of ""bad habits"" you can see and hate you get from other games. E.g. you get high damage when falling out of a car when it is still moving &lt &gt higher then the damage you output by putting a mag of .45 into a dude's naked chest or you lower or raise your weapon when the barrel is long and hit the wall or cover &lt &gt your stance does not automatically change to a better shooting position. Stuff like this happen all the time maybe they are added because bluehole want to make it ""more dynamic"" (this is stupid honestly it's like forcing combat shooting to become sports shooting) or they just don't realize the problems""Other problems come from BUGS (ha BUGS get it?) (On second thought i should kms on that joke) this is the other problems i have with ""hardcore survival"" games even if they got the system good it comes with bugs because the developers are simply unable to get rid of bugs it takes time money people blablabla sure that's why i steer away from games like this. PUBG's bug can be annoying since they made wanna be hardcore rules that tend to cause more troubles to you compare to other games. Such as your barrels might pass through other people's body so that they can melee you and you don't reg hits on them your friend's gun might point and shoot at your head from a impossible angle while you guys are driving and shooting because the motion is bugy on vehicles or you cars get stuck and blow the out of everyone on it.Servers can be awful you might get shutted out of doors or you need to punch F serval times to pick up a gun or you can't revive your friend because you leave when the gauge is 0 and you left but actually you needed to wait for a serval seconds and currently cheating is a problem it used to be asian server only but now chinese hackers are literally on every server i don't get that many frequent hacker enounters on NA comparing to AS but it is still a large number larger than a self respect game should have.Again despite all the ed up parts it is still not so bad for a friend chatting simulator although generally it comes with me or other people shouting "" ING T"" and everyone just rage quits and go play Rainbow 6 Siege or Battlefield 1 still you get to enjoy collaborating with each other especially everyone gets the part right and a plan works out. I spent 260 hours i purchased this game a month after its release and i purchased Rainbow 6 Siege upon release and being my fav game i played 600 hours you see the comparison here yet again i cut down my hours playing this game because of all the problems i mean i haven't play solo for months so if they got on a new hype train or they finally decided to go on R6S ranked grind with me i might just quit because this game honestly leaves me with no attachment to it that i feel like it doesn't worth of spend time and efforts and anything on it as soon as there are better replacements maybe Fortnite lol.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Sometines the loadingscreen disapears after a minute or two sometimes it just sticks around and i have to quit the game. But if you dont care about bugs bad servers chinese hackers or bad developers the game is really fun and tense if you get to top five.

2018-03-31,0,0,312,False,Not Recommended,I would really like to recommend this game because I think it is actually a really good game but I can't.Let me explain.... when it first came out it was a fairly unique game and showed some real promise the concept was great the graphics were really good and the game play and physics were good it was an all round great game and I really enjoyed playing it. However very quickly the cheats and hackers moved in and regardless of what the developers may say they are still here.Gradually over time this problem has got worse and worse single kill headshots are very common now there are videos on youtube which actually show someone getting a headshot while the target is completely hidden behind a rock and others are blatantly showing off their hacks.It is also confusing how you can be lying in the long grass behind a tree and take one shot at someone running in the open about 500 / 600 meters away with a silenced sniper rifle with an 8 x scope and that player instantly turns round tilts their head to one side and put a round straight into you before you have had time to fire a second round! I don t care how good you are but you cannot locate the direction of a shot that fast let alone get a perfect shot off.Another issue is the death cam either this shows just how many people are hacking (no one ever seems to be aiming or even anywhere near you when they kill you) or the death cam itself is so poor its useless and may as well not be there.(I would like to mention at this point that there are some really excellent players on this game who you may expect are cheating but they are not they are just really good but as you like me are not in their league you should never be matched with them unless the matching system is also flawed and useless).There are various glitches like invisible rocks that stop your car in its tracks (and remove some of your health) disappearing hedges and floating objects although this sort of thing is to be expected in any game these days.At the end of all this you reward for dedication and perseverance . A crate which you either have to pay real money to open or get a t shirt you already have ... pointless! Although there do seem to be an awful lot of idiots out there spending a lot of money on in game clothing.So over all this is why I can t recommend it because if I did you may spend good money on it and as you would be new and inexperienced you are likely to get wiped out very quickly and then the monotony of jumping landing looting running from the blue line then getting killed by an impossible head shot will soon hit you and you will regret buying it.There are now many other games like this one out there although I have not bought them as I am afraid they will be much the same but check out their review and maybe give one of them a try instead.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-23,0,0,71,False,Not Recommended,Review This game is fun sometimes when you get to face people alot but most of the time it is just running/driving around 10min without seeing anyone and when you do see one you get killed from behind by a sniper that sat in a building pretty frustrating.If that where the only problem with the game it would have been fine but there is so much more. This game just got released from early access and the servers are the worst i have played on you skydive/parachute down and when you touch the ground you start running and you teleport back(rubberband effect) every game..... there is no server that dont have these kind of problems.......You get the rubberband effect everytime and then you die because you have been trying for the last 30sec getting around the corner and you just get teleported back......I mean you realesed this game out of early access and the game isnt half finished..... Pros Alot of weapons Pretty good hit reg based on the thrashy servers they got Cons Super bad servers i could host a better server on my computer (ironic) Really clunky movements not realistic at all. To many campers especially on the new map because if you run/drive on a field you get shot in the city you get shot you get shot wherever you go. You can loot a whole apartment and if you are really lucky maybe find a ump then you go into a small cabin and get overwhelmed by stuff level 3 helm back vest and a Scar L and Kark98k. There is no such thing as balanced loots in pubg,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-12-23,0,0,438,False,Not Recommended,Maybe when the devs get their heads out of their ill recommend the game again. They cared more about xbox over pc that the game has done nothing but run like The bugs are beyond horrible in the game you can shoot a guy in the head 6 times with a level two helmet and he will kill you in 2 shot while you have a level 3. They nerf weapons they shouldn't and not having a map selection is garbage. I am glad to have a new map and all but i still like playing the original too. The new map has been shoved down my throat so much that i'm tired of it. This patch ran much better on the test server than on the actual game itself. China flooding the North America server is also getting annoying because you cant even find a 4th player without getting stuck with someone who doesn't speak english but talks to you as if you have any idea what he is saying. I use to love this game and it is my top played game but The creators have pretty much shifted most attention to their garbage xbox version instead of the people who have been there from the beggining. You also completely ruined the m16. It's dumb you can put an 8x on everything else but that. Also made no changes to the 4 times which is garbage the test server for this patch had the 4x everyone was liking yet you guys just kept the old one.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Danger can come from anywhere at anytime and your hands will shake your heart will race and your killer instinct will take hold as you fight to survive. In those last moments when the circle is tight and there are only a few men standing miraculous things can happen that will become lasting memories.

It's you vs. the world after all. )Suspensful semi slow gameplay with realistic yet fun gun mechanics. Land loot be the last one to survive. Action is typically short and far in between but when it happens it's usually a adrenaline rush.Not the best looking game out there but it farily well optimized now compared to the early acess.The sound is also well done. Listen closely and you'll hear your foe's footsteps or gunshot beyond the hill.I personally really enjoy pubg however there is a few things that can make or break this game for you you will VERY RARELY win so if you're a sore looser who tosses your mouse across the room because you died... you should probably sit this one out.Sometimes you'll be taken out of the game in a single shot and you have no idea form where which can feel like you got cheated which can suck but keep in mind that you're going to switch places and kill someone that's completely unaware of you at multiple points too.

This game's 90% nothing happening. I hear that time is tense for other people but I was just booooooored.The combat isn't even that great once you finally get to it. Network code is unoptimized animations are weak player movement is unrealistic and janky. Lowering your graphic settings gives you a huge advantage by removing grass/shrubs and making the enemies stand way out. No cover system. Mechanics that heavily favor campers and luck with a deadly blue forcefield that shrinks on a random point as the game progresses. Don't forget plenty of hackers.And yet insanely popular.

2017-10-14,0,0,127,True,Not Recommended,"""Optimization what's optimization?"" Playerunknown 2017Needless to say this game is extremely fun and addicting and is even better with friends. I think the 2 million player count proves that. Before you buy this game though there are a couple things you should know.This game runs worse than a cripple in a marathon. I've had some seriously fun moments with this game don't get me wrong. But it seems like half the time i'm grinding my teeth together waiting for the stuttering to stop. I know i have a potato PC but it meets the minimum requirements by more than enough. Minimum requirements should mean ""This game will run smoothly on low very low settings"" not ""This game will run like a penguin flies on extremely low settings"". Usually the first couple minutes after i land consist of extreme stuttering usually to the point of unplayable and me waiting for the buildings to load in. While it does only last a few minutes this can give you an extreme disadvantage. Once the lagging stops and i can actually loot things i still only get 25 30 fps average. I know it's still in early access and it's still being exponentially worked on. But seriously we're getting a new map soon and a lot of content updates have already dropped. Should not making your game actually somewhat playable come before more content?This game has a lot of potential it really does. But i hope more than anything this doesn't get stuck in the infamous ""Eternal Early Access"" that a lot of games do. I wouldn't reccommend getting this game until it is much better optimized. Right now i look at the graphics and go ""Wow this game really should run a whole lot better."" If you have a PC that has at least an SSD you can put the game on and 16+ gb of RAM with a fairly beefy cpu and gpu this game shouldn't be a problem for you. But if you're anything like me and would have to rob a bank to get that kind of setup save your money and your time and don't buy this game unless you want to put up with more lag than you would have playing GTA V on a TI 36x.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-11-06,0,0,472,True,Not Recommended,As of me typing this it's probably been a month since I've last played. I seldomly ran into hackers so I can't complain about that. In the beginning the game was new and fun and I pushed aside the dumb things I encountered (which are still around to this day) because it's in early access/beta. That's where the problem is though....the problems are still here. Most notably desync and graphics optimization. All games suffer from desync because latency between your computer and their servers but developers have found ways to make it *feel* seamless. However in PUBG there are lots of noticeable moments where desync happens and it can be infuriating. As far as gfx optimization I feel like it won't ever be fixed because they have the environment generate within a certain distance of your character. No matter what gfx quality you have set after 100m or so the foliage disappears and you just have a flat surface. You no longer have cover from crouching in a bush or being prone in grass. Most people play at the lowest gfx quality which really says a lot when it comes to video games like this when you sacrifice gfx quality (which looks great on ultra) for gameplay quality.Looking at the recent reviews it's looking grim for PUBG before their official 1.0 release on PC and XBox. They've announced they're working on resolving the cheating/hacking issue (which was apparently rampant) and even that can only go so far. Hackers/cheaters will always find a way to do so in a PC game just look at Counter Strike. I'm really hoping they can resolve these issues before their 1 year mark on Steam but at this point I can't recommend this game. I would wait until Bluehole gets their shiz together.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-04-28,0,0,350,True,Recommended,I played a ton of ARMA 2 which included Taki Life and lots of the Dayz mod. I have also put many a hour into Arma 3. When H1Z1 and H1Z1 KOTH released I stayed faraway from those games. From playing this game I can confidently reccomend it as someone who largely enjoys tactical style shooters. One of the devs from Dayz mod and H1Z1 worked on this game and the Arma style gameplay is clearly present. Although movement is not overly clunky and firefights are generally viceral.Bullet drop is present in the game along with decently implented damage modeling. Recoil is well done and manageble but. Driving physics is relatively well done and the map itself looks nice building design is also quite fluid. Some bugs are present but many have been already ironed out and the game is relatively optimized. My only complaints would be badly placed because I know most issues will probably be fixed and the game seems to have less bugs than Arma 3. I would say that maybe sometimes weapons are much too plentiful and that maybe the game could benifit from less high level weapon and gear spawns. But then again sometimes gearing out a squad of 4 can take a while. I would say that the game could do with more punishing headshot damage for squad gameplay because even when headshot by a high powered rifle teamates can be picked up. It would be nice if headshots from high powered rifles actually straight up killed to make long distance shooting feel more rewarding. I can fully reccomend the game even in early access and say its a blast with friends solo gameplay is not bad either. Although some points of the game are slow to pick up firefights when only 15/100 are left can be very intense. A must buy for anyone who enjoys rewarding shooting mechanics and an emphasis on team coordination.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

As for example the border system is very unfair and does not give you any type of chance. Also there are many bugs and glitches that make the game literally unplayable. Also the desert map is very bad and the developer should add the option to choose between the two maps as i sometimes end up just quitting the match because of how bad it is.

2018-03-30,0,0,915,False,Not Recommended,"600 hours in my TLDR The Battle Royale genre is satisfying addictive and unique but PUBG executes it poorly due to being so unstable. As soon as a competitor enters I believe the playerbase will migrate. PUBG has seen huge success as a result of being first to market with the BR genre. However in their short period of success they have thus far been unable to capitalise on their monopoly of the market to create long term loyal players. They have created a huge audience keen to sink their teeth into a well made BR game but not necessarily *their* game. My current prediction is that in the near future better suited or better resourced studios will release better polished BR games at the large expense of PUBG. One of the primary faults of PUBG is devs either do not recognise problems publically or outright ignore or disagree with them. Their staunch indifference to Western audiences pleading to limit Chinese players who negatively impact experience (lag hacking communication difficulty) has been impacting the game for the worse. The game has not shaken off its Alpha status with ridiculous bugs that continue to plague it. The graphics are passable but are ultimately clunky. Server issues and hit registry can be abysmal. The game lobby feels like something from 2001 and the fact there is a ""restart lobby"" button really only substantiates this. And yet we're all still here playing PUBG. My strong belief is this is a testament to the BR genre not to PUBG as a game.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Hey im not sporting a nasa god tier machine mind you. i5 gtx1060 16g ram not bad. But as soon as a press that little cursed icon sitting at the bottom of my dashboard with PUBG in big yellow letters my frames drop to the point where it looks like im watching a ing slideshow. its as if i went into a deep web chat room with malwarebytes disabled and said my up fam dont get me wrong this game is fun with friends hell some of the best times ive had with my buds were just the four of us ing around in a UAZ with the windows down blasting miley cyrus like its a ing owen wilson movie. but the time where my dumbass went into a solo diving into polyana and get immediately shot like im waving around a $5 panera bread gift card in the middle of compton bc the goddamn houses wont load was one of the many games where i sat back in my chair and just said to myself was this pre release game really worth $30? no the answer is a fat no. im well aware that the building model loading issue might be a hdd issue but ive looked into it and my formatting is completely spotless if i need to take the damn thing out of my pc and throw it in the dishwasher to clean it then i will. ill be damned if i have to pay upwards of a Benjamin for an ssd to load a ty blender model polygon house only to loot a crowbar and some pants. the hit reg and hitboxes are worse than rainbow six during operation health. i would like to get some hitpoints when i shoot someone from clitlicking distance while standing completely still with a shotgun more beefy than terry cruz. OH and the command registration issues good christ where do i start. ill give you a rundown on how computers/games/slaves in the 1800s work. if you give them a &lt command&gt then they usually &lt obey&gt . pubgs game script gives a colossal middle finger to that logic and completely ignores my mouse1 inputs. it would be real nice if the game could just shoot my gun when i tell it to like a normal game but nah that requires effort and money they need that for their NEW AND REVOLUTIONARY VAULTING MECHANIC THAT IS TAKING ACTUAL years to be released. the RNG factor is nearly laughable. the games fairness is completely ruined from the busted er i mean realistic drop rates. your only chances of surviving rely on weather or not your pc is better at registering bullets than the guy your shooting at and if you can survive an asschewing at po i for a level 2 vest and a redbull. so essentially your success depends on if you have a i9 with quad titanx all liquid cooled by alien blood. the gun balancing is SO much better now than about a month ago however its still tremendously suicide worthy. why have a kar98 when you have a trusty double barrel with a choke on it. why is it whenever i shoot at someone with a shotty its like i slapped them in the face with a napkin from a little kids birthday party but when i get kin flashed its like some big brollic black dude named in requis put a bedsheet over my head and proceeds to skull me.

Physics engine could be better when driving cars. Less bugs An anti cheat system that can detect programs or at least player skill dramatically increased in a course of a game.

2018-03-19,0,0,250,False,Not Recommended,I can't really recommend it too much as it was fun in the begininng but absolutely terrible now.First is the Optimisation. When I bought the game for 40 bucks CAD way back last summer... I enjoyed it becuase it was action packed with very little BS in it but I can't say the same now. The Optimisation for lower end rigs are trash now and you can't get consistent frame rates. I can run it at 100 frames a second but when I load in a new part it goes way down to 20. When I drive my game can't handle it and don't get me started with the loading.... BlueHole is just a greedy money machine now adding lootboxes and making a console port and focusing on that instead of fixing the broken PC game first. It isn't just me either. I have frinds with medium to high end rigs that come into many problems. Next you feel EVERY GAME has a hacker of some sort and you can't control it. The devs make no contributions becuase filthy rich chinese just buy or pirate copies and copies of this game just to enjoy destroying people by hacking the game to their benefit. You can find all kinds of hacks such as Wall hacks Aimbot hacks Stretchy Arm hacks and so many more. I know why Blue Hole doesn't fix this issue... more money for them! Think about it... once they do get banned (rare) they just buy a new copy for 40 bucks. With their supposed 'thousands of hackers banned' then they get thousands of copies more!Overall you choose if this game fits you needs. If you have a beast of a PC and don't mind hackers too much than go ahead but otherwise I strongly do not recommend this game and recommend you use your money on something else....,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Bluehole fixed some issues and created more but nonetheless were always working on the game. But over the course of the last few months the game has become infested with hackers and cheaters. Almost every game has some sort of cheater and not only that the game is still filled with bugs. Its ok during early access to have issues but not in the full game.

2017-11-22,0,0,603,True,Not Recommended,This game is a buggy mess of bad code cheats and a resource hog that can himper even the strongest PCs out there. That said is it fun? Yes. It's a somewhat unique gameplay coupled with some randomness and PvP competition. It can be addicting and when you get over all the bad stuff it's a great game.Edit One month from launch and the game still barely works. This is simply put a scam. It uses one monetisation trick after the other to try and extract most money out of people while being incredibly incompetent on the technical level. The only thing this game has going for it is that it's somewhat unique in it's genre but after the whole press this game got a lot of competent studios are developing better games than this crap. I recommend Fortnite for anyone who appreciates games made by people who can actually write code like grownups.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Don't speak any other language but Chinese (however they can tell you to your mother) which doesn't allow for proper communication with your team. You will be outnumbered in your squad if you are an English/French speaker. 2.) Have horrible ping and make everyone else lag.3.) Since a 5% share of the business is given to a Chinese company that also sells hacks within China Bluehole is essentially encouraging Chinese players to hack. I have yet to come across an EU or NA player to hack the game within the 200+ hours I spent on this game. Until Bluehole stops allowing hacks or puts a ping lock so that the servers can become stable again (while also still allowing me and my friends to squad up with other English speaking players) I can't recommend this game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-06-14,0,0,367,True,Recommended,"You know what you're getting into with this sort of game. It's a standalone Early Access Battle Royale/King Of The Hill/Last Stand game (how many of these things are there anyways?) designed by the guy who popularized (certainly not created though) the genre in modern gaming. There are many games like this I've played practically all of them (and you can PM me for free keys to some of the now dead ones that literally nobody plays now) and this is without a doubt one of the current best ones on the market. The price is definitely higher than most similar games but I personally believe that the level of quality and content that you get from this EARLY ACCESS BATTLE ROYALE game is so much more worth it than the dozens of others out there. The one current level is huge with loads of actual usable nooks and crannies throughout the entire map that feel almost natural to the landscape yet perfectly reasonable in a gameplay manner. Obviously you should be playing fairly conservatively by exercising caution moving slowly checking corners and windows and steadily upgrading your arsenal otherwise you'll be wondering why yet another 13 year old Russian kid sniped you in the middle of an open field and teabagged your corpse. The map design supports this with diverse and well thought out layouts for cities that involve multiple levels rickety man made bridges and easy to remember general areas where the more powerful weapons and gear spawn.I see plenty of people complaining about what currently constitutes of the Meta of this game claiming that small bugs and such cause game breaking bugs that ABSOLUTELY make the AK47 a BROKEN gun. I currently have 12 (which at the time I'm writing this review is around the top 20% of players) ingame hours I'm in the Final 10 practically 90% of the time I play. I've been murdered by screaming Twitchtv streamers and told to check out their stream for a replay of my death. I've made it to the top 3 players and been killed by what was apparently a 12 year old with an Xbox Live mic driving a Jeep in circles. I went on a 6 player killstreak using only the ACP1911 with a supressor then blew myself up trying to do a backflip. There's so much crazy and just plain exciting things happening in this game that every time I come away from it I'm thinking back ""Holy that badass"" about some teamwork me and a friend pulled off to clutch our first Duo victory.PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS is just a damn fun game.

I run a 300mbps asynchronous connection. This game on it's best settings was pulling around 25 33 fps. Pathetic. The lag made the game unplayable. I tried on two different days as a fair test same thing. There is also another game free to play game just like this but it is just as laggy.UPDATE A few months later after around 2 dozen of my friends bought the game and kept bugging me to buy it again and give it a try I did. I re purchased it. It took a few of my friends and I to go back and forth (online) with settings and different variables that was causing my previously stated lag. For example it would take 7 10 seconds to open the backpack (inventory) which is crucial to have it opened quickly as looting quickly means life or death. My entire problem was my overkill system. I took out 2 of my 980s and left a single one in. It was the SLI. Game runs fine and what appeared 100% identical to bad lag was doodoo rendering. Now this game is fun.

Chinese players who don't speak english often hack or are there to just mess with you are all too common. I ONLY play Duo or Squads with my friends which is disappointing when they aren't on because playing this game with others is without a doubt the best way to do it.The lag can be ridiculous.

More excitement came when i saw a 5GB update The ""Performance Patch"" but as soon as i loaded into a game i felt a severe drop in my FPS. I went from 30 50 FPS to a solid 9 FPS no matter where i went and not to mention the sound bug from the red zone still hadn't been fixed.

2018-02-11,0,0,252,False,Not Recommended,I want to love this game. I really wanted this game to continue to do well but at this point I don't know if it worth saving. The game seems to give benefit to players that have high ping. Whether or not Chinese players are cheating is a different story to whether or not they get an advantage simply because this game gives advantage to people that have a higher ping(It does).It is becoming a trend for me and my team. Early nights start off well we can get some sweet chicken dinners sometimes more than one a night. Everything feels fair and I even get to sometimes have some funny and even civilized discussions with other players in global chat.But as the night goes on and it reaches the 1am 2am CST time frame my lobby becomes crowded with people screaming in Chinese over global chat suspicious kills (no line of sight faster than normal movement locking onto my head no recoil and shooting through cover) and a general drop in personal game play performance. At this point between the test server and the game I have played nearly 200 hours the longest of any game in my Steam library but I don't think I can do it anymore.I have played games like Fortnite and although I am not good at it and it isn't as enjoyable to me as this game is it just doesn't have nearly the same amount of problems that this game has which is probably one reason it has surpassed PUBG in concurrent players. The biggest point to this paragraph is that Fortnite is built in the same engine so engine code isn't the issue.There is also information showing that a large amount of game information is calculated client side which just doesn't make sense and will be a total mess to fix in the future and it will HAVE to be fixed at some point if they want to be able to stop people from cheating like they are now.With that I feel like anyone that has somehow managed to not purchase this game may find it beneficial to wait until a larger more competant developer comes forward(DICE/EA UBISOFT CRYTEK etc) to create a game that is developed the way a large multiplayer game should be developed.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-25,0,0,307,False,Not Recommended,"Played this game since Early access I gave this game a positive review at first becasue the game was amazing with great potentials. But then PUBG was sold for 10M copies and developers gradually stopped giving a damn about the current condition of the game. So now I change it to negative review.First of all the servers are laggy. Still after the release sold 10M copies and servers can't handle a match It's a shame.Secondly hackers or let's say you can use reshader to get magnification It's so easy to cheat that even some twitchers got caught and banned for cheating and it was due to some other obvious mistakes they had made they didnt know how to hide it properly from viewers. You can use macro to eliminate the recoil in weapons and easily spam bullets and kill people. ""Report"" has no solved anything.So yes if you're planning to buy this game don't do it cause developers have not given this game a single sale even and there's no obvious fix in the game as well.And they say It's ""ESL ready"" ""Out of Early Access""!4/10",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

And i am VERY VERYYYYY disappointed. It is still crashing not loading (bad module shi*). I mean common with all that waiting time and the huge amount of money they made is it still not possible to have a stable game? I'm at that point where i'm thinking of uninstalling it and switch to something else. Even if the game concept is great and really funny i think it is a shame wha concerns the performance of the game. I would clearly recommand the game for the gameplay but i would never recommend it for it's performance. It is a shame!!!! Almost a rip off. 20 million players many updates and patches on the main game as on the test server game AND STILL NO STABILITY??!! SERIOUSLY??? The developpers should stay in the gaming world and never ever get involved in the car industry or other safety relevant industry otherwise they will have many death on their counsiousness.

2017-12-23,0,0,147,False,Recommended,Im really unsure how to rate this game but I'll recommend it since I believe my 100+ hours of playtime paid off the games cost.This game can be insanely fun but also insanely frustrating. Sometimes I found myself playing for hours and sometimes I would quit after just one match. Dont get me wrong this game is insanely fun if you play DUO/SQUAD but if you play SOLO all the time It will eventually get stale and you'll probably end up quitting after getting killed in the top 10's from God knows where over and over again. If you play DUO/SQUAD pre made with your friends then yeah this game is great! Lots of tactics and strategy can be done if your communitcation can be done but there will always be frustration.Its nice they added a new map new weapons vaulting etc. because it really adds to the game and vaulting brings overall smoothness to moving around cities and buildings. However even though game is offcially out of Early Access there are still issues that need to be fixed ASAP.ASIAN and OC servers are infested with hackers and ping and region lock needs to be added ASAP! The game has been optimized and runs way better than before but it optimization could still be better they should work on that a bit more as well.Overall I'd give this game a solid 7/10. Its worth getting if you want some solo adrenaline action or if you have a friend or a squad to play with.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-04-16,0,0,199,False,Not Recommended,I have been so patient with this game and I've gotten to the point where I'm just done with it. It's an unoptimized mess thats just more irratiting and frustrating than it is enjoyable. The updates they put out are very inconsistent as far as performance. After every one ive been through it will cause my computer to chug or just straight crash and then after they've worked on the current patch it will be back to the way it's supposed to perform but then shortly after they add another patch and then the cycle repeats. I have a pretty strong gaming rig too where i can play very demanding games on the max settings and have no issues at all. I can get down to as low as 20 frames on this game and have it screw my pc to the point where my whole system is in operable and have to do a hard reset. This game had a lot of potential but the devs are just inexperienced and i can't stand this repeating issue with the game anymore. Which makes me sad cause when this game works it's alot of fun and i have a great time with but unfortunately it causes more problems than enjoyment. With a heavy heart i can't recommend this and i hope they get their S*** together.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-02,0,0,177,True,Recommended,I really didn't expect to enjoy PUBG nearly as much as I did. I hadn't played H1Z1 DayZ Arma or anything in that similar vein prior to picking this game up.It took probably 45 minutes before I was hooked. There's something compelling about the constant tension that PUBG throws at you. Your head has to be on a swivel looking for and identifying threats. Your ears are focused on picking up the slightest sounds of footsteps suppressed shots or engine noise.You get to know the terrain very quickly and it slowly becomes familiar. You start to recognize which areas have better loots which areas tend to be filled with more fighting and how to leverage natural terrain for cover and movement.PUBG is a good game. Great even despite the bugs and kinks that come with an Early Access game. The devs are actively working on and fixing issues as well the last patch vastly improved FPS performance and optimized the graphics.Highly recommend anyone interested in shooters to pick this game up.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-02-04,0,0,305,False,Not Recommended,I love this game. I really do. I still continue to play it even though I don't recommend it for those who haven't played it.This game is hardcore. It's competetive. If you want a casual friendly experience with Battle Royale go play Fortnight. You can and will get salty if you die to a camper or someone who snuck up behind you but that's not the real issue with this game. The biggest issues with this game are the cheaters and the Chinese players on the other side of the world whose ping is consistently 200+ ms on the NA Servers with no region locking planned for PUBG. The latter issue is made worse by the fact that Battle Eye checked and confirmed that over 90% of the cheaters and hackers are coming from China which PUBG Corp. has no intention of region locking.In other words you have cheaters and hackers that can see and shoot you from behind walls 800 yards out with nothing but headshots landing and even if you could see them to shoot back before they kill you their ping will keep them alive just long enough to one shot you with a Kar98k. And to re iterate PUBG has *NO* intention of region locking *ANYONE*.Yes the game has decent mechanics that are fun and rewarding if you can win. Yes the game is actively being developed on. Yes this game has plenty of potential to take Battle Royale to the next level again.No I do not recommend this game.

It's early access with bugs and lag galore but the core gameplay makes it awesome.HOWEVERA game is not just a magical fairy that exists in a vacuum. A game is made by a company and the people you play it with. The people playing and making this game make it very hard to play. You can get banned for cheating or stream sniping without doing it while those who do get off scot free. If you have a teamkiller on your team you literally have to let him kill you without fighting back or you can get banned.Of course you argue any multiplayer game has it's share of jerks. Very true. But the company that made this game... that's why I can't recommend it. I can't recommend this or any game this company may make. Their policies on fair play are sadistic uncaring and biased. They mislead their players. They have wild success and then make paid skins (on RNG not just buying what you want) before they even fix huge bugs. They let other 'copycats' go by without a word (and let's face it this game is a copycat too H1Z1 anyone?) but then throw a hissy fit when Unreal Games makes a good competitor because that's their game engine maker. The list goes on and on. It just makes it hard to enjoy a game when the company making it doesn't care about your ongoing experience and focuses on such crappy stuff. I'm sorry Bluehole but it would help me if you'd just step back take a deep breath fix some core gameplay before you try to sell me more stuff and for crying out loud... do something productive.

2017-12-03,0,0,132,True,Not Recommended,My friends and I play alot of this game and other shooters like R6 siege. This game is getting worse seems like every other game some guy is aim botting. Still choppy performance. Game is mediocre at the moment and hopelessly frustrating when your whole squad gets headshotted by one guy in 45 seconds. ....let them fix the hacking issue before you buy.On a real note Fortnite runs better on more machines and doesnt have the issues with hacking. While I like the realism and focus of PUBG the issues of hacking and choppiness are making me put it on hold. I'm personally moving to Fortnite for the moment as it runs better on my machine is a similar arena survival game and doesnt have aimbotters every match. Funny thing is Fortnite is free and better atm despite all the money we alpha supporters have poured into this game. DONT worry tho they are doing an XBOX port with our money before fixing game breaking issues. Take my advice go play the Free fortnite before placing stock in this game. They have enough of our money and need to deliver before more is tanked.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-04-03,0,0,120,True,Recommended,Playerunknown's Battlegrounds The best survival of the fittest out there. Before I start my review on this amazing game as of writing this review I have played 60.9 hours and plan to play many more. This is by far my favorite STEAM game out there. There is ALMOST no bugs except for one that has bothered me since the beginning of when I started playing which I will get into when I list the Pros/Cons which shall be right now. Pros Great game to play with friends or alone and for me at least is different everytime making it enjoyable. Fun and competitive at the same time! You don't always have to win to feel good. Updated often for how the game is with maps to come in the future. Comes with the test servers which you can try new weapons before they come out in the finished project. 3rd Person and 1st Person! Not only is there both but there is now a new only first person mode which is the perfect level of challenging and fun. Many different weapons to kill your foes with and many more to come! There is so many other pros to list but I think you get it the game is great! But now for the cons. Cons May require good computer to run with good FPS and decent graphics make sure your computer can run it well. One game breaking glitch that has happened twice to me which is my wins aren't counting let me explain. So I mainly only play solo and I have won twice yet my wins still aren't counted for what I know not many have experienced this glitch so you should be fine. PS I will remove this con if it gets fixed next time I win. Even with the two cons this is such a great game and I can say hands down is my favorite game on STEAM and is an easy 10/10. I HIGHLY suggest you get this game if you can run it. If you have any questions I might be able to answer them so just message me. Just get it there will be no regrets.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-10-14,0,0,1080,True,Recommended,I keep encountering lots of hackers with aim bots. Love the game but there needs to be a preventative way for hackers to not be able to join. I've also been noticing a lot of FPS drop when near any of the bombing zones(red zones). This makes it extremely difficult to play especially during a fire fight. 10/10 recommend but these issues need to be fixed.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

You can bunker up luring enemies into your traps and scream of joy when you actually succeed. You can camp out far away from the flightpath gear up and return with a storm or sneak your way deeper into no mans land.It was quite the happy surprise to load this up for the first time since I did not expect much it has ways to go but the potential here is great.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-20,0,0,901,True,Recommended,After many many hours of playing this game on a laptop that it shouldn't run it very well ( Actually I play at 40 50 fps sometimes 35 ) I can definetly say that a lot of things that people complain about are not totally real. There is some rubberbanding? Yes Cheaters? Yes but unless you're really unlucky you will find 1 or 2 cheaters for every 20 30 games.One of the best things about this game is bullet register I have like 700 hours in this game and never had problems with it if blood appears damage have been done. Maybe sometimes it would look like that we hit the chest but we did hit a leg but w/e. It has some bugs and crashes and can be optimized a little bit more but if I can run a game like this in a lap top with an i5 6200 at 2Ghz 8 gb of DDR4 RAM and a nvidia 920mx with 2 gb of vram is definetly optimized enough.This game is very rewarding and frustrating at the same time there will be days about being in the top 10 the entire day and other days you wont even survive the first circle. But if you manage to not tilt and keep playing you'll end up having fun even more if you play with friends on Duo or Squad.Definetly a good game for the price it has.Super recommended.PD If you have a super good computer you'll love the game even more though.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Even though it's still in early access beta phase its a million times better than H1Z1 and other BR games. &gt &gt &gt PROS Fun to play both alone and with friends. Solo/Duo/Squad(3 4players 5 to be added soon) game modes. Dev team seems to actually care about the game pushing patches every week. Enough content even on this early phase. Weapon customisation is OP. Hit reg is fine ish. VECHICLES &lt 3 Balanced gameplay. No pay to win system at all.&gt &gt &gt CONS Optimisation is super bad. Can struggle even on High end PCs. Opening Inventory can freeze the game for 10 20 seconds. Video memory leaks. It's hard to get the right settings cause the game can run better on higher graphic settings. Some bugs could be still annoying (Like getting killed by a headshot in mid air lol) Even though I mentioned that the game has enough content I'm still looking forward for more weapons/vechicles/maps.&gt &gt &gt Conclusion Read ""CONS"" first consider if you want to play it even with these things but keep in mind that the dev team truly cares about feedbacks and they are trying to fix bugs and improve optimisation ASAP. I'd recommend this game to everyone after all the thrill of the hunt the tense actions and sneaky beaky ambushes will make you forget about the cons the game have.

Ok onto the review shall we.THE GOOD Two nice maps to get to mix things up with and a third smaller map on the way which is very cool. Fornite only has the one map and gets stale quick for me.Lots of customization while on the ground lots of weapons to choose from and really make it your playstyle while in the battle.Has a test and Experimental Server for trying out their new patches and changes before release which is very cool and can be fun at times. especially when main server goes down I do like the ""realistic"" bullet drop with guns which makes the learning curve a little steeeper and rewarding once mastered.now.... onto my complains and really what broke the game for me.THE BAD Really what breaks this game for me is the POOR i reapeate POOOORR OPTIMIZATION of the Game. I have died more times due to the game then anything else. It stutters when picking up items it sometimes wont reload guns if u accidently take a step forward at the wrong time thus resulting in dying in the beginning. The chute gets stuck between two buildings and wont let you drop but 10 seconds later once the ""cut chute"" pops up. The driving mechanics are just horrible. sometimes it is predictible and others u dont know what just happened to the car. The frames drop by a good 30 at random times and i have a GTX 1080 TI. also the game caps you at 144 which is silly and dumb. The community is not the best ill just say that.The developers have spent most of their time ""fixing"" things that have been addressed year ago and still havent fully fixed it.RNG loot crates should have not been introduced until the game was well optimized.Seems to run on very bad servers alwasys once or twice per game you will get a huge lag spike and often at the worst ing times. Overall I really wanted to like this game becasue it CAN be fun at times however most of the time its an unpredictible storm of lag and t hit detection that will drive any veteran shooter insane. They refuse to spend the time optimizing the game and the community has finally come to realize how little they care thus leaving this game.

There's no other way to put it but to say that hackers have sucked the fun out of this game and I promise you if you buy this game you will lose to a hacker 6 times out of 10. Also Bluehole has put off and ignored everyone's complaints on the forums and they're dealing with the hacking issue with no sense of urgency it's pitiful.

2017-12-05,0,0,55,True,Recommended,Fantastic gameplay. Probably the best iteration of the battle royale genre. This one is worth $30 due its strong core gameplay and promising future.PROS Mods/attachments for guns different levels of armor and cool clothes that can potentially act as camo add a nice layer to the loot mechanic The varying weather vehicles and soon to be new map make you utilize the environment in new ways each game Gunplay is great with degrees of skill that involve situational awareness as well as aiming. Separated modes for first person and third/first combined is nice as well as duos/squads. Game will likely have a ton of support going forward due to its popularity.CONS Despite being near its official release optimization is still an issue. My friend and I have both had a crash each in ten hours as well as consistent frame drops. For the most part I'm hitting 60 FPS with a 1080 graphics card though. Vehicle control feels a bit wonky Hacking seems to be a growing issue from what others have said. I personally haven't been impacted by it.RECOMMENDATIONS More ways to feel progression such as a leveling system more generous loot etc.Overall the pros heavily outweigh the cons. Most of the negatives of this game can be fixed. The gameplay itself is extremely fresh and fun. If you like shooters at all buy this game and play with your friends and you won't regret it.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-02,0,0,855,False,Not Recommended,"I bought this game end of October and I was quite impressed with it. But after playing it for 500 hours it's somewhat important to write a follow up after getting some experience. So here's my first early access review ""After playing this game for over 80 hours I can say it's quite infectious and addictive. The game is flawed the optimization is awful and BattlEye cheat detection isn't perfect but overall it's a game with an original idea and is worth playing and is worth your 30 dollars.""And today end of February I can say that there is more bs from devs more cheaters and less useful updates. We're getting useless cases nobody asked for like the Militia and Fever crates. Why aren't we getting more bans. A few days ago I got teamkilled by a Chinese guy because I had a supressed AWM. I check his op.gg and even after my report he's still playing like nothing happened. Also a guy fires 20 bullets at me with a SCAR L from over 200 meters with a 4x and even after my cheating report he's still playing. Why aren't you doing anything about the reports Bluehole?Where's our region lock so we can block out players that have a desync and high ping advantage?

2017-06-10,0,0,142,True,Recommended,I honestly have a neutral opinion on the game due to issues with frame rate and visibility and sacrificing one for the other. Unless you've got a beast of a PC either you set everything lower to get good frame rates but hinder yourself from seeing other players from afar or bump up your settings to get good visibility and get absolutely bad frame rates. This doesn't make the game unplayable though it just puts you at a disadvantage against other players with beefed up PCs.The game REALLY needs optimization hopefully in the next update. Neverthless the gameplay is very fun and even better with friends.

2017-12-20,0,0,108,True,Recommended,I do not really understand all the negativity around this game unless it's about hackers. I get that some people have problems with bugs and I do too trust me. But to say that the developers do not know what they are doing is IMO a joke. This game has been in early access for less than a year and they are set on releasing the full 1.0 version tomorrow. This is still impressive and a breath of fresh air when compared to other Early Access games. (day z for example.) They have improved the stability and performance a lot since the release and in my opinion the game is very much playable even on the test servers except the rubber banding. For me personaly I have not encountered a single person hacking in this game yet. I don't know if I am lucky or not but I guess this problem is more apparent on the US and the Asian servers and not the EU. I think the team has made great progress so far. When the game hit 1.0 tomorrow the team will most likley adress all the stability issues that we may encounter and not focus on new content. Early access is just not a funding campain. It's more aimed at getting the minimal viable product to the hands of the customer and then let people play and give the developer feedback so the game gets better. A lot of games get stuck and sometimes for understandable reasons. Some developers just wanna make money on the trend. But Bluehole has in my opinion made a fantastic game that has more potential than the majority of Early Access games.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-03-30,0,0,259,False,Not Recommended,PUBG is an absolutely horrific Battle Royale experience. It is incredibly depressing how little this game has changed over the course of half a year. I was so happy to play this game once I had set up my new PC when I was welcomed to this horrific experience with how poorly this game runs even on the worst of settings. Random crashes and other performance issues will make you want to switch to Fortnite at the drop of a hat. It's main rival being Fortnite has released a plethora of content from the release. PUBG has done absolutely nothing innovative compared to any other Battle Royale on the market. My next topic is quite narrow yet I believe it is deserving of it's hate. 3 Seater Bikes are a joke. They will commonly suspend the driver and the his allies into the atmosphere for little reason. Just using the brakes will result in your next NASA mission to Andromeda. Vehicle spawns are a joke. Sometimes you will locate multiple within 100 meters of each other while sometimes you will be lucky to locate a dune buggy for a squad of 4. Many structures located within the game are truly pathetic. Commonly you will find the laws of gravity being defied by a wooden plank. Another example being the iron bars. No matter where your crosshair or firearm barrel is located the giant hitbox will cause your bullets to miss your target and result in your unfortunate demise. The loot density is ridiculous. Commonly you will land with an opponent and locate no weapons while covering more ground while they will locate a shotgun or automatic weapon while you flounder trying to escape or fight back with little to nothing. Randomized loot is a core element yet sometimes a player can walk out of a gardening shed with all level 3 loot while one who loots Mylta Power may have a bad stroke of luck and only locate low caliber firearms and weaker armor. This game has a joke for an anti cheat. While I prefer FPP those who prefer TPP will commonly come across hackers. One personal experience was a man who killed me while I was at Mylta Power while he was at Lipovka with an AKM with a 2x (Which is roughly 500 meters). He hit every shot negating the massive bullet drop at this range which I struggled to negate with an 8x. The zone is a joke. It works in Fortnite because of building. During the dizzying adrenaline rush of 1v1 can be heartstopping. Yet these engagments are commonly sorted out by the zone. Instead of it closing near the center during the final moments it will choose one side and give the advantage to one player or team by making the others leave the safety of cover and possibly pushing through a field or other area which lacks proper protection. The zone is a clear decider of gun fights. My next complaint for this time is the plane path. While the lack of consistency may seem refreshing all it does is cut off certain parts if the map and make the zone terrifying if it is across the map from the plane path. This causes the entire lobby to relocate which is painful if you landed further way creating the need to combat those who were fortunate enought to be closer.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-04-16,0,0,119,True,Recommended,This game is so much fun and addicting. In order to win you have to earn it. You can't walk right in and win. Took me and friends over 60 90 tries minimum before we won our first game. Kills wins all of it isn't like some call of duty or battlefield game where you can get 20+ kills or win every game. All of it is earned. If you want a kill set up a tactics in order to take someone down you don't just rush in. (Unless pressured by the wall/some other opponent) Wins are HARD to get. Especially if you are new. Anyways I highly reccomend this game it's a ton of fun and you feel so epic when you get a kill (or kills) and/or win. Of course it's early access and bugs happen often. (Not to mention it's not very well optimized at the moment) But my computer can have this game on ultra settings quite well without much if any FPS drop.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-01-31,0,0,329,False,Not Recommended,To break it all down The NA and EU servers are flooded with high ping players from China because of this you are often killed because of lag or cheating which can ruin the experience. A dedicated group of friends or a Discord server is ESSENTIAL because all the teammates you're paired with randomly most likely does not speak the same language as you which ruins cooperation in teams which also ruins the experience. Meanwhile the developers are calling any fan of the game a racist when addressing these issues while they work at establishing micro transactions and condemning other Battle Royale games when PUBG itself is also unoriginal in some aspects.

The devs of the servers and trying to make it better day by day adding additional updates to enhance gameplay and make it more enjoyable for the playersMost of the ratings on this game are because of the viewing glitch will occurs for people with not alot of RAM however there is fixes for it you must look on youtube for that personally ive never experienced it but i know that can be a problem. The price is perfect for the game everyone wants games cheaper however as i've said previously early access game by paying for the game you're supporting the games development process will which also let you enjoy it more.Overall gameplay is brilliant and is currently the most grossing game as of now in the gaming community.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

This game is amazing and HIGHLY addicting! For an early access title it has been one of the few early access games that hasnt sucked! I personally enjoy PUBG and I am looking forward to its full release..Things I dislike Overall I enjoy all aspects of the game though I do dislike how fast some of the zones close in and wish there was more time to get geared up though respectfully I realize that this is done intentially and drives good fights/content and forces people to keep moving and not ""bunker"" up. Map Size/selection Simple put the starting map is fun but after 100hrs of game play it starts to become repetative the unique feel/experience you get of raiding a house for the first time dissipates when you have hit the same house couneltess times. Though rumor has it a new set of maps and mroe content is on the way!! Summery If your reading this review right now that means you either already have purchased this game or are about to. Either way the $$ you spend on this title will be worth it!! The game is unique as it shines as both a team based game where tactics and team orientation are super important..

2017-09-28,0,0,74,True,Not Recommended,"Well I have to say this game is pretty good with friends but it is fu* s* bad optimized in some machine specs. I don't know why there are some people with the same floating point performance computers and different behaviours at RAM usage.The texture size are so f* large and uncompressed no organization whatsoever about where the texture will be in the package that takes 3 minutes to load the house textures into an 90MB/s HDD and freezes constantly for 5 seconds stops loading textures and starts again in lots of non segmented locations. After loading everything goes PERFECT for ONE or two rounds!And after two rounds it doesn't reload some textures from RAM looks like every house has an own texture thing even if they are the same and starts again unloading and reloading already loaded things. Them it starts leaking memory going from the ""normal"" 6.3GB RAM usage to 7.8GB RAM usage at the same locations and cache miss a lot of things. Whew blows up the 8GB RAM I have.The problem is not at all with my hardware specs because after the whole lag to load textures and memory leaks it runs smoothly with no freezes at all 40 55FPS in lowest. But as it leaks memory it makes a lot of cache miss at the operational system making the system freeze waiting for data in the virtual memory (HD) because of non optimized things.Those are my specs Intel Core i7 870 4c 3.0GHzDual Channel DDR3 2x4GBSamsung HD that supports 90MB/s linear data.GTX 750 Ti overclocked up to 1250MHz.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-11-06,0,0,300,False,Not Recommended,"This game could've been great But instead we have something worse than CSGO. I used to love PUBG when I got it before the big 1.0 update At that time I sucked I didn't know how to even spot people but It felt new and fun. As I got better the 1.0 came out and I thought man this game is going places Then 7 months later nothing has changed. Sure small patch updates weapon additions / changes and there ""Anti Cheat"" updates and small features. I hate to bring Fortnite into this but I have to use it as an example As much as I dislike fortnite I'll admit it has more todo than PUBG. I was hoping PUBG would get different game modes daily weekly and monthly challenges and fix the ping issues with the servers. In my few times playing Fortnite I didn't have performance issues the connection between me and the server seemed better better yet I had some challenges to complete vs just getting battle points for cases you can't even open without spending irl money. And no I don t have a computer or internet as well Check my steam page for specs. Look I'm not a fortnite fanboy but that is not why i'm complaining about PUBG.PUBG took off made a ton of money and Bluehole spent all there development time on emotes and csgo style crates / keys. And now this game goes on sale? that should say something. Sure the 2nd map was a good addition along with some new weapons and the event modes can be fun. Speaking of the event modes The one with ARs and Sniper Rifles the deathmatch type mode was fun as hell and I played the out it How hard would it be to make that a gamemode not some 2 day event. The Kar98k with ghillie event mode was the most thing I've seen. There where some locations that were fun such as Stabler and the mountain next to Georgopol and the Prison location. But most of the time you get team killing on your team and you land in a city a city for Kar98s? I guess it makes it more interesting but I ended up having more kills with the sidearms than the Kar98k. (Some people may have liked this is just my thoughts)If you want to buy this game for 20 dollars (Until the sale ends on July 5) unless you have a group of friends or you're looking for something worse than CSGO for hackers and t kills / deaths this is the game for you. But this game is not worth 30 dollars let alone 20 in its current state. There is very little to do you'll spend 10 minutes looting just to get shot behind a wall and repeat. The only time I turn on this game is to play the event modes which like I said some of them are fun I loved the crossbow one.If this game had multiple game modes a better anti cheat fix shotguns pls better ping with servers better melee system challenges / quests and a leveling system of sorts to make you want to play and grind for content that you can USE then pubg will be worth 30 dollars.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-04-18,0,0,2091,False,Recommended,INTRODUCTION I bought this game back in August of 2017. I had known about it for several months but decided to hold off on it as I wasn't ready to get back into the multiplayer shooter genre. My Youtube channel ended up switching over from Clash Royale to PUBG. I now livestream PUBG 7 nights a week on my channel as a full time job. I have about 1200 hours into the game with probably over 200 wins although I do not keep track of my wins.THE GOOD Many years ago I was a competitive Halo 1 multiplayer gamer. I lost my interest in being a competitive gamer because there wasn't really any shooters I felt addicted to enough to put in that kind of time and commitment. It can be very frustrating and you can lose a lot of sleep because of practice marathons. CS/GO was the only shooter that I had thought about getting into but was already worn out on that game from the original CS mod for Half Life. PUBG has reinvigorated my passion for competitive gaming. The graphics are realistic. The variety of weapons is awesome with new ones on the way. The bullet drop feels realistic (coming from someone who was a Gunner's Mate in the Navy). I'm also a big fan of the overall military feel of the game. You get such an adrenaline rush from knowing that you can't respawn and that once you die the match is over for you. My heartrate still gets pumping everytime I'm in the top 10. I love the fact that I can play with my friends in squads. This is my favorite mode to play in. They also have Solo and Duo's you can play. I'm happy they added an FPP mode as well as third person feels clunky unrealistic (due to third person peeking) and slow. They now have a third map Codename Savage that they are working on and seems very promising as I have played it both times they've made it live on their Closed Experimental Server. This game has a lot of promise and could potentially become the next big Esports game. One in which I would love to compete in professionally.THE BAD 1.0 Release came out in the middle of December 2017. Unfortunately the game still has a lot of the same issues we've had since I've been playing it. And still feels like an early access game to me. Most of the problems and bugs the game has you don't see in typical AAA titles when they come out with their 1.0 full release. The game still has major desync issues mostly I believe to be caused by the Asian players that come onto the North American servers. It could also be that the developers never expected the game to be so record breaking and are having a hard time getting enough servers to accomidate the millons of players they have worldwide concurrently. It becomes very frustrating to peek from your cover and shoot someone then once your back behind your cover you get shot and die. Sometimes I will shoot someone out in the open with my reticle right on them and not hit them once because they are desync'd/lagging so bad. This is unacceptable to me given that it's 2018 and I have very fast cable internet. Also because I live so close to one of the NA servers. Sometimes the desync/lag feels so bad that I think it's worse than it was on Halo 1 when I played that competitively 15+ years ago. This has been an issue since I first started playing the game and only seems to be getting worse. There has been an outcry by the community for the devs to put in a region lock for many months now. At first the creator Brendan Greene called the community a bunch of racists and xenophobes. Which was incredibly insulting. Then about a month ago they said they would release a region lock soon but we have yet to see it come to fruition or hear about their progress with implementing it. They supposedly released a soft ping lock in the game but yet I can still hear Asian players over the proxy chat while in game. Although these Asian players could be using a VPN to fool the servers into thinking they have a lower ping than they really do. Am I starting to sound racist myself? No. I feel this way about the Asians because Battleye (PUBG's anti cheat software company) itself has released statistics that 99% of the cheaters in the game come from China. This is another issue that I feel the PUBG team DOES take seriously but they are not stern enough about. Most competitive multiplayer games have an extremely stern anti cheat system in place. So much so that they will implement a ban mid game. And typically it's an IP ban. I have never seen so many cheaters in any multiplayer game as much as I have in this one. This could be because the game is so record breakingly big. It could also be because of the monetized skins available. My game still does crash from time to time although it is not as bad as it once was so I feel they are making progress on that. It crashes just as much now as any other AAA title I play does. I do get some wierd FPS drops on occassion more so on the test and experimental servers though. The FPS drop frequency varies from update to update. I feel that the desync/lag/cheater problem would be greatly reduced if they simply followed the successful actions other AAA developers have taken by implementing tougher anti cheat like IP banning or even Steam account removal/limitation. Implementing a region lock will greatly aid in this as well. One thing which I feel isn't much of a big deal is I wish they would add weather back and allow for map/weather/time of day selection. I don't mind the desert map but when you get the desert map 15 times before you get the original Erangel map again gets a bit frustrating and boring. I feel as though they will be bringing weather back as they have been testing it on the new Savage map. I think people kept leaving the Fog map before because the fog was so thick that you could hardly see anything. I think if they just tone it down a bit people will enjoy it and play it again. Finally some of the playstyles you see in the game can get a bit frustrating. I like to either land far away from the plane alone with my squad to loot comfortably and then go hunting or drop into a hot location just so that I can get into fights and warm up a bit. One of the things I loved about this game is that they had a blue zone that pushes the players together to prevent camping. Most aggressive/competitive players would agree with me that camping is a boring and not a fun way to play. But there are still players who will camp in the corner of a building (even in FPP mode) without peeking just to wait until they hear your footsteps and shoot you in the back. It makes no sense to me that they are so scared in a video game A VIDEO GAME?! A video game is meant to be fun. It's not fun to me to sit in a corner and just hide the whole time. I'll never understand why people do this. This isn't necessarily something Blue Hole can fix as it happens in every multiplayer shooter game. So I can't blame the devs for this one. People will also try to fight with you outside of zone not scared of the blue zone. They buffed the damage by the zone but people still do it. I think they need to make the blue zone more damaging than it already is to discourage this.CONCLUSION This game is a great game overall despite the issues mentioned above. It's incredibly addicting and one that I feel I would want to play competitively in Esports. Once the issues are fixed and come out with a real 1.0 release (one that is polished and bug free) this game has the potential to be a 10/10 game. Just like Perfect Dark and Zelda Ocarina of Time were back in the late 90's. The game is only $30 which is half the price of any other AAA title which I feel makes the game worth it. Even though I joke on my channel when I'm having a bad night and say I don't recommend the game I definitely do. Buy this game. If I can get over 1200 hours out of a $30 game that in my book makes it a must buy.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

For a long time.The game is amazing though so much fun. Hours of hiding sniping running just amazing matches everytime.You will die. You will die and you wont know how. But one day you. will. eat. chicken. Edit after 300 hours. So lets get this straight. 300 hours i have seen 1 maybe 2 hackers.Some people are just salty or bad remember 1 winner(or squad) out of 100 people. Chances of people winning are slim.99 96 people walk away losers. That accounts for alot of negative reviews. Gameplay is 10/10 Servers are 4/10 (its like WoW used to be after XPACs came out) Graphics are 7/10 (on nasa computer maybe 8/10) Req to run is 6/10 (Im getting about 80FPS with 1050ti(reference)4gb modified settings) Over all after 300 hours i give the game a solider 7/10 for the price dont complain. I fully recommend this game at any price up to current full.Honestly this is a 60$ game if they would have 2 large maps 2 small maps and map selections.But with 2 large maps and 1 small comming this is a good game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Unfortunately thanks to the Highlights you get to re witness the garbage that sometimes ensues at this point in the game's development. Too many times have my bullet passed through the enemies head to inflict 0 dmg for me to recommend the game in its current state. I have to change the review to a negative for now until hit boxes and hit detection is dealt with. Im not going to even get into the randomness of DMG that guns do at certain times.6/10Will probably be amazing if they fix the major issues alone.

I have an i5 processor and a 960 graphics card. I still run the game on 110 120 fps almost constantly. The game really is not meant to be played on max settings. Having max foliage or max shadows gives you a huge disadvantage. Another complaint is hacking. I'm genuinely confused on why people complain so much about hackers in this game.

Since release the game has been extremely addictive it's got a great mix of fast paced gameplay with enjoyable graphics and cooperation in duo/squad matches however over the past month this game has taken a turn downhill considerably. With such a high popularity in the gaming community it's to be expected that people will no doubt attempt to exploit the game with the use of cheats/hacks but in PUBG this has gone tenfold. Over the past month the amount of hackers primarily from China's region has grown like a systemic virus and spread across all locations. These hackers use anything and everything to get the upper hand and I've seen it all. Aimbotters speed hacking god mode and more they've got it all. Sure the battleye system is banning tens of thousands of players daily but with over 4 million keys purchased in China alone over the past 3 weeks that's merely just a drop in the bucket of water.

If it wasn't for the adrenaline rush of constantly being on the run this would be a mediocre FPS at best. Simple things like addressing the lag or that this game seems to hate USB headphones would have been expected. Instead you can get yet another type of loot crate that require a microtransaction and be constantly killed by players who are stuttering across the screen as you try to figure out why your audio in your headset is messed up again.The problem is that you want to play this game the game mode is addictive but I find that more nights than not I end up angry that I decided to play.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-06-16,0,0,44,True,Recommended,PLAYERUNKOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS is a terribly named brilliant game brought to us seemingly out of the blue by Bluehole Inc. I've played roughly 10 hours and for what it's worth watched the game for many hours prior. In its current state I can safely say you'll be able to form a solid opinion on this games current state within that amount of time.To the point then.I think some of the reviews this game has gotten are unfair to not recommend the game after (what some players have) near one hundred hours playtime simply on the basis of occasional hit reg latency and performance issues is just a shame. What PUBG does it does well with inherently little room for error on its part. I'm not going to lie to you and say the game is perfect far from it. If you're not a fan of death match style king of the hill esq game play just don't purchase this game.That being said PUBG is one of the most comprehensive shooters of its kind to have come out in the Early Access format and with such brilliant pacing of its playerbase revenue and media coverage it's sure to only continue in its current trend of popularity for some time. When I originally played this game I likened some of its qualities to what I had wanted from DayZ Standalone and even initially avoided it because of those similarities but after playing the game properly experiencing the gripping tension this game has to offer in both single duo and squad queue's I'm quite happy to recommend this game wholeheartedly. It far surpasses any likeness it's had to previous titles (such as H1Z1 and the aforementioned DayZ) simply by being what it is a quality focused reasonably developed game.To finalise my thoughts here I'm going to admit I usually hate this genre of game in the past I have called it lazy half arsed development but really I am blown away by just how much I really like this game.I recommend PLAYERUNKOWN's BATTLEGROUNDS(Maybe re brand that name though.),PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-08,0,0,44,True,Not Recommended,"This game is completely overrated. It runs at 45fps with a GTX 980 looks blurry as unless you set AA to Very Low in which case everything just looks jittery and you cant tell the difference between a bush and a moving person.The circle moves way to quickly and if you get an unlucky drop you have no chance to get in the circle without a car with a car you'll just give away your position and die.Can't even kill people because the lag is so bad squad/duo feels extremely unsatisfying because you have to ""knock"" people out before you can kill them(Even with a sniper bullet to the head)Overall the game is impossible to win unless you wanna go to the centre and camp in a bush for 20 mins. Going to cities to kill people for fun is also not really an option since the game is so laggy and the close quarters combat is so that it's just annoying.

Played around 100 rounds 90% of the time i die in late circles it's just me ""walking in front of someone""... The death cam is always hilarious in the map i see they come stratight at me then when im just BLATANTLY in front of them they look left and right basicaally everywhere but wheree i'm before killing me trying to conceal that they know exacly where i'm. Not once i had the luck of someone just walking in front of me or creep behind someone.I went to the point of camping in houses while browsing the net or whatever and guess what they came stratight to me the house i was the division of the house i was straight to me and then when i was in front of them they start looking at the walls before shooting me XDGreat game completly useless and wortless because os cheating that they allow.Don't buy this crap if you are a honest person looking for a clean game. You gonna regret in a couple of games.this ""PUBG is what you get when amateur developers have a good idea for what could be a great game with a small budget to start with. Now that they've made many millions (close to a billion on PC sales alone) all they see is money. They no longer care about player experience. Why spend money to make the game better when most of the people that would buy the game have already bought it?Mistakes / poor decisions First mistake was the game engine that they built the game on. It wasn't designed for 100 players so they had to reduce the server tickrate to ridiculously low rates. There are better engines that can handle 100 players but I guess they went with the cheaper solution. Client side hit detection. This is why you can still get shot after you get into cover. Players with high ping have a big advantage over players with low ping. No region lock or ping lock. They talked about implementing this months ago but now you're racist or ""xenophobic"" toward Chinese people if you want this feature. Setting a max ping or locking players to their region would reduce the poor experience of having client side hit detection. Lootboxes. Everything about them. Some items like the school girl outfit sell for over $1k on the marketplace. Huge incentive for cheaters since you get points for kills and wins to buy these loot boxes with. They also just came out with locked lootboxes so you play to get your points to get the rewards and then you have to pay $3 to open the box or sell the box for around 25 cents (current price on the marketplace). Not really banning cheaters. Most cheaters sell all the items they get from their lootboxes Bluehole gets a cut of every sale. Then they ban the cheater but allow them to just buy the game again to keep playing/cheating/selling and the cycle continues. Bluehole makes money every step of the way so why would they change this? They make way more money from a cheater than they do from a regular player. STEREO sound... what year is this?? Some ""minor"" issues with game design that could be easily fixed like making bullets come from your gun instead of your chest slowing the circles down a bit etc. But compared to the above points these are pretty minor.What would make this game better? Engine that can handle 100 players with a decent tickrate. Server side hit detection (only works well with a good server tickrate). Actually ban cheaters (IP MAC address etc.). I know there are ways around it but it's not as easy as just buying another copy of the game. Sell rare items like the schoolgirl uniform for example. Lots of people like being able to sell/trade things on the marketplace so keep that if you must but if Bluehole sold items themselves (even just the rare items) it would control the prices and make cheating less lucrative. If they sold the schoolgirl outfit for like $50 they would make millions. Win win for everyone.If they had their own store for selling cosmetic items they would have a steady income stream from people that own the game and they wouldn't care as much about the steady income from banning cheaters and having them buy the game again. It would also give them incentive to improve the game to keep people playing and buying stuff. Bluehole can take these Desperado crates and shove them up their I will never buy a key to open one and I won't sell them on the marketplace so that they can make more money. Using points I earned to get a crate that I have to pay to open is not a reward greedy Region / Ping lock. There are servers in every major region why do people need to play on a server that's on the other side of the world? If the game had server side hit detection having a higher ping would be a disadvantage so it wouldn't be as big of an issue. Surround sound. Good positional audio is important in any FPS.If they made these changes I would recommend this game... but we're more likely to see a better studio make a better game before any of this happens.Why is it so popular then? It's exciting really gets the adrenaline pumping. You start with nothing and there's no respawn so everything you do matters and every decision you make can win or lose the round for you where to drop what to loot how long to spend looting where to go when to go there when to fight when to flee etc. Randomness of loot and circles makes those decisions and each round a little different. Option to go solo duo or squads each mode changing the way you play the game.All of this makes for a fun and addicting game.. until you die to a cheater or someone with high ping killing you after you get into cover (or they came around the corner and saw you before you could see them) or not being able to hit the guy outside your building because your bullets are coming out of your chest and hitting the window sill etc.The most frustrating thing about all that is that Bluehole is not doing enough to fix it. The only punishment for cheaters is having to buy another copy of the game how greedy can you get? They don't want to region/ping lock because they don't want to offend the Chinese and they make a lot of money from them especially since a large majority of the cheaters are from China. That's not racism that's fact.There are several Chinese players in every round on NA servers many of them are cheaters some of them are just there to get away from the asian servers that are full of cheaters but they still have an advantage due to their high ping. 0.05% of them are there to play with their friends in NA and that's the main reason Bluehole said they don't want to region/ping lock. In squads and duo's where communication is very important it really sucks to get teamed up with someone that can only speak enough english to say ""China numba wun"".Greed and incompetence ruined what could have been an awesome game. This just seems to be a very short sighted money grab when it could easily be a long term revenue stream.""",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

None of that stops you from enjoying the game now but beware if you don't have a modern PC that it might be better to wait as the optimalization will eventually be targeted towards consoles as well.I love the gun mechanics with mods and sounds.

I really enjoy playing it with friends but I think that th developers have a lot more work to optimize this game...A LOT more work. That being said PUBG is NOT worth $30.Personally I've had really good games and then I've had extremely games where Asian hackers or graphics completely ruin the game. The thing is that if you play on the lowest graphics setting grass won't render that far meaning that if someone let's say 100m 200m out is laying in grass you won't see the grass but you'll see the person. Not only that but I hate that no matter what I'll be spending half the game looting or running across the map and die just like that.Not only that but playing most of the maps you'll find yourself in the middle of butt nowhere. I mean literally half of the map is just empty space...not so realistic imho. The thing is that the developers don't really focus on optimizing the current maps they only care about pushing out new content which in turn is (except the 4x4 map...that's an ok map).The really ed up thing is that I keep getting sucked into this game because 1. I don't really care for building in ing Fornite and 2. I honestly can't ing find a decent battle royale game to play and love WITH FRIENDS.On a side note I think I'd like this game so much more if I didn't have to play with people from another country (aka ING ASIA at least the one's who don't know how to speak English.)

In my opinion this game is alot better than H1Z1 King Of The Kill however there is a few things I would like to see fixed such as. Wider variety of vehicle spawns. Laggy Lobbies And finally better loot spawns. That is all I have to say about BATTLEGROUNDS over all I think it is an amazing game with great potential. Taylor.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The island is huge the matches are quick and 'controlled' and weapons/armor are scarce so exploration is a key factor to your survival. I will be thrilled as the updates come out to patch up bugs and performance issues though more for the latter as I haven't found too many bugs in the few matches I've played.Is the price tag too high?

2017-04-30,0,0,191,True,Not Recommended,I struggle to give this game a negative review. I really like the concept and I realize it's an alpha. It can be quite fun. But that's where it ends for me. I've seen what seems like aimbotters on almost every single match though it is hard to tell sometimes because we don't get a kill cam. There's literally no reason not to have a kill cam. If you're worrried about people giving away the position of their killers to their teammates then just let us review the kill cam AFTER the round ends. There's no excuse not to have one. It's really important for calling out cheaters in a game like this where it's difficult to pinpoint the position of enemies anyway.I get it it's an alpha none of these things should really be counted against a game like this at this point in time. The devs seems pretty active and there are updates. However I bring these things up because this game is still $30. $30 for a game with only one gameplay mode? Survival? Only one map? Seems a bit steep. $30 $40 seems very fair for the finished polished version of this game. But for an alpha this should fall under the $15 20 category IMHO.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I've been playing the test servers a ton recently and let me tell you it is amazing. Vaulting Amazing. Mystery Machine/Party Bus Amazing New Menu Amazing. New HUD Amazing. New Map Amazing. It's amazing to see how far this game has come and I can't wait to see where it goes from here. I highly recommend this game but don't forget that you are buying an early access title.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-11-28,0,0,2,True,Not Recommended,First game that I've actually asked for a refund on. After watching quite a bit of gameplay on twitch I was interested so I picked it up not having any friends on that had it I jumped in to squad matchmaking hoping to get a handle on the game with other players. Unfortunately in the handful of games I played inside my 2 hour limit not once did I get matched with anyone that spoke the same language as me. I was playing on NA servers being from the west coast but there doesn't seem to be any language prefrences when it comes to match making. People were rubber banding around screaming into their mics and the experience was just generally awful.I can totally understand how this game would be fun with some friends but without? No dice. Unless some form of region locking and language enfrocement is included this game is a no go for a solo player.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Drop near the middle of the map grab some gear be in the cirlce wait 20 minutes get shot once drop to 4 FPS then die before I can return fire. Another big problem I saw with it was that it was released in Early Access and I do not feel that it should have been. It feels a lot like it was released in EA just so they could have an excuse for when not if the players ran into crippling bugs.The last big problem I've found is that if the player doesn't have a monster and I mean a ing MONSTER of a PC the game will run horribly. Sometimes building textures won't load for 5 10 minutes and I'll be stuck jerkin it in a corner while all the bad guys grab guns. overall I can say that if you have a friend telling you ""buy this game dude its the greatest game ever made nothing compares to how great it is"" or something similar...just please take it with a grain of salt and maybe try and play a few games on his account/PC before you buy it yourself",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-17,0,0,76,True,Not Recommended,I don't even know why I was talked into buying this piece of crap. This is literally just another steam early access survival game but with a battle rolaye twist which I admit was a decent idea. However it brings with it all the cons that you would watch out for in those awful survival games like abysmal optimization janky animations inconsistent quality of gameplay horrendous netcode unintuitive inventory management ugly graphics and some t mechanics. I would be lying if I said I never had ANY fun playing this game. Especially in squads with friends you could possibly have a good time now and then. I've even won 1st place a couple of times which is apparently what's supposed to hook you into the game. But no I do not like this game. It needs to play well. It needs to have refined and enjoyable gameplay which feels good to play. I can't deal with the horrible quality of gameplay here. There's SO much room for improvement.The only thing good about this game is the idea of a battle royale type game mode. Literally any other developer could come up with another PUBG clone and make it 10 times better. coughFortniteBRcough. I think the only reason PUBG is where it is right now is because the devs may/maynot have paid off a bunch of twitch streamers to stream their game on day one and get the blind masses into it and turn it into the next big fad. Then don't even get me started on people getting banned for t reasons and the amount of hackers running wild in this game. I really have to try hard to make this an enjoyable experience and I think I'm just gonna stop trying.I definitely do not recommend this game. If however you're really into FPS games and want to expeirence this game mode try out FortniteBR. It's basically the same gameplay (Albeit a lot more polished) and it's completely free. If it turns out that you really can't live without Battle Royale and want more then hell try out PUBG as well for a more realistic janky and overall kinda experience.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I honestly wouldn't play unless it was with friends but since I've seen many friends be able to play solo and still enjoy themselves I would not say friends are required to have a good experience.This game starts as a suspensful thriller where you play cautiously to avoid losing because of the time you spent to survive and gather equipment. However I feel this game begins to shine more when you overcome that anxiety and can play thing game with calm directed effort. From what I understand this games support from the devs is cery poor mostly due to the studio funding it being primarily focused on mobile which do not have the business models that favor dedicated fans.

2018-07-09,1,1,599,False,Not Recommended,This actually does pain me to give PUBG a negative review because I geuinely do think it is a really fun game and in my opinion the best battle royale game out there. So bear in mind that I am starting this review by saying it is actually good game with good mechanics and especially fun when you get a group of friends to play with. This is where it all goes downhill. I believe the developers are now just in it for the money. I was hoping by bringing out the (paid for) Event Pass they would keep the other in game rewards purchasable by the BP currency received from playing games but no. The random weekly crates used to be all free and bought with BP however even they are now split between free and locked crates you have to buy keys for. These crates should JUST be purchased with BP and no way at all affiliated with real money. It's pure greed. The BP earned in game is useful for almost nothing at all now as I get locked crates 80% of the time I get one. The Event Pass is paid for the exclusive skins are paid for. Not only this but the Event Pass that costs (about) 8 also contains items that you do not even get to keep! Let just something be earned from actually playing the game we have already spent 27 on. The developers seem like arrogant greedy and uncaring people who are only in it for the money and not making this game as amazing as it should be.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-02-28,0,0,120,False,Not Recommended,This game has a lot of potential. Save yourself the money and buy blackout. This game is trying to be arma yet failing in every way to be arma. Arma is fun because it's a military simulator. Your expectations are set as such. This game is a buggy . Graphics are both awful and good at the same time. This means that for the 30 sec to 40 minutes you are in the game you will either die immediately by getting shot through walls killed by people with perfect aim that appear out of nowhere and weren't being rendered or melee'd so ing fast with their fists that you only get one swing at them with your pan (please bluehole ing explain that one to me) or you will die in a punch fight where every punch your enemy throws has a 10 foot reach while yours requires you to click a pixel... or you will go the full 40 minute game without seeing a single other person and die of boredom only to be shot and instantly killed by somebody in a different map alltogether. This may be the only game where playing on full graphics settings literally gives you a disadvantage. Want to hide in the grass? Too bad it doesn't render on anybody else's machine making you the easiest target since neon lighting.And lets talk about the ing lag. I was in a duos game and we were in a firefight. My partner goes down out of the blue and about an entire second later the enemy shot the 3 shots that downed him and I saw the blood spurts in MID ING AIR. Am I being penalized for having good internet speeds? Do I need to throttle my upload just to be on an even playing ground? CAN WE PLEASE ING REGION LOCK CHINA or make the hit detection server side and not client side? Let's talk about the most important part of this game. Loot. Did you enter 3 buildings to look for a gun and need to find one fast because somebody landed next to you? Well here you go! A melee weapon backpack and a bunch of first aid! Won't that be helpful! NOMeanwhile the enemy player has found 16 rifles lvl 56 armor a godmode pickup and can now see you through walls. Don't ask me how. All that in his little hut.What was so god damn refreshing about blackout is that THERE ARE GUNS ON THE ING MAP. I know its a novel ing idea but yknow maybe don't make the most important item in the game so scarce that you HAVE to land away from everybody just to find ONE. Then there are scopes. Do you want a red dot? Too bad they don't exist. Looking for a 4x? Here are 18 red dot sites. Found an 8x? God forbid you find a ing weapon to attach it to. They included a practice range in the update which is ing fantastic and should have been available on release but yknow it's kind of worthless because you will never find enough equipment to actually put that practice to good use. Oh and that one time you do you will be shot from the other side of the map.This game is $30. You will have more fun taking a lighter and burning that $30 instead.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I do agree with other reviews that the game has bugs but it is completely playable if you have a mid range pc.SSD in this game is a must if you don't want to face the 'very long loading bug' which will probably annoy you or make you killed.I disagree with everyone who complains about the micro transactions. How the hell are they suppose to develop and run the servers in a long run tell me? How are they suppose to host tournaments? Yes they do get profit out of it but if you won't make any profit then what's the point of the gaming industry? However I agree with those who say that they prioritize microtransactions and force the bugs into the game just because they want to launch the boxes ASAP. Overall I rate this game 8/10. + The best Looting Dying and Running simulator which will not make you rage (maybe a bit)+ Recently added first person servers which make the game a lot more fun and balanced+ Vehicles make you cry especially bikes+ Best co op game that really requires a teamwork+ Can earn money by selling the crates on Steam Market D not anymore as of 14 Sep 2017 Need to be optimised more Some decisions are annoying like launching First Person Servers to NA or EU only (as of 10 AUG 2017) As of 14 Sep 17 still unavailable on SEA servers. Weapons like tommy gun and some other guns can be looted from the Plane Crate only which is disappointing because some of the weapons are kind of pointless As of 14 Sep 2017 tommy guy has been removed from the crate and added to the world drop. it is a + Revolver with the Silencer is a lot more silent than any other pistols like what? Crossbow takes way too long time to reload but damn fun to use (if you get kills) pretty fast now 3rd person servers are bullPOOP and unbalanced Vaulting system hasn't been introduced and it is a pain in the butt to jump through some fences or windows (E3 footage is great) this feature is to be released soon. Meanwhile can use macro (just google it). Some annoying bugs have been introduced with the new patch (as of 10 AUG 2017) which cause my friends' game to freeze or disconnect (however I do not face any issues probably they need to get SSDs) fixed I guess/ Graphics are not important in this game (textures maybe but nothing else because those who play on the lowest settings have the advantage)/ Do not listen those who say ""DON'T PURCHASE THE GAME LOADING FOREVER"" it is true if you don't have an SSD but come on it is 2017 everyone can afford 128gb SSD right?/ It is better to play with friends if you want to enjoy the game for a long time but SOLO is also fun",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-25,0,0,224,False,Not Recommended,Ill start off with my only real issue with the game. I had my server set to NA and it somehow changed to AS. it took me a bit to realize why I was playing with what seemed to be mainly Chinese and Korean players. When I switched my server back to NA I was hoping to join squads and duo games with mainly english speaking players. I was wrong... I joined a game and my 3 squad mates were from China. They proceeded to yell things at me like China number 1 and then after I looted a couple houses they shot me in the back. As I laid there bleeding out they proceeded to t bag me yelling China number 1.... these are supposed to be teammates... This has happened very frequently.... Whenever I join with English speaking players that are clearly supposed to be on the NA servers I have a great experience. Now onto gameplay... Its very intense. You can win the game without getting a single kill. You can drop into an area that is dense with buildings and hope you get a good gun right away and start taking out players that didnt get so lucky with items available at their drop point. Once you make it past the initial insertion and you start to find gear for the long haul it starts to get a lot more interesting. Surviving after everyone else starts to get equipped becomes a big challenge. As the map starts to shrink and you are forced into moving to different areas so stay with in bounds it can turn into cat and mouse real quick. You always need to assess if its worth engaging someone you see. Do you expose yourself for a kill and try to look them? Could be a bad idea if someone else is also watching them and wait for you to kill them then kill you while you are looking them... Its raw survival tactics. I would have complained about the game optimization before but since the update its received a big improvement performance wise. I have a nvidia 970 superclocked edition by evga a 1st gen i7 920 12gb ram 1tb hdd. Load times are not really a big deal because you have to wait to drop in anyway. pre optimization my fps never really dropped below 35. I was playing on high settings 1080p. I tried 4k just out of curiousity but the game wouldnt allow me to run that resolution. the UI was all out of wack and not able to navigate menus. post optimaztion update I run ultra everything 1080. I hover around 60fps outside of buildings. I havent tried to run 4k since the optimization but the game is great at 1080 and Id imagine you would have to be running a rig that maybe only 10% of PC gamers actually own to run full 4k. definitely recommend this game to people that enjoy shooters or survival games.Edit I no longer want to deal with the hackers in this game... It has ruined the entire thing for me. to top it off I was just woke up at 330am because someone tried to access my account and successfully did from Asia... I have a bunch of foreign lettering in the email from steam saying my account password changed then the phone number associated with the account was changed... in the 10+ years I have had steam I have never had an issue one... shorty after I get pubg and play it an Asian gets on my account... I am hoping they didnt have time to get on pubg and use hacks on my account so that when I get back on there my game isnt banned... Ill be beyond upset about that.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-03-26,0,0,550,True,Recommended,"alright a think i have enough HOURS in this game to give a very clear and precise review.1) My Opinion on the Whole GameIts fun! It's addictive. When I first got the game on march i never owned a Battle Royal game. But after trying H1Z1 i regreted paying and playing that game this game is clearly on top with bug fixes coming in weekly and monthly a postive community (but like half of it is still toxic) and just a great dev team staying active and helping as much people as they can.The game has its t moments like head glitches hackers etc but as i said with such an active dev team they try their best to fix any problem in the game which i like. The $30 pay for the game is it worth it? YES! This team needs it to run the servers pay the team and get on the road i dont think that game would be where its at right now if it wasnt for all of us buying the game in the first place.alright now lets dig a little deeper in this hole of a world.2) CombatIts fair. as much as i hate to say it. AND I KNOW PEOPLE WILL SAY ""HOW? I PULLED THE TRIGGER FIRST MY GUN HOLD A MORE POWERFUL ROUND!?!?!"" &lt that is me a lot ask my friends LOL &gt but its as fair as it can be no matter what anyone who has played the game can tell you when you get a kill its satisfying. Now if you're reading this review to see if you should buy the game let me explain to you how the combat works in the different ways you can play. So when you're playing SOLO basicly aim for the body or head straight forward ever play arma or dayz works the same way. NOW if you're playing DUO its a bit different health is cut down a bit takes less bullets to kill ive notice BUT the person will be knocked down if their partner is still alive and can pick them up sorta like left 4 for dead or some Well squads is the same as duo but ive also noticed health is knocked down even more cause it takes a LOT less bullets to knock an UNARMOURED dude down in squads then any other and like duo you can pick them back up.thats all i can think for the combat!3) GUNS GUNS GUNS!!Everyone loves guns and theres a lot of em! From Pistols like the 1911 or the G18 (called the p18 cause they didnt get the rights LUL) to SMGS like the Vector or UMP (no one liked the uzi unless you're a nerd) or some classic AR's like the AK Scar M16 or M4 and the snipers Kar98 or SKS Theres a lot to choose from. BUT something i didnt know about till i played more when i first started ! AIRDROPS !Now i only remember airdrops from Rust but it came with armour and and some guns military grad guns. Well same thing in this game. They keep adding ing guns to the airdrop which is getting annoying but it makes it more exciting to see whats inside the red crates! So far inside the crates you can get Kar98s (takes 7.62) M249 (takes 5.56) AWM (takes 400 Magnum) Ots 14 (takes 7.62) And they just added in the classic MK14 which also take 7.62!!So far for ammo from smallest to biggest this is what you can get 9mm 45mm 5.56 7.62 12 Gage 400 magnum.4) ArmourAs long as you get atleast a level 2 vest its been proven its as good as level 3 so you're good.5) Finaledidnt cover everything but if anyone has any question id be glad to answer them.finale verdict 8/10(why not 10/10 you ask? cause the game still has a lot to work to great game and endless entertainment but it isnt perfect yet it will be soon though!!!)",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

John was playing a nice battle royale game with his friends on the 24th of September. After losing a few games he decides to call it a night. The next morning when he wakes up he finds a game ban on his Steam account. When he looks into it he finds it it's from PUBG! John decided to fight it so he asked about it but PUBG told John they had evidence of him playing and hacking on the 25th of September whereas his Steam account said John last played on the 24th. John mentioned this to them and in short they said to stop contacting them and kept the ban.Knowing this I was done with the game.

2017-09-12,0,0,149,True,Recommended,Player Unknown's Battlegrounds is a next level strategy based simulator (battle royale) that nails its concept and genre. This game will keep you playing even at its current early access state. The game has recieved updates which fixed many early issues and optimisation. This game presents beautifully on dedicated gaming machines and also is able to be optimised well on intel 640 graphics core i5 and i7 notebooks adjust in game graphics (low) startup scripts (currently) and your intel graphics settings to achieve a solid 25 35 fps. Like Game feel sound item drops strategy squads new FP Duo Server for Oceania!.

While this game is still fun if you're playing alone playing with other people really makes this game great.This is one of those games that you can just pickup and play without much explanation. I remember the first night I played I kept saying ""I'll play one more match"". After about 6 matches I completely lost track of time. It can be addictive!

2017-07-11,0,0,87,True,Recommended,"I believe I have enough hours in to give a review so here it goes....Bugs I've found two issues. One is after a match I never go back to the main menu. It just hangs at the background and I have to End Task. The other is lagging out. I think the servers may be crashing out because in twos it happens to both of us. It starts lagging bad then kicks us out.Guns like everything so far but haven't had enough time to fully get a feel. Attachments are awesomeCars love all the vehicle spawns... easy to find and not OP.Loot Balance in KOTK I can loot 5 houses in the time I can loot one or two in PUBG. Sometimes I will go to 4 before I find a backpack and/or helmet. It would be nice if the loot was tweaked. I feel like KOTK is more geared around giving an advantage to who gets good stuff and PUBG is more geared to give advantage to those that are more tactical and cautious. I don't thing RNG has a place in this gameGameplay everything is smooth... I love it. Looting feels natural and weapons/attachments are cool. I get very bored mid game however. Everyone just goes in a building and hides. In two games I drove all over the circle twice and never seen anyone or got shot out. Eventually I seen a person in a window. They hid once I stopped. I've only made it to the end twice because I get bored and start rushing houses.I don't know how to solve my major complaint... I don't want any major rule changes... maybe some sort of incentive to get out and about but not necessarily any kind of penalty. I don't like penalizing a play style but it would be cool if there was a reason that made u want to get out.It's easy to say ""don't go in houses mid game"" but damn I get bored after sitting around a few minutes. Earlier I stopped in a car in the middle of the circle for about 3 minutes. Went and made a margarita and I was still alive.

I'm scrolling through in search for PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds. I'm right clicking it and motioning toward the ""uninstall"" option. I'm left clicking the uninstall button prompting a Steam message to pop up that asks if I'm sure I want to uninstall this game. Am I? Am I sure I want to uninstall PUBG? Yes. Here's why They managed to create one of the highest selling games in history and it's one of the most buggy sluggish poorly coded messes I've ever played. How do you make almost half a billion in sales on one title and STILL manage to not fix some of the most simple issues a game could have? Outside of PUBG what other popular shooters have prominent D sync? Literally none of them. It's a laughable company that could've fostered one of the best shooters ever but decided to turn toward garbage skins and useless addons over actually making the game playable. And that's not to mention the rampant hacker issue the community is dealing with.That being said the gunplay and leaning mechanic make it moderately enjoyable. I can't say that I haven't had fun playing it since release because that'd be a blatant lie. Regardless PUBG is another H1Z1 game meaning that when it inevitably dies it's DEAD.

If you say yes to these questions you will love Playerunknown's Battleground. Brace yourselves for an exciting battle that starts out with 99 other players all crammed in the back of a cargo aircraft jumping out at different times to parachute at back breaking speeds. Quickly land in a small village and find military grade weapons and armor or land in a military base to find a red bull and that new hat you've always wanted. Then take a quick look at your map to see how far you will have to travel to make it inside the zappy zap wall. Travel can occur mainly if not always by foot or if you are lucky you will find a vehicle Vehicles range from a two seater motorcycle to a 5 seater SUV only 5 of which will flip faster then a fidget spinner being spun by that one edgy kid in Mr. Pinkletons movie review class. Then combat your way through droves of other enemy players who eat bullets or are to dumb to notice your existance. After a long brutal battle and with a little bit of luck you can be awarded your very own chicken dinner. Most likely through you will disconnect at a cruical moment leaving your afk body to be brutally beating by thre strongest weapon and toughest armor a frying pan. Between invisable enemys and only finding seventeen pairs of pants a match. This game is fun for you and all your friends to rage at for hours on end. 3/7.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-28,1,1,1355,True,Not Recommended,Hackers. Enough said. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND AT ALL. If you want to win the game camp. If you are unsure where to drop drop military base because the map ends there 90% of the time. If you can pick up a shotgun as it can snipe people across maps even when they have a vest on and they are more powerful than Zeus's lightning bolt. The scaling of damage on shotguns are ridiculous.The fences and walls in this game are also ridiculous. This game was an awesome game before the recent updates. This game needs a MASSIVE amount of altering. P.S PlayerUnknown guarenteed at least 80% of the players DO NOT WANT TO PLAY ON THE RAIN MAP. You can't hear a thing and all you have to do to win on that map is to go prone and not even GOD HIMSELF can see you.The altering of the circle times have also destroyed the game. That extra minute makes a huge difference as you can go through at least 2 more houses to look for that sniper rifle that you're not going to find. What is up with the water in the game as well? Just because you are in the water or submerged all of a sudden you have become an invincible demigod? The hell is up with that? Want to make top 10 at least? All you have to do is find a car drive it to the centre of the circle and sit in a bush and VOILA! Instant top 10. Even with foilage at 'very low' you still can't see people in certain bushes.

2018-06-26,0,0,375,False,Not Recommended,"I spend playing this game over 270+ hours. The total amount of playing might seem a lot for some people but these hours are not ""real"" i will explain later. First of all the game has a brilliant idea a circle during the match forces you to stay inside it so you don't lose damage. If you stay too long outside the circle you die and because of that many people makes strategies that are using this in their advance. The thrill of trying to stay inside the circle is a great feeling specially in the last one where you could easily win or die in a matter of seconds. I have won solo or in a team not so many times but i really enjoy playing because of that feeling that makes you looking everywhere until the last second. The gunplay is also good with some minimal improvements that could be made. And now the bad side.Specially in the early days of the game the driving and the collision system didn't work very well. You could die easily if you drove a motorcycle without doing something crazy. The collision system sometimes could make your vehicle fly to the sky and you died in a horrible way. Also in the early days there wasn't any region lock and you could end up in a game with chinese hackers and people that you couldn't communicate. Also hackers are almost in every single match since the beginning i have seen many crazy things from these guys. Now the biggest disadvantage for this game is the loot box mania. The devs don't seem to care to fix this game since the beginning they had spend more time creating loot boxes content than fixing the actual game. Nowdays it's still the same and even more horrible. Right now and since 3 big patches if i want to play a game i have to do the following. I have to start the game 5 9 times until i can get to the main menu. This is because the game is constantly crashing to the desktop. When i get the chance to start a match i can play it until at some random point i could get another crash that leads to the desktop once again. From that point i can try to either once again run the game 5 9 times so i can continue my match or i could end up in a connection problem in which i am forced to quit the current match. I have to say that my CPU is an Amd Ryzen 1700. I know many people that have problems with many cores cpus. I have tried everything to find a solution but nothing seems to be working. So the conclusion is... DO NOT BUY and support this game. The devs are blind due to the enormous earnings of this game. Over 50million copies sold but not proper optimisation. I will still keep an eye to see if they fix anything but until then i will avoid playing this game.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-07-18,0,0,187,False,Not Recommended,*TL DR at the bottomI played a lot of PUBG. Past tense. Recent descisions such as their bootleg Battle Pass in a $30 game and the simple fact that they are even considering locking custom mathces behind a paywall. I love the tactical gameplay and the shooting mechanics of this game. The militaristic style is probably my favorite part about it but the company behind it really isn't. As many other people are I'm extremely dissapointed with how Bluehole has been treating the community lately. When I started playing it was easy to see BH as a company that cared about the community as PUBG is the intellectual child of a long time gamer Brendan Green. But then they got a taste of success and were hooked. Record sales and player counts weren't enough paid crates weren't enough and even now their bootleg BP isn't even enough. If anyone is considering picking up PUBG at the moment and that is why you are reading this review I implore you to not. At least at the moment. For now take your buisness with Battle Royale elsewhere. If you want to have a more casual experience support Fortnite. Their developers are extremely receptive to the community. If a more competitive BR is more your style try out Realms Royale. TL DR Bluehole is making bad descisons. Don't buy this game right now.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-11-19,0,0,418,False,Not Recommended,Product received for free. This game sucks. I remember seeing this game in the middle of summer and wanting it so badly. It looked like a really fun game so when i got the chance to get it I couldn't resist. Although I was pretty at the game I always had tons of fun. This was September. Fast forward to December and the devs make PUBG and official game. The desert map came out and it looked like the game was going in the right direction. But I was wrong. After 1.0 the game kept going downhill. Soon into January I lost interest in the game and headed over to R6. After months of not playing the game I finally went back to it in May and saw what had happened to the beloved game that a year earlier was probably the best game to get on steam. I saw that the bugs weren't fixed Asia wasn't region locked they still had no map selection the amount of international servers was sad. Bored and now saddened I returned to R6 again. June came along and I had found out how horrible the game had become. Bugs still not fixed and not an Event Pass rivaling Fortnite's Battle Pass. They also added weapon skins. Instead of focusing on bugs and optimization they focused on more microtransactions. The game is now slowly dying thanks to Fortnite which is also started to die. Thank god that battle royale games are finally meeting their death. The game that I had once admired 10 months earlier was now completely ruined and awful.

I reccomend this to everybody despite there being a ton of glitches and things its actually really funny whenever a glitch happens and no they dont happen every single game or something but even if you are doing good and you die by a hilarious glitch It to me is more worth it.

2017-09-14,0,0,430,False,Not Recommended,This game is an unoptimised mess that will always feel like its still in the beta state. It's absurd how the driving and jumping mechanics is as well as a few other basic mechanics you'd expect to work. In 2017 how the hell do you fail at making a main menu?? Having a menu refresh button for when the menu doesn't work is ridiculous. Not to mention how and desynchronized the replay system is. At the end of the day it's the idea of battle royale that keeps you playing not the actual game itself. Wait till you can get this game on special before buying it especially since there are free to play battle royale games much better than this.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-27,0,0,765,True,Recommended,I wont state the obvious you can read all of that in all of the comments if you stop by my review then I hope this helps you decide to buy it or not.1. Graphs are not the best but its one of those games that doesnt need it like CS or quake the gaming experience is very exiting but be aware that the engine is not yet pulished so its asking alot of processing power.2. No hackers! well there are some videos about it The gameplay has not been affected by lots of hackers or glitches abusers like other FPS when recently released. 3. Community game is based in communication that enhances the experience join the discord servers.4. Fast or slow pace your choice you can choose your strategy where to land engage everyone you see or go ninja stealth... 5. Active development team thats the best you can ask in an open beta game plus big companies already have their piece of bluehole (developer) adding the needed founds to go out of beta strong.Few cons I found but are worth mentioning 1. Economy is going to be similar to CSGO which it sucks..2. Not very optimize and there are wierd bugs 3. The game doesnt have a ranking or level sistem which it means that you can find yourself against pros at any time.4. guns need to be enhanced and they have to remove some features like clothing spawn takes processing time and add more attachments and gear to the drop.All and all the game is worth the money and your time I have over 200 hours playing it and I havent found a reason to stop playing it.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-10-19,0,0,418,True,Recommended,PUBG is fantastic. Get it in early access for a cheaper price than full release.The gunplay is simple but effective and you learn to adapt your playstyle based on what you've got on you. You might be restricted with a certain weapon but that's not to say you can't get yourself in a position where that weapon will be an advantage. The gameplay as a whole is based on a random number generator (RNG) so what you get where the plane goes where the loot crates drop is all down to sheer luck. Don't be fooled this is a good thing. You can use every situation the game throws at you and take advantage of it ambushes aggressive rushing and sitting in the grass with patience are all feasible strategies each with their own pros and cons.It's been a work in progress since I got it but the developers are constantly fixing and adding things. They're always transparent too so it's not like you'll not be able to log on and have no idea why.I've had no issues with server stability sure I've encountered a glitch or two in 1% of my games but this is too good to pass up based on that particularly as the full release is coming soon.I've had 9 total wins so far and I'll have many more because this game is not dying out any time soon.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-06-21,0,0,64,False,Recommended,Honestly all the negative reviews seem like a bandwagon. PUBG may have a lot of problems but it isn't nearly as bad as a lot of people are saying and most of those problems could be fixed by Bluehole. Many people are saying that other games like fortnite are better but they are more so just different. Fortnite in my opinion requires very little mechanical skill. The main way to win is to learn how to build and use shotguns. This game however requires you to learn how to position aim for bullet drop with every weapon shooting from long/medium range with an AR isn't based on bloom you can ads etc. This game's concepts are much more interesting and have a much higher skill gap. This game still has a lot of potential and even with all of its problems can still be fun. Also even though people talk about hackers in this game I have never had to deal with one.First Shot Accuracy in Fortnite This may have fixed some of the problems but it still doesnt fix that if one person is lucky they will outdamage you.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2018-02-18,0,0,316,False,Not Recommended,"I like this game at its core the overall gameplay is very fun and enjoyable but the rest is garbage. I'm so tired of getting excited to see that PUBG has added new content only for it to be $20+ bucks. I already paid 30 bucks for the game why must I pay almost the same amount for cosmetics. And I know that some items (The ONE Halloween item) can be earned with BP which is fine I don't mind having the option to buy the cosmetics with real money as long as you can get the cosmetics with earned in game currency. And another thing the loot boxes they suck so much. I hate how you end up getting the same 3 shirts or pants its such a waste of in game money.Now another problem I have is the ranking up/mission system. At its core main idea I support it but I hate how some items aren't permanent. Why waste all my time to get a shirt that lasts 5 10 however many days? Now I know that you can get permanent items but its every 10 levels which is excessive and stupid.One last huge problem I have the lack of customization with the custom server I know this problem probably isn't as big to others as it is to me but it bothers the hell out of me. Why is it so hard for me to just want to play with 2 3 friends? I don't want to have a minimum of 32 ing players in my match it is so annoying.So really in conclusion I like the gameplay and the overall ""feel"" of the game/gameplay itself. And I am happy that Bluehole is fixing problems within the game such as optimization and cheating but the rest is just scummy and it really shows how Bluehole also doesn't give a about us and is in only for the money.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

It needed this ""fix pubg"" project a year ago and it still desperately needs it now (Since it doesn't seem like they've done a lot and every issue they fix just brings in MORE issues.) Desync issues are probably the worst from ANY game I've experienced. On my end I shot a guy about 5 7 times in the killcam I didn't even shoot once. Things like this are completely unacceptable in a game of this scale that has made this many sales already. Especially with the 'e sports ready' scene in it.Recent experience has made me never want to play this game again. The LAST 2 games I played had the most ridiculous ing encounter. The first game I was one shot headshot through a level 1 helmet by an M16 which I've never been able to do. The very next game I headshot somebody who did NOT have a helmet with an AKM which has a higher damage than the m16 and they survived to kill me.PUBG is fun but that doesn't mean it's a good game and it's not.I would not recommend this game to anyone until it has been further updated.**UPDATE**Shoutout to shitho I mean Bluehole for being the only company to have a game this big with a launcher that has the most issues I have ever seen.Most games the launcher would close once it's done it's job right?

2017-07-16,0,0,7,False,Not Recommended,Hey! Look at that. It's a review bomb the only real way you can send a message to a creator for doing something dumb.I haven't been able to play a lot of PC ever since my good computer took a massive dump on me. Because of this I missed out on a lot of that sweet PUBG time I could have had. And now it looks like I won't ever be playing PUBG again be it purchasing a PS4 copy or once I get a working PC again because the dev's are a bunch of s who care more about making money than they do improving the core game.The issue if you didn't know is there are the copycat media that comes popping up whenever something gets popular. PUBG's first big scuffle was with Fortnite and whatever. Nothing really happened or it's still happening behind the scenes. Doesn't really matter. Now PUBG is going after all those tiny little asset flip cashgrabs that go popping up. Why is this such a bad thing for PUBG to do?For one it wastes time and resources that could be spent improving the core game. For two it's just dumb and vague t. They listed their frying pan as an iconic weapon that is somehow unique to their experience. Because PUBG is just really an origonal game filled with origonal ideas that nobody else ever had or implimented.For three one of their justifications is the movie industry has all these wonderful protections for their IP. All this movie IP protection! No parodies or rip offs happen there! None at all. Ever. Nowhere in the world. Two movies of similar or identical premise made by separate studios just don't exist or keep their existence independant of the first movie's creation. And they never will.For three if they somehow won this it could change the entire video game dynamic. It doesn't have nearly the same chance of passing but say we get a ignorant/bad judge. This could do to gaming what a repealed net nuetrality could do to the internet. Again they are suing over the use of a frying pan weapon. Yes among other things but other things of a similairly generic nature. So generic that you can play clips of PUBG alongside your pick of three dozen shooters and you wouldn't know which is which based off anything other than the HUD and lack of NPCs.Because when it boils down to it there is nothing special about PUBG. They are a generic battle royale game that got so amazingly popular just because they were the first one's to do it right and The Culling committed suicide.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-10-12,0,0,518,False,Not Recommended,Easiest way to sum it up is this. Great game terrible devs. The game in itself is really fun for me to duo with friends. It has a great amount of tension when getting into fights just enough to make you really get into it. The problem with the devs is that they are too money driven in getting temporary sales rather than holding a healthy player base constantly. Every update seems to have more issues than fixes and new content combined. They keep adding ar category weapons to the game but not more viable versions of pistol and smg categories to change gameplay slightly. They don t have a interesting permanent game modes like pistols only. Just events that are rushed and temporary. The flare gun should be added as an incredibly rare drop but hasn t yet. What the devs do is drop new crates to get useless items constantly to change appearance in a game that majority play in first person they have no constant free rewards that don t include BP. You want a good game to co op in and just play occasionally then this game is fun but grinding it hard only burns you out if you aren t playing with a close friend and you ll see cool updates maybe 3 times a year,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Meaning that there is alot more action and therefor more fast paste. However it isn't flawless. The game has as of now ( being 2017 12 26 ) been out for quite awhile and the game is still poorly optimized. You may experience rubberbanding and other general types of lag in fact you may actually experience it pretty frequently.It's a great game to play with your friends but it can also be great deal of fun to play on your own. You also have the possibility to make new friends with their integrated duo three man squad and four man squad automatching! All in all it's a great game but there's alot of room for improvment. If youre going to play it alone I'd give it a 6.5/10 due to the lag and the fact that I personally prefer playing it with friends.

2017-09-01,0,0,112,True,Not Recommended,"While I enjoy the core gameplay of PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS the overall experience of the game as well as the people who make it leave a lot to be desired. The game runs very poorly on even higher end PC's requiring the use of very low graphical settings to get a halfway decent framerate. The game is buggy with some rounds having buildings that never fully render and can be walked through or having to reload the main menus UI frequently to be able to queue for games. The development team is also quite concerning due to issues such as claiming there will be no micro transactions in PUBG in the games earlier days and then doing a full 180 when the game became a massive hit and saying that in the release version not only will there be purchasable cosmetics but they will only be obtainable through loot boxes you have to pay for not for free like the current model. This coupled with the fact that PUBG has adopted the very anti consumer practice of loot box drops and gambling for real (at least Steam restricted) money shows that PlayerUnknown is not concerned about people enjoying his game and it's longevity but rather how much money he can quickly squeeze out of this new cash cow. Finally the fact that there are already ""professional"" tournaments being held makes it clear that a final optimized release for PUBG is not the end goal for the dev team. By hosting tournaments already PLAYERUNKNOWN is essentially saying that his vision for the game has been completed and he feels the game is finished enough for the pro scene. This is concerning for the game in the long run since it could potentially mean that if the dev team is comfortable having professional players use their game in its current state with large amounts of money on the line they're okay with releasing the game as a finished product without addressing some or all of its glaring issues. Overall I feel that PLAYERUNKNOWN was not ready for his game to be such a massive hit and because of that he is making shortsighted greedy decisions that harm the players his company and the game itself. I would recommend steering clear at least until some major changes take place.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-02-09,1,1,244,False,Not Recommended,Gotta say it does run decently well now compared to eariler but fortnite runs better and has a more enjoyable experience. This is becuase they have a small map that is very bright and easy to see people and overall the gun fights don't feel clunky and slow. Also the addition of skins like costumes pickaxes etc you can buy straight from the store instead of having a chance to get one in a crate like csgo's loot system. A very bad thing about pubg also is the indistinguishable noises even if someone is very close to me i can't pinpoint their exact location which i can easily do in every other game and it is the result of almost all my deaths in the game. Also there is other bugs and glitches that still haven't been fixed like the vechiles the worst offender being the three wheeled bike which can kill you by flipping for no reason. Also vechiles can get stuck in other vechiles and walls and then blow up which is also frustrating. The thing that made me buy this game in the first place was the fps battle royale gameplay that fortnite doesn't currently have ( because i prefer FPS to TPS ). But i was let down after a while by playing the game and giving it multiple chances after multiple breaks but after every break the game hadn't seemed to improve at all. The final problem i will talk about is the hackers. There are so many even after the massive ban wave. It sucks when you are in the top 5 and one of the guys is just aim hacking and just instantly headshots you without you even moving from your position and him knowing exactly where you are. TLDR basically don't buy it just yet buy it when they make actual changes for the good of the game like actual gameplay mechanics and when they add that new small map to make gameplay more fast paced. hopefull they will do it soon as they said they will do multiple game changing changes in the year and hopefully they do it soon before the Pubg fanbase completely crashes,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-22,0,0,138,False,Not Recommended,"Before you buy this do a search on ""desync"" in PUBG.Played this game with three friends for many hours and we all experienced frequent inexplicable hit detection (or rather the lack thereof). Most nights only one of us had problems but some nights we all had difficulty getting kills despite seeing hits registered in our front end. On the flip side it seemed like other players would just look at us and we'd die. Initially we wrote it off to hackers. Unfortunately the problem seemed to get worse as time went on.Eventually I did some online research and discovered that apparently from the beginning the developers found that the Unreal tournament engine that PUBG is based upon wasn't meant for MMOG and have been working around those limitations since (desync issues). There are plenty of YT videos documenting the problem too.In addition to the unreliable hit detection there are other annoying aspects of the game. There is a ton of emphasis on weapon accuracy different weapons and attachments determine accuracy. But what's glaringly absent is that getting hit by gunfire while firing does nothing to degrade the shooter's gunnery. So if you're getting shot you can continue to shoot without penalty.Another issue is the graphics draw distance. Things like tall grasses block your visibility while prone so you might presume you're not visible to others but if your opponent is far enough away he doesn't see you in the cover of grass you're just lying in the open.But it was the problems we experienced with wonky hit detection that eventually got so frustrating that we stopped playing.If indeed the problem lies with limitations of the Unreal tournament engine there may not even be a fix. If it's hackers then they're not doing enough to stop them.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-06-22,0,0,242,False,Not Recommended,10/10 Do not buy this game at the moment Unless you have a high end PC and 30 to waste. Its addictive but overshadowed by horredous net code networking servers and a unquantifiable level of hacking/cheating. It also appears that the developers are insistent on wigging out and rather than focusing on spending their mountains of money further developing the game they are purely motivated by financial game. There are better free games to play if you want the same experience.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-06-01,0,0,771,False,Not Recommended,"Obviously if you look at my hours I'm not just some random guy who hopped on the game and thought it was terrible just because I couldn't understand it. I have my fair share of gameplay and that is why I'm writing this review I don't write reviews for anything unless I actually know what I am talking about. Here is my thoughts on PlayerUnknown Battlegrounds. At first this game had my eye in fact it had everyone's eye. Everybody in the gaming community knew about this game and the reason a lot of people never ended up getting it was because of the hefty pricetag of $30. The game was thrilling it was exciting it was one hell of a beautiful game. I played this game non stop last year most of my summer was engulfed in this game and I did not stop playing when it came into the school year. I mean I was seriously gaming out. I was loving the BR experience shooting people and strategizing with my teamates. But all of a sudden I hit a massive brick wall. I was getting bored very bored. The fact that I could play 2 matches in an hour (if I won them) was astonishing and not in a good way. The whole time factor itself I think was a massive throwback to a lot of people. Most people just simply did not have the time to enjoy 5 to 10 games of PUBG. If they had an hour they could get in a couple of games but you couldn't really enjoy it because if you managed to make it to the bush camping ending then you realized that it took you 30 minutes to get there. Another problem with the game was the lack of updates I totally understand that this was a game that came out of knowwhere and that it was still in early access but this game was breaking records it was making a ton of money. More money than they could ever have expected to make off of this game in such a short amount of time. During the beginning when it was getting to become the superpower of the BR experience that it was it was getting weekly updates. These updates weren't small either! But as time went on Bluehole was just neglecting the game simply because they did not think they were going to be overtaken (my opinion). As less and less updates came out the community was starting to become reckless. Then in my opinion the bullet to the head for PUBG happened. Fortnite came out with this action packed exciting and VERY fast paced game. Now I'm not saying that it didn't have its fair share of bugs and problems in the beginning (and still does) but it was making its way into the scene while being unheard of. Side note one other massive problem with PUBG was the EXTENSIVE amount of cheaters that were in the game. Yes battleye was getting a lot of the cheaters but it was by far not catching enough. You could almost count on finding a cheater in one of every 3 games. China was a massive problem and I heard that they are finally cracking down on this problem. Anyways back to the main point. Once fortnite came out I was was still sticking to ole' faithful PUBG. It was still keeping me entertained and I did not want to change over to what I thought at the time was the ""Kids"" version of PUBG. So I didn't I kept playing and playing for months I became very good at the game but as they say all good things must come to an end. I think it was around January that I realized I simply just was not having that much fun in the game anymore. I was in desperate need of another thrill seeking (hopefully fast paced) game. I found it in Fortnite and through that game I managed to get everything I needed. EXCLAIMER This is just my opinion i'm not saying that one game is better than the other but it's just what fits me. If you prefer PUBG I totally get it and good for you! Overall I think the main problems to this game were the constant bugs and the lack of updates. I asked a couple of PUBG buddies of mine from back in the day that I see playing other games and most of them said that they got tired of the hackers and the neglect from the developers. This game is a good one but it's on a slow trend downwards it is going to be surpassed by other BR games that are more fast paced and less campy. Once again this is my opinion on the game and I'm just putting it out to the public on how I feel about the game. If you have any thoughts on the review or you disagree definitely leave it in the comments side! I would totally love to hear some feedback from the community. Have a good day!",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-10-18,0,0,237,True,Not Recommended,So tired of this t game. I enjoy this type of game play but how this game is executed is just horrible. I don't write reviews for anything often unless their is a serious issue but this is really getting bad. Servers are horrible with constant lag getting you killed or ruining expierence. Last 10 rounds I ran around for couple minutes straight in high spawn zones just to find a pistol and get killed instantly by someone slingshotting around from the lag and shooting you through walls. This game has got considerably worse since I've bought it and take this review from someone who wins matches often highly. Don't buy this piece of until they finally decide to throw money at it and fix the servers and spawning. Seriously get rid of the useless clothing spawn you're creating unecessary lag spawning that crap in. Cut down on the pistol attachments and less pistols. It makes the game boring.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-10-11,0,0,76,True,Not Recommended,This game feels like it will be in early acces forever. This isnt the first battle royale type game and definitely not the last. Dont buy this .... because they are only adding stuff to the game that makes them rich instead of improving the game in terms of * Performance (Still * Movement (Still and still the animations to get over a fence or basicly any animation still needs implemented)* Still only 1 map and when is the other map coming?This game needs some serious improvement before i will give it a positive review.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-10-14,2,1,621,True,Not Recommended,Honestly probably the best example of a company that has zero incentive to improve their gameplay for the consumers.

2017-10-14,1,1,156,True,Not Recommended,I can no longer recommend what use to be a great game. The hacking has become so severe that nearly everymatch I play I see someone sprinting across the map at 100 mph or I get one shotted by some random asian guy across the map who can see everyones location. The devs have seemingly abandoned the practice of banning the cheaters. Do not buy this game until it is fixed all the devs care about is getting it on Xbox and making more cash before they leave it to die.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-02-11,0,0,82,False,Not Recommended,Stopped playing because Lag issues hitting anyone is impossible. For example you die watch deathcam and see a totally different fight which could have a second of your game play missing. Worst in game physics and mechanics. The clumsiest character controls ever. Gameplay in general you wait 7 minutes of lobby+initial gathering map+plane flying+parachuting to die in a few seconds because you got unlucky with weapons. Most of the time though you get to survive the 1st minute of the game and get the thrill of 20 minutes of looting and running with the zone just to die from a random bullet without ever knowing who killed you. Worse yet you can't know how to use your weapons as there is no single player or training mode where you can learn mechanics and physics of your weapon. Can't create your own server either. So you pretty much waste 5 20 minutes to shoot a couple of bullets and discover that your stuff doesn't work the way you imagined it would. Cheaters. Didn't encounter them that much personally but they are pretty common.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2018-02-11,0,0,428,False,Not Recommended,This game is s$$$! Frist it's not a full release at all it better just be pre alpha. Second every game one of the day will take 5 minutes to load also every so often a random game will crash no matter what pc you have. Then the crash report crashes for some reason. One last thing to say is if your game has a stroke and your playing with friends when you try to reconnect sometimes it won't work so your left out.Thrid is the desync is most of the time your getting killed around walls. The battleflied series and do better then this s$$$. Plus everyone plays on na from all over the world so it doesn't help the desync. (Land lock the servers!)Fourth the sad thing is this game is more fun then Fornite and H1 combind aren't as good as this aids so I'm salved to play it. Fornite and H1 couldn't even have hard a$$$ intercourse and make a better game.Wait until the game is done completely before buying if your that type of guy about those problems.

2017-08-11,0,0,435,True,Recommended,Look they released the crates even though they said no micro transactions but with these crates the people upstairs are going to be making some money they will put towards the game. The Devs have not failed us in most parts yes there are tons of bugs but a lot of these are being fixed all the time. The game is definitely playable and exceptionally fun. It's not pay to win it's skins. If you don't want a shirt that won't really give you an advantage then don't buy one. You can even open a crate get a duplicate sell it and buy a camo shirt off the market. (They only cost about 50 cents the neat looking ones with funky colours that'll get you spotted cost a lot more). Crates you can sell on the market too you can litteraly make money off of the game by playing and then selling a crate. The crates are free to unlock and get in game minus the gamescon one if you want to open it. But it's litteraly an easy way for honest players to make decent steam wallet dough. The next thing is the bans right now. This is the earliest phase of banning and I'm sure they will have an appeal area. If you honked a horn at someone and got banned you will probably get unbanned if you appeal. They're trying to ban the unhonest players and people that are doing bad things right now but a lot of those will getmixed up with honest ones.

It was a waste of money and I'll be completely honest I wish I could get a refund for this. For starters my very first game I had no idea what was going on. I ended up dying to the gas within minutes of playing. Okay fine. Guess I didn't know about how the game worked and I guess I'll try again.Second and onward I no longer die to the gas but then get destroyed by aimbot sporting hackers every few minutes. Not only that but the devs absolutely hate their fanbase. To the point they restrict custom game making to popular streamers. If you wanted to play any of the other game modes you're SOL.

If I'm not getting killed by a player doing 360s across the map with a shotgun my game is crashing with me coming back to the game as dead. If they fix the bugs and get a handle on the hackers I'll recommend this game.

2018-02-12,0,0,230,False,Not Recommended,So after now more then half a year playing this game I have sadly to admit that In my Opinion this Game is garbage. Why ? Let me explain. Physics are way to clunky no explanations what so ever and so far from realistic that it gets such pain in the a***. Dmg of the weapons is just random.. you never know what weapon might be best right now because they all suck. And the last thing I noticed after playing other shooter games again the proportions of this game are so incredebly bad that you cant understand the distances right and you always wrong. Nothing is like real life you have to adjust to this strange looking world just to see thing properly which is just straight annoying. In the end the game makes still fun but not for the long term. The gameplay and everything is really new but after some days or week or even months you will notice that this game isnt about surviving or shooting its about finding the F**** scope ... and this is what this game makes garbage. You always start from scrach and everything is just random. Its like you are playing against Rngesus himself and he always wins.Thats why I also dont see any competetiv potential because you might end up 20min in the game with a UMP without a scope vs. a fully armed shi**head that of course will kill you easily if he isnt or new to the game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Netcode is being updated game has become pretty smooth and Bluehole is bringing a new crate system to the table.

2018-07-07,1,1,153,False,Not Recommended,"I bought this game after the sanhok DLC came out and I cannot recomend this game for a number of reasons.1 ) The devs are trying their hardest to get money out of this game so they can cash out by adding DLCS for updates that should have been free they called it a ""Season pass"" which means these will be happening often for $10 every time.2 ) The lag compensation is god awful if you've come from cs go you know this is something you can't put up with. If you peak some one for 0.1 second and get 1 shot off you will continue to get shot for an entire 2 seconds after you've peaked because the net code is garbage.3 ) RNG At the beginning of the game you won't get a gun. You will be running from house to house looking at bandages and weapon attachments. When you finally get a gun you want you'll realise you can't carry the ammo for it because you don't have a backpack.4 ) Running. The maps are so huge that you will actually spend 10 25 minutes straight just holding shift + W trying to run away from the zone even if you decide to go dead center of the map. Also vehicle spawns are RNG too5 ) Rubber band jumps a less talked about bug but when you have to make a critical jump you have to pray to RNGesus cause every time you are trying to make a life or death jump the game will just teleport you 45 degrees in the wrong direction or teleport you straight down as if you didn't jump at all.If you are looking to get away from cs go don't come here its bad.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-02-23,0,0,33,False,Not Recommended,Not worth the money at the moment.Many hackers and cheaters the problem with chinese players invading the other servers in the world massive perfomance problems even on high spec computers make this game hardly playable. In my opinion the skin market system has to be significantly changed to take away the real money profite cheater get by selling rare skins that drop out of the lootboxes.Forbidding real money skin trading or installing a store where you buy the skins directly from bluehole could be solutions but I don't really know.Now this situation isn't the case only since yesterday no the community is raging for weeks if not months about serious problems and behold today a 5.3gb patch went online. I thought 'hey cool' until I saw the patchnotes. It is really contraproductive if a whole 5.3gb of data contain some goddamn LOOTBOXES . MAN!! I am so !!Anyway until some serious work and effort has been put into fixing those problems the game will lose many players including myself. Maybe someday the positive sides of this game which it undeniably has will overshadow the negative aspects again and make the gameplay experiences somewhat enjoyable again.Cheers,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2018-03-04,1,1,101,False,Not Recommended,"This game is ****ing dog ****. Actually dog **** is probably better as it serves some purpase in fertilizing the ground the dog ****s on. This game is built on a broken engine with an uncountable number of bugs and glitches. I think the dev smashed his head on the keyboard hoping a solided coded foundation would come out and instead he accidentally smashed PUBG into existence. There is no attempt by the dev team to fix the game. Either their code is so seriously flawed that they cannot fix it they do not care and will not fix it or my personal opinion they are not skilled enough to fix it.I normally do not write reviews but this level of incompetence and failure deserves the time and effort. A few problems with this game 1) The main focus is entirely wrong. Do you like finding guns and shooting people winning by pure skill alone? Well **** off this game is not for you. The game is deviod of loot. The odds of you finding a gun in the first 3 houses you loot are slim. The major problem with this is you will spend most of the game searching for a weapon med kits boosts etc... instead of actually getting into firefights. This game is really fun when you are engaged in a fight with someone else that is well geared. This rarely happens. Most fights are one sided with someone lucky enough to find gear and the other standing with his/her thumb of their ***. This problem with loot is the core of all other problems. The devs do not seem to think this is a problem so if you like mastochistically waiting in a lobby over and over again just to hope you get lucky next game well then this game is for you. This game will never be fixed as long as the devs think loot does not fun.2) Lobby get rid of it. Why do I need to wait a ****ing minute to play the game when after 5 seconds there are 90+ player ready to start. Start the ""game' so I can roll the dice and maybe find loot but most likely just die and sit in a lobby again. I know why this time exist. It is so the complete **** engine can load in the rest of the map. But not loot......the game will absolutely not render in loot.3) Map design It's great except for a few major exceptions. The map is massive which is a good thing for a 100 person battle royale. However good loot only spawns in major city hubs and other similiar location. If you aviod these places you will not find any game winning loot. This leads to the entire server landing in a few location killing each other within the first 1 2 minutes and then the rest of the game is a waiting/looting sim until the circle forces the last remaining players to fight. Also good luck finding a vehicle. If you do not then have fun playing running simulater because thats all you will be doing. Endlessly running and looting buildings without any loot. Don't forget to pick up the fingerless gloves though because those are clearly essential to enjoying the game. This could be solved by making loot more prevelent. Everyone finds some gear (although maybe not your ideal kit) and then proceeds to fight. Since loot would be more prevelant. players would not feel any special attachent to an AR or SR and would not worry about losing it. However currently finding necessary loot for the average player is very rare. This leads to players camping simply because they find something that they know they will not find for another 10+ games even if they are lucky. Optics are also a huge issue. Because the maps are so large having optics is a deciding factor. See issue one above if you are curious about finding optics. Any player which is most unlucky enough to not find optics will not be able to win the 100+ meter engagements. So players endlessly loot for a 4x or 8x scope never find it and ultimatly lose the endgame to the one or two people that find optics. Lack of optics creates an unfair advantage to the few players luck to find them.4) Severs they plugged a couple of hard drives into a Macintosh 128K because they couldn't afford the potatoes. Good luck getting a stable connection.5) Optimization Just purely terrible. There seems to be no attempt by the dev team to make this garbage run on any system. Maybe it's a hint from the dev team that everyone is missing ""we tried so hard to make this tech demo unplayable and yet you guys still keep buyint it. Please stop we have no idea what we are doing. Thanks for the money though"". If you like placing your crosshairs directly on a players head two feet in front of you and somehow missing then you will love this game. If you like FPS games with inconsistency then you have found the best way to spend your money. If you like quality games that have consistenly fair outcomes well do not buy PUBG. Update Recently the devs have spent time and resources adding more and more items to the in game shop such as weapon skins/clothing and an emote wheel in a recent update instead of optimizing the game. Thier priorties seem pretty clear.6) Sound This game will make you want to unplug your speakers/headphones. You may be better off deafly guessing where you are getting shot from than relying on the absolutely horrible audio. Sound in this style of game is extemely important and they really messed it up. I cannot believe any game developer could make a game with audio this bad. I honestly cannot think of a game I've played with worse audio. Enemy locations and bullet directions feel almost entirely randomly generated. Someone is on the floor below you? Well don't be surprised when that player pops around the corner in the room next to you or comes from a floor above or is even ouside. Getting shot from behind to the left to the right in front? This is how every firefight will sound. Every enemy is apparently in a superposition of every possible direction firing at you. Watch the death cam and be amazed. It really is a complete guessing game. Directional audio is nonexistent it's just sound effects in random directions for the sake of having sound.This is only a few problems that I can think of off hand after a game session. There are plenty more that I am sure other reviewers have criticized.I have a brother that lives in California and a friend that recently moved far away. I live on the East Coast. It can be difficult to find time to talk with them. I play this game with them every Sunday and talk on discord. Since this game is mostly running looking for nonexistent loot sitting in the lobby for an excessive amount of time and waiting for circles it is the perfect background noise to spend time and chat. This is the only reason I play. I would never play this game without them. It simply is not enjoyable. I wish my brother had better taste in games and would play something that didn't give me cancer but it is what it is. This game is realy just cancer being marketed a ""entertainment"". Do not buy this game. Save your money and time. Save yourself the regret of a terrible purchase that cannot be deleted from you library that just serves as a constant blaring reminder of the money and time you lost. This may be the worst game I have ever purchased. It could be great but I doubt the stubborn incompetent developmnet team will ever provide customers with a satisfying product. In the current state (prediction and years after this reveiw) this game should be labeled as ""In Alpha"" or ""In Alpha with no attemt to enter Beta"" or more honestly as ""Complete Failure"".",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-10-16,0,0,1694,False,Not Recommended,"Amazing game at the core but the absurd business practices poor server management and ludicrous number of cheaters makes it a waste of money for now. Any time you see news that says ""cheaters are rare..."" just know they have not played the game for more than 100 hrs. I frequently run into speed hackers aimbotting invulnerability no recoil etc. I really hope they address these issues in the future. Adding a share/screeshot button that also saved the last 30s of gameplay would provide all of the evidence we needed to get the people permabanned. Edit. Leaderboards were not hacked it was just chinese cheaters farming bp. Currently can't get more than 2 games with out getting instakilled headshot from accross the map. One was full auto uzi from over 100m and never missed a heatshot while I was running. It's getting to the point where you might as well not even try if you see people's names with tonnes of digits.Edit Nov. 22. Same cheater 2 games in a row.Edit Jan/6/2018 new death cam reveals 10x more cheaters than previously thought. People that have cheats for finding you accross the map more aimbotting aim overlays. I'm having guys hipfire kar98 M24 etc. while i'm in a car through the trees and landing 100% headshots. It doesn't get any more blatant than that. 1.5 million banned? with the same 1.5 millon still in their cushy pubg item farming chinese cheater group selling items and ruining the game.Edit January 15 2018 Every single game I played today had blatant cheaters. Shooting through mountains shooting through buildings barrels etc. There is no game to play right now.Edit February 3 2018 First game I play of the day an enemy player drives up to the building I am in looks directly where I am hidden through all of the walls decides how best to kill me by switching betweeen weapons grenades etc. Finally decides to just rush me comes around corner aims at crate I am behind I pop out hit him a dozen times with a fully equipped M4 and he then aims at the wall and headshots me several times. Region Lock China!Edit September 9 2018 As bad as it has ever been. Last season I finished 138 in NA. Now i would say 99/100 games I play has a minimum of 5 cheaters in it. People are now using ESP hacks which allow you to see all other players at all times. I have been edified by the report system with the reports suggesting that the account has been perma banned. Nearly impossible to win unless the hackers accidently get killed. Region Lock China!!!Edit October 8th 2018 Now you get auto matched to the den of cheating lions itself. The land of a billion cheaters. I can't get a game on an NA server. Thanks you managed to take a game from bad to worse to this....I don't have the vocabulary to properly describe how you guys are but this was the last straw. I want a refund. Pretty sure I should still be under my time.Edit November 19 2018 Nothing has improved. ""Fix PUBG"" has done nothing to fix PUBG. I report people get confirmation ""ChineseHacker******"" has been permanently banned but when they can just go to the next internet cafe over why bother. Clearly the players are using some form of IP workaround to play in NA. So frustrating.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-06-11,4294967295,1,74,True,Recommended,"MicrotransactionsFirstly the main reason for all the bad reviews on the game are due to the implementation of microtransactions. To be clear these transactions are only for cosmetic items and iv'e heard its linked to a charity event and all procceeds from said event go to charity. These microtransactions are entirely optional and are in no way forced onto players it does not effect the game really at all in its current implementation. I would understand the upset if these items gave a pay to win advantage but they are only cosmetic.ReviewNow the infomation of microtransactions is out of the way I can proceed onto the rest of the review. Firstly I will go over the positives of the game and then a few negatives.1) Map The current map is very well detailed and textured there are a variety of locations which are all different such as the military base shipping yards a prison and so on. This means the map isnt repetitive despite being the only map currently and is also recognisable so people who play it often can gain an advantage.2) First person mode The new first person mode is excellent and in my opinion is far better than the standard mode but this is down to personal preference but im glad the developers have allowed the option to play in first person mode only. I prefer this mode since it is more 'realistic' and tactical since you can not see around walls and just camp in houses for the full game. Some people might like the third person but I personally much prefer the first person only mode.3) Spawn System The path of the plane is diferent meaning you can not just spawn in the same place each time which helps make the games different even on one map. It also introduces a new level of tactics by having to choose a spawn location one which has loot but also balances risk of running into other players. 4) Banning policy This has been quite debated recently but I agree with the idea of banning team killers and people who are overally abusive in lobbies and so on but I don't think its clear enough what certian rules mean since ive read about people being banned for ""stream sniping"" by just going after a person who happens to be streaming. So I think its great the devs are trying to stop cheating / hate in the game but they need to be careful with reviewing evidence as to not ban the wrong people.5) More maps could be added since currently there is only one map but the devs have said 2 more maps are work in progress which is great news.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2018-01-03,0,0,257,False,Recommended,Quite a fun game after it came out of early access the fps dramatically increased and I love you for that but this has to be said It is claimed that there has been 1.5 million hackers banned from the game yet I still encounter quite a lot of blatant hackers in most of my games that being around 1/3 games I play. And that is not an overexaggeration. This game is really fun and I really enjoy it the mechanics are good the way the maps are designed are great for gunfights. The ONLY thing that lets it down for me are hackers. Another thing I have noted is that there are a lot of chinese people playing in EU servers and this is annoying as they have a higher ping so they are harder to hit as they lag around quite a lot please fix this and make it so you have to be under a certain ping to play in a certain region.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-04-08,0,0,174,True,Recommended,I wish I could give an 'ok' ratingit's not worth $30 but I would have been satisfied if I'd picked it up on sale at about $10 or even $15it kind of feels and plays like a simplified arma where you jump out of a plane and land somewhere on an enormous map either solo in a duo or a 4 man team. You then scavenge weapons and armor and fight everyone else. There are shotguns M4s M16s Kar 98k Scar AKM SKS pistols revolvers some sniper rifles and random sights to mod weapons with three tiers of armor and helmets bandages and backpacks and some other random stuff.You pick this stuff up in multiple buildings (which is what you will spend most of your time doing walking around and picking up stuff) and walk or drive one of 3 vehicles from town to town (sedan buggy jeep also boat). That really is most of the game.the unique conceit is that the map sector in which you are allowed to play without being auto damaged for being out of bounds gets progressively smaller culminating in close combat at the end at least in theory.in practice everyone jumps out around the same spot or the same couple of large towns kills each other off pretty quickly most of your teammates will be rutardz/no mic and then that one team that actually plays together will just be camping the final zone.It also means that the best way to play in terms of how to win is also the most boring way to play which is kind of bad game design at the very core. What I mean is that you win by surviving to the end of the match and the best way to do that is to quickly grab whatever weapon you can and then run and hide for 20 minutes avoiding large towns and other players. Getting a car and hiding under a tree until the zone closes in more and then moving to stay within it and hiding under another tree is the way to survive/win whereas actually fighting generally gets you killed almost immediately (100 other players so it doesn't really matter how good you are at 3rd person shooters you're gonna die).Health is lowish so whoever sees the other person first pretty much gets the drop and wins.It is pretty fun but after a few evenings I'd say I'm close to done with it.I imagine it's a lot better if you have a 4 person group or even one other reliable person to play with online with mics. *after playing with a team with everyone on mics the same people a few games in a row I can confirm that it is indeed better but the same problems still apply. The game is mostly walk/drive around pickup stuff and eventually get caught out by someone/group you didn't see who kills you all in a few seconds. The result is long periods (5 25 minutes) of monotonous walking/pilfering simulator punctuated by brief (as in a few seconds) and deadly combat that is most often over before you even know what happened. The boring action ratio is pretty bad. The game does have a certain 'just one more match' feel to it though and if you like the people you are on with it's pretty fun as an elaborate chat room.I'm open to changing to a positive review score if things improve a bit or the price drops but for now I would not recommend at $30.Although I'm probably still gonna keep playing it some so...*I've decided to change my review to positive because it is pretty good if you get a decent team on Mics especially for early access and because I have played it for 10 hours which is only $3/hour for entertainment so I'd consider that a good deal. The core problem with the game being most effectively played in ways that are boring still remains though.#waitingintheboat,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

As a gamer in his 20s I thought i'd never find another game that captured my attention and dedication as much. But i guess i was wrong.However things that seriously need to be fixed before i recommend this game to anyone 1. Fall damage Dying from jumping out of a car that is going 30 MPHs is absolutely ridicules. That won't even happen in real life. Much less should it happen in a video game where every ounce of health counts.2. Game closing spontaneously This is absoutely unacceptable and ruins the immersion and can be quite frustrating.3. Items stuck in game structures Care package items stuck in the seabed. 4. Getting stuck in world structures when dropping This is another annoyance. Sometimes you land on building and literally fall through it. It's jaw droppingly stupid and should be fixed asap.5. Random lag Random lag in middle of a gunfight lag when jumping lag everywhere lag when looting.Fixing this aswell will greatly improve the gameplay. I'll recommend this game when these issues are fixed.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-06-09,0,0,1695,False,Not Recommended,"TL DR at bottomWhat can i say about this game.. i really do love this game and i play it regularly.. having close to 1500 hrs. i am confident that i have a good understanding of the game. that said i really cannot recommend this game to new players and that sucks to say. at its core PUBG is a great shooter that scratches an itch for me like no other shooter does or ever really has. the gun play is probably the best i have ever experienced and strives for a hyper realism that largely hits its mark. over all the game has come a long way with optimization and gameplay mechanices since launch. that said when it boils down to it the game ultimately fails in terms of server performance and net code with the desync and hit registry being some of the worst i have ever experienced in any game and it doesnt seem to matter how good your ping is as mine usually rests at 26ms and i still find myself being shot through walls or getting domed sometimes as long as 2 seconds after i have ducked back behind cover in a fire fight. then on the other hand there are multiple times where one could be aiming at a target and know with out a doubt that your shots should be hitting and they do not and all you see is bullets passing through your target then they turn and focus you. while i will grant that the devs have acknowledged that this is an issue but they have not done anything about it in a long time nor have they seemed inclined to try witht he last fix being that they uped they amount of recieved server packeds on the client side from 12 to 60 kb/s which was months ago way before the ""fix PUBG"" initiative was a thing. and on that topic the ""Fix PUBG"" has not had substantial fixes and some fixes are out right pointless. to quote PC update 21 ""SANHOK FIX #04 Fixed the issue where on the Sanhok map the character occasionally falls from the sky when situated at the very end of the sea."" ""CHARACTER MOTION #03 Fixed the issue where after exiting the game while armed the character model would appear to shake""many fixes have been of this nature where they are not essential and really do not improve game play in any meaningful way dont get me wrong im fine those kinds of fixes being implemented... EVENTUALLY but those are more of the type of fix thats been made AFTER the major issues have been handled. that said WHO THE SWIMS TO THE EDGE OF THE OCEAN AND GIVES A FLYING ABOUT THAT KIND OF BUG ANY WAY. honeslty im convinced that ""Fix PUBG"" is more so an attempt to pull the wool over our eyes because they are merely saying that they're fixing the game so the idiots will believe it and/or the more discerning players might lay off for a bit on pointing out real game breaking issues. as stated i really do love this game i want desprately for it to succeed and be around for as long as possible but i dont see that being the case with how inept the devs have proven themselves to be with the games bigger issues .TL DRPUBG is a great shooter with fun mechanics but it falls short with server lag and desync regarless of connection fidelity making most matches utterly horrible experiences.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

A quick search on Google will give you a hint of what you can expect.I mean there are some good players yes and unless you have a good computer a good connection and play it on a daily basis you won't evolve and you'll become bait )But the amount of people cheating is impressive. Can't count the times I've seen through the death cam shots with 0 recoil on an AKM (lol...) aiming 2m to right or left or the aiming snapping to target each and every shot!Game is poor in terms of performance has more bugs than an ant farm but in overall is good fun as I said.If it wasn't for the cheaters I would recommend it...

Besides the annoyance that is its impossible to keep the servers for the rightful people the gun play is great not perfect as sometimes it feels like your reticle is nowhere near where you're hitting regardless of distance or recoil control but overall great. Fire fights can be frustrating though. I've had multiple games where you hit them for ages without even knocking them down only to get shot only in the head from miles away while zig zagging like a mad man.

They have already gutted the shotguns the AK47 and are planning on nerfing the SKS all in the effort of making guns inflexible for the sake of fulfilling video game tropes of the guns. Currently the S12K shoots out bullets in a 45 degree funnel and is impractical past 1 foot. Too bad this will turn out like CS which is already an awful game in part to the only viable guns being the AR's and the obscenely powerful AWM.The new patch will have vaulting and it seems a bit broken. Most 2 storey houses already have 2 points of entry on the bottom floor and another 2 on the top floor. and it is difficult enough to track players moving in and out of them in a combat situation. Vaulting lets people move past previously unpassable windows making the game turn into a giant game of peekaboo.They are adding in air resistance and damage dropoff for the sake of realism but all it will do is long range engagements non existant.

2018-02-08,0,0,130,False,Not Recommended,"TLDR I've spent 30 hours of match time (157 matches) to kill 27 enemies. I'll do the math for you Let's say a kill is ten seconds of tension and action on average (and I'm being generous here). That's a total of less than five minutes. The rest is 29 hours and 55 minutes of parachuting running looting buildings swimming driving and standing waiting. Also add 2 hours and 37 minutes waiting in the pre match area. That sums up to * 2 5 % action* 97 5 % transportation and lootingDo I complain because I'm a lousy PvP player? Yes.Does this came crash a a lot? Yes.Long versionRemember Counter Strike? Remember the action? Rember the music in Battlefield Vietnam? Remember the dense jungle and rain in Vietcong and in ARK SotF? And the PvE elements to die from in ARK SotF? Imagine removing the action removing the music removing the dense forest removing all weather effects and removing the PvE elements. Also remove the variety of maps. Then add distance time and vanity items. There you go you have Playerunknown's Battlegrounds.If you want to be creative look elsewhere. This game is not for you. But if you want to do exactly the same boring thing the same way everybody's doing it and do it over and over again trying to be get faster at it with a hope of getting better at it than someone else this might be for you.Be prepared though You'll walk and walk and and swim and walk and never see an enemy. Then you'll die.You'll move around to be harder to hit. You'll be spotted shot and you'll die.You'll stay still to not be spotted so easily. Then you're spotted shot and you die.You'll spot an enemy shoot be spotted yourself sniped and you die.You'll fill an unarmed unprotected dude with two mags of lead in a small room his mate will throw in a grenade the dude will survive but you'll die.Because you're awful at PvP.AnnoyancesThere's a pointless starting area where you wait until the match begins. This where you'll hear people (read males) express their philosophical views in life mainly using one syllable noises.What you won't hear in the game are enemies approaching (unless they're in a car or they're shooting) 15 meters away two guys running with full gear and you're standing still nope not a sound. So much for realism. And note this is despite the lack of sound of weather like rain or wind.Because yeah there's no change in weather. Nor day night cycle for that matter. Just boring daylight.There are no forests. Just vast fields with a few trees. To like not hide behind.There's water to swim in. Hurrah. Transportation! Or take a boat! More transportation! You can swim to the bottom of the lake. There's no point in this. At all. Other than to commit suicide when you hate your life.You can not use a gun punch your opponent. You have to switch to the frying pan or whatever if you bothered picking up something like that.Anyway there's not much close combat to speak of unless you survive to the very end of a match or take a gamble and parachute to a popular site. It's just not that type of game. If you don't have a scope you're pretty much screwed at some point.The career statistics menu option defaults to Solo TPP. It does not take into account that you've played for example Duo FPP for the last three hours.Play solo FPP. Match ends (you die). Click Start. Bang now you're in TPP. Thanks game.There's no way to practice anything other than in a live game. So you can't get any better just playing around with a friend or two you have to play on a server with a shrinking map.Good stuffThe graphics. Appropriately semi realistic.The sound effects (that exists).Bugs ...Just to give you an idea of the quality of the production.In general frequent crashes/freezes.After launching the game application I always (!) have to alt tab back to the Steam client to make the game show the game menu instead of a black screen. Furthermore if I don't do this within a certain time the game will be set in a ""Not authorized"" mode not being able to reconnect (to multiplayer server?) and the ""Restart lobby"" thing does not help.When loading the very first match (every time!) in a session I don't see the starting ground nor the plane flying over the combat area. Instead I see a loading screen (without any loading animation) but hear the sounds of the game (if no sound is heard the game application has stopped responding completely and has to be restarted). Then when the plane reaches the end of the combat area and I'm thrown out the game responds and show the graphics and I can play.Sometimes when I leave a match I end up in the starting ground like if a new game has started only you're all alone.After the update Jan 25 2018 nothing happens sometimes when you try to start a match (the matchmaking message does not pop up). Also equipping items before starting a game causes the message ""An error occurred"".If the game application crashes for a team member and a match starts before he's started it again you'll end up with him appearing as an enemy even though he's on your team.In one variant when you crash and restart you're dead and get to choose to spectate your team mate but what you actually get to see is a view from your dead body as it seems.Occasionally server connection timeouts.If you play in windowed mode and alt tab to another application your mouse pointer is restricted to PUBG's window frame but in the other application.ConclusionWith so many complaints why do I play this game? I do enjoy to team up with a friend when it comes to PvP. So it's a social thing more than anything else. (I've tried playing solo and it's a nightmare.)",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I uninstalled then reinstalled I changed files to admin I checked that all the files were there through Steam I repaired all the C++ files. I searched through every single community forum I checked all official posts. I really wanted to play this game but it just wouldn't work so I have to get a refund. When I looked for maybe a support page from either Steam or PUBG all I could find was a link to forums.

2017-04-19,1,1,133,False,Recommended,Concept wise I wouldn't say that PUBG does anything truly special or remarkable that differs it from the other Battle Royale games. However its jank isn't as jarring as literally every other title in the genre that came before it. Level design animations gunplay UI and visual feedback in general are far from perfect and still have a way to go but they are in a whole another league when compared to the likes of H1Z1 and those things alone are able to deliver a much better experience.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-06-20,0,0,21,False,Not Recommended,I've encountered this game just like 99 9% of it's player base did by watching Twitch streams and youtube videos.Being something relatively new in the multiplayer scene (THAT ACTUALLY HAD A MASSIVE PLAYER BASE) I managed to talk few of my friends into playing it.I'm not going to lie we've spent hundreds of hours on it.That was until the official release of 1.0Keep in mind that we're talking about previously most played game in the world at some point a game which brought it's developers millions (if not 10 digit numbers) and as any sane person you'd expect that it will be poured into further development and fixes right?LOL wrong. We're talking about Bluehole here.You really have to be next level special in order to stumble upon a gold mine and then proceed to blow it up and cave it in. They had everything massive FREE ADVERTISEMENT (NOTE FREE &gt NOT REQUIRED TO PAY FOR) in a form of Twitch streamers and YouTube content creators insane ACTIVE player base a product that's close to being 1.0 ready... Everything.They got money they got everything. And what do they do? In game purchases.It's disgusting seeing that someone who had all the foundation required to make a masterpiece ignore all that and just attempts to drain more money from players.They rushed the 1.0 to be able to implement in game purchases and instead of actually WORKING on it what do they do? More platforms.Not only that none of the platforms performed remotely well they completely ignored that fact and started working on more crates and more in game purchases.Since I could go about this all day long and considering I'm actually rating a game here and not it's thirsty developer I'll focus on it now Pros Fast queue times due to high player base SOLID graphics. Good ballistics (Sniper and AR bullet drop)Cons Fully released game with performance of an early alpha game. HACKERS HACKERS EVERYWHERE! My God I've played so many games but I've never encountered a game with so many hackers in it. Nearly every game contains at least 2 3 hackers which at this point don't even try hiding it. Bluehole is doing nothing to fix this issue despite saying they are. Over the time I've seen NO improvements in this domain. Countless game breaking bugs (getting killed by nothing when vaulting getting stuck in thin air while landing resulting in getting killed reloading sometimes doesn't reload your weapon at all resulting in getting killed...) HORRIBLE performance issues (High end PC users can be happy if they hit constant 60fps on medium high settings at all times) Hilarous netcode. So many instances when you get killed by someone who didn't even have a line of sight constant stuttering 60%+ fail rate of reconnecting to the game in case of a disconnect. Horrible bullet detection system (this one mostly affects Shotguns) level design. This one is a great issue mostly focused on the Miramar map. They forced a new map which is massive in terms of size but ironically has least content least quality looting area a MASSIVE LACK of vehicles considering the proportions of the map (mostly resulting in you playing a running simulator for about 20 minutes and ending up getting killed by someone who had luck with the initial safe zone). Even though the original map is better they still need to prevent bridge camping which makes the game impossible if you had bad luck with initial looting and safe zone. Performance bugs and glitches. Here I don't aim for graphics and design glitches I am talking about glitches which straight up make you lose games. For instance since the latest patch I can no longer run for more than 3 seconds without my character stopping for no obvious reason. (And no this isn't caused by my internet connection or my PC it's a common issue nowadays) I will stop with Cons for now since there's only so much time I can waste on this review. But yes there are way more.################Bottom line if you haven't already bought this game DO NOT. Save your money. There are better alternatives if you're just taking up a new game and they're even free to play. They don't have some of the mechanics PUBG has and that's a shame but at least they're optimized. Keep in mind that this game requires over the average PC to even be able to start the game let alone play it properly.MESSAGE TO THE DEVELOPERS If by any chance SOME of the brainiacs with influence in development actually take time and look through reviews for constructive criticism Stop bullying Epic Games just because they did a better game than you did. How can you be such sore losers if your business logic is to sue someone just for delivering a better product?Instead of suing them focus on your own game. You wouldn't lose any players if you just fixed your god damn game. I tried playing Fortnite and I disliked it but I am going to quit PUBG if things don't change as I'm no longer able to enjoy the game. It's common sense that just one guy ranting here wont mean a thing to you but I'm just one of the many who share this opinion. If anything WE should be the ones getting compensated from YOU for failing to deliver a proper product which we paid for. Just imagine buying a Ferrari (Which you probably did with the money which obviously wasn't poured into additional development) and you're presented with a Ferrari which runs on a Prius engine. You'd obviously be mad as hell and demand your money back...This is not a dead game yet there's still time to fix it but not the way you're running things.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-10-13,0,0,158,False,Recommended,Hello everyone and welcome to IGN today we will be reviewing Playerunknowns Battlegrounds.Playerunknowns Battlegrounds or PUBG for short is a simulation that puts 100 likeminded people on an island the objective of the simulation is to find out what these 100 people will do to each other. Research and reports of the simulation has proved that the sole intent of the people who are placed on the island is to kill each other. Instead of building a civilization the people who are placed on the island want to brutally murder each other with an assortment of weaponry. As an game journalist for 1 week now and one of IGN's lead writers i think that this game is alot like Dark Souls in that it is very difficult and unforgiving for both its players and their computers (of course i have to name here the fact that the game is also available on the microsoft Xbone KEK).Overall the game is quite good as an experienced relatable gamer from IGN who was able to finish Cupheads tutorial level after a week i give this game a very respectable solid rating of 9.5/10. An almost flawless experience. Also thank you for the generous sponsorship from the PUBG corporation that helped this review be possible.For everything related to Playerunknowns Battlegrounds stay right here on IGN.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-09-07,1,1,10,True,Recommended,This game is incredibly simple.You parachute down into the map run from house to house in search of guns and gear and hope to kill along the way while avoiding the same.There is no stamina or hunger meters and I almost love it for the fact. It's a primal game of hunting others in hopes of being the victor and it doesn't claim to be anything more. I can appreciate that.Is it worth 30 dollars? Probably not but I got the game as a gift and it's a pretty ok time sink.My only complaint is that my framerate crashes into the single digits if I run it on anything other than ultra low graphics and even then it's fidgety. My computer is not bad in any sense so it seems to be more of a server/network issue. Other than that it's relatively bug free. The graphics of this game are not intense... they remind me of a PS2 game. If you're a stickler for cutting edge visuals this is probably not the game for you lolIf the price was lowered it was optimized and gameplay improved (not necessarily through stamina etc but gamemodes more unlockables etc) It'd be a hearty recommendation.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Much more fun with friends and discord/teamspeak for comms. The annoying part about the luck is when you spawn near people in a group of houses and you get a house and the guy next to you gets an smg and rushes you...

2017-11-26,0,0,621,False,Not Recommended,"At the time of this review I have 620 hours spent on this game.When I started playing PUBG it was a lot of fun and something new. Getting to top 2 was nerve wracking as you wanted to get that first chicken dinner. After the first win everything changes. You start to notice all the flaws all the bugs and that developers don't care about making this game fun anymore. All they care about is money at this point. Buy keys to open crates buy new cosmetic items that have no value in the game buy emotes buy name changes organise tournaments when the game still has game breaking bugs and etc.The funniest part is the updates. The devs want to force you to play some maps over others. They add new content to only 1 map they take away map select then after community tries to fight it they add the map select back but with choices only to play Erangel/Miramar or Sanhok. Today you can only choose either play all maps or play only one you can't choose 2/3. The game has lots of bugs performance issues and what did the devs do with todays update? ""Buy a name change buy an emote!"". Some of the bugs are still present from the release of the game like cars clipping into walls and exploding and that is sad. The playing experience is also not interesting anymore. Jump &gt loot for an hour &gt die to someone camping in a shed or a hacker &gt start again.I played this game in early access and I thought that player unknown will do something unique with this game as he stated that he made it to be fun. It's not fun anymore. Now I personally only play it because my friends like it who haven't spent much time with it yet. And even they are talking that it got boring in first 100 hours.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

In my eyes BlueHole could do nothing wrong because this was the're first game and I hoped improvements were coming with all the financial gains they have made in their first year. But stuff has only gotten worse. In the beginning it was fun to play for loot and for rank but with all the crates with (PAID) keys you cant open and with all the hackers in every game both aren't fun anymore. The game feels like an empty shell these days with BlueHole milking every last penny from their game. developer updates and a monetization system.

2018-06-11,0,0,794,False,Not Recommended,"I have to say I think I'm done with this game and it's frankly shameful that it took this long.Summary It's a shooting game where for some people bullets simply don't register so it takes 10 15 shots in the head and body to kill people and about 3 shots to be killed.The maps are huge so there is an emphasis on long range sniping only for some people that's impossible because you get shot before the other person is even peeking on your screen and take damage about half an hour after you got behind cover despite your packets sent being 130/s and packets received being 60/s with a ping of between 10 and 30.Stealth and hunting is a huge part of succeeding in this game only for some people the footstep sound effects are either incorrect or completely absent meaning that an entire team of four could literally sprint into the building you're in with zero sound.Speaking of teams...Unbelievably stupid players in random squads. Literally unbelievable. The number of times people will either land completely separated from eachother (sometimes opposite corners of the map) or just drift apart whilst looting and get picked off one by one is nothing short of surreal. And by that I mean it happens in every single game. And if by some utter fluke they survive the first few minutes they will almost always pick a pointless long range fight with people that are no threat which always ALWAYS end in one of two ways They either get killed by the people they're shooting or get killed by the 30 teams drawn to the noise. These scenarios are so familiar that I basically just sigh and occasionally stop playing at that point rest my chin on my fist and wait for the inevitable ""player's bar turned red"" signal that they've been downed too far away to save surrounded by enemies usually followed by a verbal exchange that goes something along the lines of""Ey yellow elp me I am in safe come elp me pliz""""I can't help you the people that shot you are still there looking at you and shooting at me every time I move from behind this rock.""""Elp me I safe why you not elp me I safe!""""You're not safe you're crouched behind a thin tree in a completely open field because you started a fight with no cover."" Rest of team dies "" YOU YELLOW!!! WHY YOU NOT SAFE US ALL!"""" Sighs ""Seriously it's surreal how many times different people are making the exact same mistakes as eachother. I made a mistake too though I paid 26.99 for an amateur made Unreal engine 4 mod then wasted nearly 600 of my frankly far too precious hours ""playing"" it. Hours that could've been spent in infinitely more fulfilling ways such as watching cartoons whilst tossing popcorn at my ing forehead.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Complaints from a lot of people are Too many hackers Not enough new contentI strongly disagree with both of those statements as they are constantly trying to fix the hacker problem and when they spend most of their time doing that people complain there is not enough content (which there is (at least more than fortnite))I don't want to sound as a person who is just trying to hate on fortnite for no reason as I have spent enough time in both games to conclude that PUBG is in fact better than fortnite.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

It has been in my library for quite awhile.The only thing that is frustrating with it is that once you're dead you're dead. All that loot gone. But that is a part of what makes this a fun one.

I reccomend this game to anyone who wants to have a great time in PUBG. If you are debating wether to buy pubg or have bought it but you don't like it because ""you're bad"" then get better lol You need to atleast play 100 hours on this game to be decent in my opinion. If you're just starting off I'd reccomend that you play a few solo games practice looting quickly and testing guns you like and fit your playstyle then play some squads make friends and enjoy yourself. If you don't fancy playing squads just stick to going solos and blasting Russian hardbass in the aeroplane Omegalul. I've noticed that alot of people say there's too many hackers in pubg and people shoot through walls It's buIlshit I've never expericed anything like this people are probably getting high ping and lagging which causes them to stay in one place for a certain amount of time until your ping is reduced. I've spent quite a bit of money on this game especially on shroud Skins and keys I reccomend you just buy the skins of the community market and the keys as well much cheaper.

This developer has a real issue with releasing content and different platform versions and not taking care of the issues and bugs that have been around since day one (platform one for that matter). Then when they do make ""fixes"" they just take all the things that have never been an issue and turn that to trash as well. And a VERY nice job not introducing those microtransactions until the game is complete. Seriously though we ask for REAL fixes we get thrown some new cosmetics... Really? Garbage developers garbage game. Let's not even get STARTED on the streamer favoritism/catering (don't you dare even honk!). What a joke. Step it up or you're going to die out PUBG. Very soon. Honestly as much of a garbage game as it ALSO is save yourself the money download Fortnite. Atleast their servers aren't garbage and the game doesn't crash and bug out. AND FOR THE SAKE OF EVERYTHING GAMING... REGION LOCK THESE ING SEVRERS! EDIT (6/22/18) So the one thing they did right was add in map selection in a previous update. You could finally be spared from playing that abortion of a desert map. Since then in the latest update they have removed it. Ever go to a funeral and watch them screw the lid of the casket down to seal it for eternity? Yeah that's what they just did. So long and good riddance PUBG... EDIT (9/11/18) Came back to check on this dead horse after the most recent updates. They realize their game is in trouble and their playerbase has dropped below 1M finally yet somehow just somehow the ""Servers are too busy please try again later."" Enough said. EDIT (10/3/18) ""FIX PUBG"" Apparently this means with things that are not an issue and ignore the real problems. So now that the sound is ""optimized"" (not even mentioned in patch notes) you can't even hear the game on full volume. What in the honest are you dumb doing there at bluehole? Are you even trying anymore? This game is about to get STEAMROLLED by COD BO4. EDIT (11/20/18) As I suggested above they ed the game up worse than it was. LOL! Declared FIX PUBG a ""Success"" huh? What did you even do except release skins and up the sound programming? Honestly? I have more severe frame drops than I ever had before now that the game is ""Fixed"". And what exactly should we expect from this ""2019 Roadmap""? More skins? More maps? More dumb for mobile and console versions?

2017-04-11,0,0,94,True,Recommended,PLAYERUNKNOWN S BATTLEGROUNDS is a high tension last man standing shooter game that is currently in early access development but has already earned over $11 million dollars and sold over a million copies.Brendan PlayerUnknown Greene began the games life as a mod called Battle Royale for the Arma series of hardcore infantry combat simulators. PlayerUnknown also helped bring to life H1Z1 King of the Kill another extremely popular survival shooter game.After selecting your game mode you will find yourself in a lobby with up to 100 other players. You will soon be fighting to the death against all of them either solo as a duo or a squad of four.The game begins in a plane flying over a remote island in a random direction you must choose a landing place and race to loot the area for weapons vehicles and other supplies that you will need to survive.Within minutes you will likely have to move across the map as you are shepherded into a shrinking play zone by an electromagnetic field that gets stronger and does more damage to you while in it towards the end.This is one of the more infuriating ways to die in Battlegrounds as you re usually running for your life towards the safe zone when it happens. I for one am quite prone to dying just a second before I would have made it to safety.Only one player/team can be left standing. Fight other players to the death in a variety of environments from forests and fields to towns and military outposts.In my personal experience the game is very tense especially in those final circles. I have made it into the top 10 on several occasions mostly by landing as far away from everyone else as I can and hiding from them as often as I can for the rest of the game or as some players call it playing a pacifist round and camping It is also not uncommon to make through almost an entire game without encountering a single other player.I m not the bravest player when it comes to engaging in combat against my enemy players. reaching 3rd place with zero kills in a duo round and twice solo. I do believe that duos are the more enjoyable way to play having a teammate to watch your back and help boost your confidence as a player.I ve played several rounds of duos most of which proved to be a struggle matching with random players from OC (And sometimes NA as its the default and its easy to forget to change your server before each round ) a lot of whom didn t have mics or just didn t say anything until it really suited them eg. when they needed reviving and not when I was whipping around trying to figure out where we were getting shot at from or trying to pick places to go. Interacting with your teammates is key for duo and squad game modes.That being said I have also had several very enjoyable rounds of duos game play matching with some awesome teammates who were more that keen to well be a teammate. We had some hilarious discussions and some great games.It is with those teammates and those teammates only that I have made it into the top 10 under the duos category.All up this is an excellent game for early access development receiving weekly patches and monthly updates based on community feedback and has a lot of promise for the future.I highly recommend Battlegrounds to players of all genres Lil Discoursehttp //alittlediscourse.wordpress.com,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

No radars no hit indicators nothing telling you which direction you were hit from it's all up to your eyes and ears.Luck plays a big part in determining how good the gear you end up with is but the majority of time skill plays the biggest part in determining if you're the winner or not toward the end of the game.The game was rough around the edges throughout early access but the past few updates leading up to release saw major improvements in both the UI and performance of the game which is now pretty consistent.In a year of online games going dead in a week $120 price tags for full games and pay to win crap PUBG came out on top as the best multiplayer shooter of the year.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Cosmetics do not count in my mind as content) which means you only have to pay one time 30 . after nearly 600 hours game still doesn't get old or repetitive the gunplay is still one of the best i have ever experienced in a shooter graphics are very nice. especially weapon models (unless you play with everything set to very low ofc) although i usually play with friends every now and then i play with randoms and the players are generally friendly and not toxic.if you enjoy tactical shooters with proper recoil and bullet physics and your pc is up to it i definetly recommend pubg.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-28,0,0,78,True,Not Recommended,Seriously don't purchase this ing game. For the 1st few hours this game is great then you ing realize that the whole game is literally based off of rng and luck. For someone who is competitive like I am it pisses you off when you get shot from the back without even giving you time to react and in order to win a ing game you literally have to get lucky drops and play likes a total ing . I feel like I press F on a 1000 different things for 20 30 minutes just to get killed out of no where. Just to add to the frustration I have a GTX 1060 and I struggle to even get over 60 fps on the lowest settings in some places. So getting into gun fights with terrible fps is great but it doesn't really matter because 90% of the time I have no ing idea where I am even getting shot from. So if you like a game that is totally based off of luck terrible optimization no skill required 3rd person and soon to come micro transactions in a early access game this game is for YOU!!!!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-28,1,1,261,True,Not Recommended,"Dont waist your money complete piece of br&gt EDIT I'll go into further detail here to let some of you know what you are in for. Pretty much the average game goes like this.Hit the ground Go through 15 20 buildings find your first rifle. Now go through 15 20 more buildings looking for a scope for said rifle. Dont bother you wont find one. Next you head on your merry way to the circle before the ""blue"" or ""gas"" or whatever that gay t is called catches you. Now be aware there are always atleast 5 10 people sitting in said gas with 15 First Aid Kits just picking people off as they come in. So say in theory you make it past those guys. You pick a spot to set up until you find out your next location to travel. Wait you hear something weird to your east its not a car there is no engine noise its not footsteps because its too fast... what is it then? OH ITS A BUGGY THAT MOVES ON PURE SORCERY AND MAKES NO NOISE AND THEN A CRAZY JUMPS OUT AND KILLS YOU FROM BEHIND.The next game. You will hit the ground like before and if you managed to land in a decent spot. Then you will find about 5 4x scopes with 0 guns anywhere. You've checked the entirety of the town but yet not one rifle. Now you will proceed to the next town over on foot with nothing but a shotgun and a useless pistol. BUT WAIT. WHATS THAT OVERHEAD! ITS A RED ZONE OH NO. You will make it through the Red Zone but wait a minute. That was far too easy. YOU ARE CORRECT THE RED ZONE COMES FOR YOU ONCE MORE and boom your ing dead. Pretty sick right?

2017-07-12,0,0,143,True,Not Recommended,"Updated So after much more playtime I can say with complete assurity that this game is a legitimate health risk. It's audio will override any safties placed on your system and attempt to deafen you. I would recommend playing the game with audio completely disabled but it is such an integeral part of game play you'd just be better off not playing the game at all.Furthermore the company still insists on using the antiquated marketing keylogger ""BattleEye"" to 'protect' against users implementing exploits in the game. You should expect to run into an abuser about 1 in every 3 games. They will range from Xray to Aimbot but there are also apparently unlimited ammo and teleportation exploits as well as others.Lazy anti cheat measures and a legitimate health hazard make this game incredibly hard to play and I couldn't recommend that anyone buy it.Old Post A lot of the gameplay is really solid but due to some exploits and bugs it really hampers down on the competetive play.

2017-12-27,0,0,360,False,Not Recommended,There's too many things that need fixing rn tbh. This game's literally still in alpha with the amount of problems it has such as some poor server performance which results in many problems really rubber bands bad hitreg damage not being properly calculated and im sure there's more problems but those are the ones I found most important and common. Another thing they need to fix is either the logic or the bugs because i've had times where i take damage from just parachuting in. The fact that you can't ram a car into another car to kill the people hiding behind it or the fact that hitting someone a teammate at literally 5 kmh kills/downs them while as hitting an enemy with that either does nothing. or does nowhere near the same amount of damage. Another thing i've found damage and whatnot needs to be reworked as some guns don't make sense in terms of how an SMG using either 9mm or .45 can still do the same damage as AR's with 5.56 and 7.62s. Plus the frag is really the only grenade used due to issues with the other grenades such as the stun grenades not properly stunning molotov just being a small AoE even if thrown on grass or at a person no DoT. The smoke grenades don't really cover an area well at all or properly. TLDR Game needs a lot of work still It should still be in alpha.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I've never had issues with anyone using aimbots or hacks to see through walls game was great. Now thats all there is I mean sure once in a while Ill get a game without that t and I love it. But in the last 20 or so matches an easy 12+ had some sort of wall hacker or aimbot user either killing me through enclosed windowless rooms or automatically detecting where I was when they enetered a room or hallway and arrived via vehicle. They say they've banned ""25000"" cheaters a day and a few week ago said ""150000"" players were banned. I've notice no change and I feel these numbers are t to sell their now failing product before its ""full release"".

Since its release there has been a multitude of hackers that are taking advantage of the crate system and mining them and also in game which is a real turn off for the game.I hope steam and blue hole alike start to crack down on these profiles! Apart from that I enjoy playing the game and seeing that they are constantly Introducing new patches to deal with the bugs and hackers with new cheat reporting systems.I am yet to experience since the upgrades of the blue zone and any further updates but will be good to see how it's been improved.All up a great game quite realistic and a good setting in which it's all about luck and skill.I hope there is but isn't a region lock as I have friends with whom I play with overseas from America and China for example and would still like the opportunity to be able to do so.Overall I give it a 8/10 minus 1 due to the hackers who make the game unenjoyable and minus 1 for the lack of bluehole listening to us early access players and all alike who request AS servers and ip addresses be region locked.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Unfortuantely PUBG Mobile seems to be doing better. MOBILE!?REVIEW 4 (Metal Rain Event) 10 out of 10 matches were plagued with hackers. Auto Firing SKS'ers all getting headshots. Single players wiping half the server. PUBG Corp needs to learn how to activily monitor suspicious behavior in game and ban in game. But hey at least they can ban streamers who play with hackers because the proof is so blatant its hard to miss.REVIEW 3 ( a few months later) At nearly 900 hours now. Sanhok battle pass is a total trash attempt. Fortnite make's the PUBG developers look they have no idea what they are doing. ""Trial Items"" are super lame and the value of the pass seems super low compared to Fortnite's battle pass. I hate fortnite but at least they aren't incompetent with their attempts. Nearly impossible to finish the Sanhok pass. Some of the items are out right painful to do and EXTREMELY time consuming. It feels like this was designed to get you to buy the battle pass and pressure you into buying leveling so they can maximize revenue. To top it off I got killed by flying cars. This isn't Harry Potter.REVIEW 2 I am in the top 0.20% (0.12% at best) for Squad TP with over 600 hours. 90% of games lately have had a chinese hacker/cheater in them. It is extremely irritating to have to change my play style to hide all the time to avoid cheaterswho auto aim shoot through terrain no recoil speed hack rez/heal hack and freaking teleport. I use to love this game but now its a totally crappy experience. China needs its own servers. Pre China release cheating was rare. Maybe 10% of games had a cheater. Region locking China would cut down on the cheating but it doesn't solve the problem. PUBG Corp needs to actively ban cheaters in game. If cheating wasn't a reason to region lock china the insane amount of ping/latency is a good enough reason. Positional updates can be extremly laggy for chinese plays so dead on shots are 2ft + behind them. Extremely irritating. REVIEW 1 (recommended from several months ago)Great Game. A bit Buggy.

Fortuantly i am confident the developers will eventually fix this as several issues have allready been fixed. It is also to be noted that the loot crate and keys system is quite greedy.

Everything has only gone downhill from there Bluehole claims to ""care about its player's experience in the game"" but nothing I've seen in the past month or two has shown any care towards the million or so of us that still put up with their lies only more paid crates and over hyped cosmetics.As someone with almost 400 hours in this game and who honestly enjoyed it before its a shame to see this game start to die like a bad MMO. People scream for bluehole to fix the ping problem or the constant disconnects or to region lock china because of the sheer amount of cheaters on servers for entirely different regions. So if you wanted to play a battle royale game anytime soon make sure you don't waste your hard earned money on this how of a money grab from bluehole.

Network lag makes hitting someone a flip of the coin and aiming is more a question of ""how will the network affect my shot?"" than anything else. You can aim right at someone and it will miss meanwhile on the replay they're almost never aiming at me when they kill me. Might be just the replay is done poorly but without any lag or other reason to be that way.Lots of other problems that other games solved years ago. No training area. A number of the keys aren't documented (guess what B does) but important shooting a nerf gun feels more substantive and I spend many minutes each match before I get to do anything (1 minute to queue lots of flying and parachuting and then constant running from the blue wall).

2018-05-22,0,0,214,False,Not Recommended,I've spent countless hours trying to convince myself that I enjoy this game but I don't. I really don't. Once the initial fun runs out once the thrill of having a good match runs out there's nothing left but frustration. You start every game praying that the RNG gods will smile upon you this match. Maybe you'll find a rifle quickly so you can fight all the other players that landed near you. Maybe the circle will end up on your side of the map. Maybe you'll get a vehicle spawn. 90% of the time it probably won't happen.I can't count the number of times I've died because the first 5 houses I looted had nothing but handguns in them while the first house the guy next to me looted had a DMR or assault rifle.I can't count the number of times I've landed somewhere only for the first circle to be as far away as possible from where I dropped.I can't count the number of times I've been stuck on the opposite side of the map from the circle and ran along the road for several minutes without a vehicle spawn as my health slowly ticks down and the circle grows ever farther away ensuring that I won't see another player before I die.I can't count the number of times I've gone an entire match without seeing a single person only to die in the last twenty to people fully decked out with high level weapons with all attachments and full level 3 gear because they happened to get into gunfights.The map massive size is directly to the detriment of the game almost every problem I have with this game stems from the fact that the map is so huge that seeing another living soul seems like a rarity at times. There's so much pointless open space that serves only to create a no man's land. Maybe the new map that's supposedly smaller will address some of these problems maybe it won't.

If you want action from the start you can easily get that by landing with other people anyway. Yes there are bugs and or glitches but they are always updating and fixing the game. The most recent update greatly improved the games fluidity mainly with vaulting. Many people are hating on this game because it should be flawless or triple A since it took the world by storm and sold so many copies and won an award in early access. In the end the triple A companies haven't made a game that compares to this so blame them. This is only $30 half the price of a regular game that won't provide the longevity most of the time. This game is about the experience. The experience of randomly running into a squard or another person randomly. The experience of moving into the last few circles where you are trying to find the remaining survivors whether it's in a field of tall grass and bushes a forested area with trees or a mountainous area with little to no cover aside from ridges and rocks. Your heart starts pounding because you want to win. You want that chicken dinner. Winning is always gratifying because it's not easy to do.

(e.g. i have a super strong PC i get 140 fps on max settings. when i look in the general direction of yasnaya my fps turns to 60) getting stuck in doors. new parachuting is utter . you try to land on a building it pushes you off the roof lets you fall and you lose about 50% of your HP GREAT STUFF! loot system is way too random. it appears you are never the one who finds the gun but your enemies do. ( but not as random as you think as it follows a specific pattern. you will tend to see specific loot like everyone has an AK with an 8x scope or everyone has a level 3 helmet etc ). that syndrome where your arms get heavy and your stupid character does not seem to be able to lift the gun over a little ledge to shoot over it instead he shoots the floor. (those happen alot in guardtowers wheere you can clearly see that your gun and is above the edge of the walls and you do not have the red indicator that something is in your way yet his arms get tired of holding the gun thus he shoots the floor. this happens alot in the guardtowers in giorgeo pool) the new nade trajectory is completly off the mark.there are probably even more ed up gameplay ""mechanics"" that i forgot to mention those where the ones that came to mind.now lets go over to the massive cheating issue.no matter which server you play there are so god damn many cheaters in this game.BattleEye is PUBG's anti cheat system and just read what they had tweeted a while ago.BattlEye TheBattlEye 28. Dec. 2017Update on the number of PUBG bans 1 500 000.followed byBattlEye TheBattlEye 4. Feb.We have banned over 1 044 000 PUBG cheaters in January alone unfortunately things continue to escalate.Now tell me that there is nothing wrong with cheating. ive seen alot of people say stuff like "" i dont see any cheater around ""well that may be because you got killed by someone who didnt cheat but there are probably still cheaters within that game which just didnt get to you. just look at the numbers they tell the whole story.thats why people cry out about REGION LOCK CHINA!But wait! it gets even worse.so... not only is the game brokennot only is it full of cheatersBUT!check out their insane development team!https //twitter.com/PUBG_helpon a daily basis these people post stuff like "" PC PLAYERS WE ARE AWARE OF "" *insert problem here*this actually happens on a daily basis... every day you log in there is a brand new problem which causes to break the game or break the servers so you can not do anything but wait for them to get their up and work on this.this usually takes about a couple of hours until you can finally play this broken game. just so that the next day they encounter another new problem and bring up their daily appology.So lets conclude.For all those that want to give this game a shot.just dont...Its not worth it right now. wait for them to fix these major issues it has.Once they resolve at least their server problems and the hacking issue it is actually a really great game to playit is tons of fun and super addicting as it gives you a super simple and fun experience.you get a gun you kill people until you win or die its that simple and it works but not under these conditions.edit it seems like they have done something about the chinese invasion and the massive amounts of cheaters its a better place now. still they didnt adress the rest of the cons ive put up.so............... still not worth it.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-02-13,1,1,44,False,Not Recommended,"Until load times are consistent region locking is implemented and hackers are actually banned this game will continue to wear out its hype until it dies to constant Chinese hacking and awful stability. Hit regenstration and ping rates will lead to constant infuriating deaths since NA players are constantly stuck playing on Non NA servers since there is an influx of Chinese players playing on NA slowing down load times and driving up ping rates. Play the game mid day on EST and watch as the majority of players in the match are Chinese screaming ""China Number ONE"" and one or two more phrases while tracking you with a non scoped kar98 killing you instantly a kilometer away with a headshot.Hacking needs to be tackled more seriously and region locking is not zenophobic and if not regionlocked then at least have ping limits in a game that tries to sell itself on realistic gunplay doesnt have huge spikes in netcode. This game can be really fun but when you don't load into 1/3 of the games despite having great internet connection (a 1070 and similar quality specs its not the pc that is struggling in this game either) die to hackers when you are in the top 10 and get random lag spikes when firefights break out with people with obviously Mandarin names the fun quickly ends.

2018-06-15,1,1,1428,False,Not Recommended,Honestly with the past few updates this game has become absolute ing trash. The cheat protection is absolutely garbage. On multiple occasions have i looked at the kill cam and saw that i was killed by a ing cheater. whether its walling aim bot whatever the case. STILL NO FIX????? Pathetic. Yall should have to pay every ing poor human being that bought this trash game their money back.. this is pathetic. I can't land on the ground without ing lagging and getting waxed by some from China that has a latency of 3300. Ridiculous. But hey you have weapon skins now...... ing awesome.... still cant figure out how to stop a hacker though. Congrats/...

2018-09-23,0,0,446,False,Not Recommended,I really love this game but it is so broken i dont know where to begin. To be honest it should still be i Beta. The most critical thing to me is the netcode/desync issues. I have countless of times encountered enemy's that i have been shooting fullauto with blood flying everywhere but still being the one ending up dead with the enemy just hitting me once or twice. I have encountered times where it felt like the enemy prefirered at me not knowing i was there. But when i watched deathcam he has been well passed the corner and probably saw me long before i saw him. To me it feels more or less like a lottery when in a gunfight who's going to walk out of it alive. And there's tiny things bugging the crap out of me. For an example trying to jump out of a window when being chased but all you do is end up standing by the edge of the window jumping like an idiot. My advice for people thinking about buying is to wait. This game is absolutely on of the most fun games i know but at the same time the worst because of all problems with it.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-12-06,1,1,69,False,Not Recommended,This game and company are quite atrocious they clearly do not care about their player base.When the game was still in its beta phase they permanently banned me for a reason I which was never told and then gave me the runaround when I tried to appeal the ban. The game said I was banned on Steam so I appealed to Steam who told me that it was Battleye who I should appeal to who then told me it was Bluehole I had to appeal to who then told me it was Steam I had to appeal to. I never even got unbanned in the end nor a refund or even an explanation as to why I was banned. I even opened a BBB complaint against Steam for refusing to refund me after they had failed to deliver what they promised to me and they simply never replied to the complaint and it was closed.This company clearly has no idea / does not care about what's going on with their own game and their regard for their players' experiences is very poor in my opinion. I can say that I definitely do not recommend this game to anybody and I will never purchase any product from this company again.Also for the record I was not hacking nor using any other form of cheats and I think that this being the only ban on my account shows that there is truth to that even if some people (companies) may not agree.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-06-25,0,0,185,True,Recommended,To get the important thing for readers out of the way Yes the game is fun and yes it's worth buying despite being in early access. While you shouldn't rush and get it as fast as possible you definetly won't regret it.For me the pros heavily outweigh the cons however this game is far from perfect.It's a hunger games style survival game pitting you against 100 other players by yourself or in a team.The objective is simple survive till the end. Pros Depth despite being in early access the game has a lot going for it from the weapons and weapon customisations to the freedom of being able to start off basically where ever you want to by jumping out of a plane (which is genius) Fun factor case in point the game's a blast. I highly recommend playing with friends as it amplifies the experience a ton. If you're looking for a game to play with a bud look no further Exiting the game does a great job of keeping games short enough by making camping one place prectically useless by forcing the players together over time. Also theres nothing more nerve racking than being in the top 10 in a gameBut now the cons the sound the sound is pretty bad. The music is okay but the effects are confusing. Inside the lobby the gunshots are a pain to listen to it's terrible plus the game does not do a good job of telling you where people are shooting you from hearing gunshots just alerts you that a player is near but its hard to make out a general direction optimisation performance aint perfect but its early access so it'll hopefully get better over timeVerdictGraphics 7/10Gameplay 8.5/10Sound. 5/10Performance 6 5/10Enjoyment overall 8.5/10Final score 7 ish/10 a lot of potential but a lot to improve,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-12-03,0,0,58,False,Not Recommended,I just wanna start how this game is pretty awesome in gameplay the concept and as a shooter game. However there is a huge technical flaws that is currently present in game. By technical I mean server lags performance issues bad optimization and awful synchronization. PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds suffers server lags that almost often lags you on some point due to I don't know? Bad servers I guess or congested servers. Next performance issues that even a high end PC is struggling to maintain stability on running the game (massive frame drops stutters noticeable system unit heating even running on Very Low Settings). Bad optimization is the same I think on performance issues. This game is like a Pizza rushed out of the oven too early without cheese just to sell it right away. It is optimized badly for Windows platform and I'm too skeptical on its performance for the PS4 system when it launches. Awful synchronization is a sub problem of server lags and performance issues. The synchronization between your client and other clients is noticeable to the extent that the server doesn't register your complete hits even if you shoot first. Some times the characters would just teleport a few centimeters away from your crosshair and teleports back due to bad synchronization. Overall this game is great if we are going to look at it as it is. But digging deeper to a technical level it needs a huge refinement.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-02-27,0,0,21,False,Recommended,Either you have to be a very patient player or you have to be very good at spotting other players and kill them. Getting those kills feel so satisfying and love the weapon varieties and customization/add on available for all the weapons. The different maps and weather conditions make the game more entertaining. The game is most fun when you can find one to three players to form the perfect squad and win those chicken dinners. Must have a very dependable squad to watch your back. If you have the squad done properly winning chicken dinner feels just too amazing. Especially the first one.That being said the vehicle physics is still clunky and servers are very laggy. The game optimization needs to be way better and better yet the cheaters just make the game feel . But don't let that ruin the game for you. I truly believe that everyone who loves Battle Royale style of games you will love the game. I highly recommend it.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-07-18,0,0,29,False,Not Recommended,Screw this game. It's a buggy unoptimised hacker infested mess. The developers have shown their true colours when they made the decision to add paid DLC to an early access game and yes although this is a 1.0 (or whatever version we're on now) release the game is still significantly less optimised than the average early access game.Plus their decision to sue EPIC for Fortnite (a game I don't personally care for) shows a level of arrogance and entitlement that is unfortunately commonplace in the industry. PUBG didn't invent the battle royale genre hell it didn't even innovate on it this is a by the numbers (or blunders) battle royale with absolutely nothing that sets it apart from the others aside from it's particularly buggy nature. And 20hz tickrate servers (at best!). It's laggy rubber bandy and is completely unnacceptable for a game such as this given it's competetive nature. Don't buy this don't support developers like this. They don't deserve your money.EDIT 10/01/19. More PAID DLC was released recently despite the game still being a buggy mess. I will never buy another PlayUnknown game again.

My experience has been very fun from solo games where you can manage to get to number 2 without killing a single person or taking shots at everyone and getting a lot of kills in squads or duo. It has a lot of issues like bugs crashing performance and lag but its in early access. If you have the money to spare and enjoy online fps do consider this a buy.''But as the game stands right now there is too many cheaters and people from CS GO are migrating to this game making it more toxic. In the beginning the game was fun even with the lag and all that was coming was exciting but it seems that the developer switched from making a game into making money. I've had my fair share of chicken dinners but when half of your losses are because of cheaters it demotyvates me from playing this game.Update 10/02/18 Developer has been banning cheaters but there is still too many of them every round has a cheater.Update 02/06/18 Cheating has become less of a common issue but there is some new issues developer has focused too much on making money by introducing skins and not making the game more stable have been experiencing crashes on a regular basis. The new map Miramar is probably the worst map they made the map is too open for a game like this. Apperantly the developer also supports people who cheat on their wives.Update 10/01/2019 Exciting stuff come out on PUBG since last time i played. Sanhok is fun as well as Vikendi but being a person who has played the game for a while im still dissapointed in the game. The new ranking system is as basic as it gets and matchmaking is at it's worst because one i cannot imagine anyone buying the game at this moment and learning how to play they would get destroyed (me getting matched with streamers is not normal as well after like two month absence) so for new players this is not a good purchase and second the performance is so wild i can go from having 120fps in a crowded town to 30fps in a middle of a field by myself makes no sense.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

So the only battle royal games i have played are PUBG Fortnite and some indie one with i own for like 3 or 4 years now and it is nothing more than a buggy mess. From these three i like PUBG the most BUT that does not mean that it is perfect.In fact this game is far from perfect gameplay wise and techical too.PUBG is out for over a year and still has issues that it had in the begining for example Server lag random deaths from falling very short distance seeing through stuff framerate drops etc... But when it works as it is intended to work its pretty fun. At the time of writing this review i have around 100hours And i have to say i have enjoyed them. For the 30 euros &lt 20 when it is on sale &gt it is good expirience when played with friends and for some when alone too. Would recomend when it goes on sale ),PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-11-20,1,1,35,True,Not Recommended,This piece of game is so unoptimized. You will be lucky to join a lobby on your 10th attempt and then u will have to stare at a loading screen while sound is aready being played. If u decide to tab out to close this buggy mess u will be amused to find that ur resolution has been fcked to the point u cant even see where ur mouse is anymore. Most of the times when this happens u will have 4/5 of ur screen still blocked by the loading screen so u are unable to close it with ur task manager. After having to hard reset my PC for like the 7th time playing this game i had to encounter several issues including my TeamSpeak Client not working anymore and Steam still displaying me as if i was playing PUBG unable to restart it nor uninstall. Fk this piece of game dont be naive like me and hope for optimization from this incompetent developer and refund it. Save urself the 20 bucks until its full release or dont ever buy it because u will have a bad time if u so happen to get into a situation like me. It doesnt matter how powerful ur PC is because this game will still manage to crash itself and ur entire system in the process. On a sidenote tho if u manage to get into a round where u can actually see something dont be surprised if after exiting the plane u encounter missing textures and a world that looks like goo making u an easy target and putting u through the hell i described before once again.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Microtransations were there but it wasnt needed by the player beause it was just cosmetics that looked horrible anyways. (2.50cents per key for a crate by the way!)They added weapon skins super late but it was okay because they gave you a few free weapon crates and it looks great.Till you have to buy boxes/crates to unlock em regularly....The dev promised no microtransactions until the game was fully completed yet flat out lied and did it anyways.The devs tried sueing other battle royales for ""copying"" their genre (Looking at you fortnite!) because they are money grubbing plebs.They ended up having to drop the case then about a month later added a ""Battle pass"" which gives you access to features for 10$! (Hmmmm thats what fortnite has...)The gameplay itself is fun with friends. But the devs are probably the worst i have ever seen with keeping their promises and the amount of greed they have is absurd. I will not be buying any other of their games ever.Remember the game IS fun But the direction its going it is dying slowly each day. Honestly i had my reviews positive since the VERY old days looking for hope for these guys and they continued to let me down. I have to give it a negative review. They are just too shady of a company to entrust my money with.If you want to play it go ahead you will probably have fun for awhile until you get bored.

They are abundant and make the game virtually unplayable. I have many recordings to prove my case. I understand there are people naturally good at the game. I watch them but when I watch some of the stuff I captured wow. Sad. All NA and EU servers are littered with Asian hackers. I'm not the only one who feels this way. Read up and you'll see. That is all.Edit (Developer's supreme logic) We've reduced hacking by 67.5 percent with these types of strategies ""Yes the majority of cheaters come out of China but that doesn't mean all Chinese players are cheaters. This idea that just because you've got a few bad eggs you've got to ban a whole country is a bit reactive ""Who said anything about banning a whole country? Region lock you tool. If that's too brash in your mind then fix the problem. You keep saying Calm the down Excuse my French. As I said we had a plan last year to get the game out in a year or get the game out by the end of the year and we did that. And we've planned for next year to continue to upgrade and improve the game so we're going to do that."" But this game is A. Nowhere near a completed game. B. Infested with cheaters/hackers in 9/10 games. There is a difference between salt for dying to a skilled player and salt for dying to hackers. I can definitely admit when I die to a good team/player.

2018-08-24,0,0,230,False,Not Recommended,Somehow this game got worse over time. It had less issues in early access.The OC servers haven't worked in months. When asked about it they blatantly removed the OC servers and now you don't get a choice for which region you want to connect to. So as someone in who lives in Australia I'm forced to play on servers in Asia or the USA with higher latency.Then there's the general gameplay bugs. You can easily clip on something while driving and then your vehicle is destroyed. This type of bug has never been fixed.Other random collision issues on objects when shooting sometimes you think your shot should clear an object but because a collision model wasn't done correctly the bullet will hit something else. Especially prevalent around window frames the top of fences and walls.The general player base is terrible. There is no region filter so a lot of people get stuck with players who don't speak the same language. I've been demanded by Chinese players to speak Chinese on an Australian server.These are some basic ideas that should have been implemented at the start back in early access.1. Have a language preference. You should be able to select your native language and get paired with other people on the same team who speak your language. This will solve the issue of having team mates you can't communicate with. 2. Default to the server with the lowest ping but also give the choice for server selection.3. The ability to report bugs through the player death cam. You can only report cheating in the current state of the game.Please don't guve this company your money. They don't deserve it.I do like the concept of a battle royale game but I'm sure another company will do a much better job. This is what happens when you only care about money instead of improving your product.

2017-10-15,0,0,194,True,Recommended,PLAYERUNKOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS is a 100 person battle royale game that you can play solo duo or with a squad of 3 4 people. As it is in Early Access the game has optimization problems which can be annoying at times but doesn't break the game. Overall the gameplay is easy to learn but difficult to master allowing for a frustrating but rewarding experience and when you finally get that sweet Chicken Dinner win all the 20 minute walking simulator games ending with a single shot will be worth it.With a price tag of 30 US dollars the game is a must pickup and if it ever goes on sale (Fingers crossed) don't wait to buy.Edit Vaulting adds a new aspect to the game and makes for a more fluid combat system be sure to map it to a distinct key or mouse button to avoid losing those window peeking fights.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-20,0,0,524,False,Recommended,Despite some server hosting and connectivity issues this game is pretty well polished for an early acess title and the team has already included alot of features i consider key to a good shooter/survival game. From Vaulting to Free Look to crisp unique weapon characteristics player unknown knew what had to go into a good game right away. Although there have been already countless controversies in the commuinty i only see that as a necessary effect of early access alpha game testing to help create a well rounded game that had community involvement especially for one that has preformed on the charts as well as this one has. Actually cant believe how bad the reviews are on here. This game offers some amazing experiences dont let salty reviews fool you also I see being able to play early acess as a privledge and will take it for what it is. Look foward to seeing the completed game all the variety it will have to offer through modding etc. Also worth noteing i've nominated this game for the CRY HAVOC AND LET SLIP THE DOGS OF WAR steam award of 2017TLDR This game will never be uninstalled from my drive.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-11-27,0,0,446,False,Recommended,PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds. This game has surely eaten up a lot of my time and for a good reason to. The fact that it has a brand new map at the time of this writing is just icing on the cake.To start this review I'm a long tome PUBG players. I've played since way back in the days of early access Erangel only. Watching the evolution of this game has been a treat. I've seen Miramar come out Sanhok come out game play changes nerfs buffs new guns new parachute system Vikindi new parkour and vaulting system and Fix PUBG's whole conquest to vanquish bugs and fix the game go through.Now did any of these updates make it better then what it was way back in the buggy Erangel days? Yes it has. However that doesn't mean it's completely fixed. What we have right now is a rather complete game with many new and exciting updates coming from the devlopers. They're feeding us players with more of what we want. More guns more maps more ways to play. Now and here's where the however part comes in this game still has many bugs. The first one you'll notice is in the middle of a fire fight you'll spray someone down and see the blood splatter effect for hitting them but in the death cam their health never goes down. I don't really understand that. Did I miss? Did the game glitch? High ping? Not hit registration?Another bug of sorts is that you can get stuck in certain places on certain maps. For example Sanhok has a little tiny crack that the player can walk into while crouching but can't get out of because you can't jump/vault out while crouching. Thus trapping the player to die to a sad death from the border.Dispite these bugs and a few more the game is still extremely enjoyable. In fact with friends this game has the most potential to be an enjoyable and never ending game fully of laughs and tryhard moments. In the end it all boils down to what the players make of it. The expirance you get from this game comes from what you want to do. You can learn every weapon and dominate in twenty kill games or try to get a zero kill win. It all boils down to what the players want. And that's why I recommend PlayerUnknow's Battlegrounds to anyone who hasn't already bought it. Pick it up play with friends enjoy a laugh. Hours of fun await.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-12-21,0,0,217,False,Recommended,I got PUBG as a birthday present back in August and I loved it then and the months following but nothing compares to what it has become now. With patch 1.0 the game runs smoother the graphics are improved it loads faster the servers are more reliable the UI is much better AND THERE'S A CHICKEN DINNER SHIRT. I'm not saying that PUBG was bad before it was still in early development (and still is) but what we have shows that the developers listened to feedback and released a polished incredibly fun game. This is how you do early access when the game is in a near complete state to get feedback and interest and then release the full game and meet everyones expectations (Take note DayZ). I can't wait to see what this game brings in the future because I know that i'm not stopping playing it anytime soon.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-04-19,0,0,950,True,Recommended,Great game with loads of potential. Still some bugs of course but nothing you can't expect from an Early Access game.It seems there is finally a developer out there that knows what he is doing the improvements per patch in this game and the frequence they get pushed with is many many time better the H1Z1 or DayZ for example.Finally I love the gameplay in the current patch (19 04 2017 when writing) it is still a bit clunky at times when interacting with things in the world (loot buildings etc.) and the preformance is a little instable yet it is very enjoyable to play. Can't wait to see what tomorrow's updates will bringEdit (30 07 2017) Regarding all the hassle I personally feel it is blown way out of proportion tho I do find their communication around this a bit cluckyGameplay 180+ hours later it is amazing how much work the dev's have done compared to other EA games. The game runs much smoother and stable eg looting has improved a lot.

2018-10-23,0,0,38,False,Not Recommended,"Product received for free. I'm not sure about this game. Sometimes it's fun sometimes it isn't. BUT. This game has some serious problems that NEED fixing. Firstly the gameplay is INCREDIBLY slow if you don't want to die immediately. I drop at a secluded part of the map where I'm confident nobody is going to and get equipment from whatever is at the few houses or buildings. I then have to spend most of the game constantly paranoid that someone is gonna shoot me from behind and sitting in buildings or under somewhere. Even on Sanhok Mini Royale I'll drop near a group of 4 houses and a shed I'll get very basic equipment then spend most of the game just running around praying I don't get sniped by some rando with an assault rifle. When this does happen I don't even have time to react because there is next to no indication as to where you were shot from you just hear your character in pain and before you can turn around to shoot back or get to cover you're already dead. There wasn't anything you could have done to fight back much less prevent that. That just isn't fun. I feel like I wasted my time looting just to die to someone I couldn't even see. The balancing is also VERY off. Say for example you are in a CQC situation. You have a shotgun and the other person has an SMG. Who wins? Most who are thinking logically would say you would win because shotguns are MADE for close quarters combat. SMGs are too however they are not usually capable of dispatching a hostile with one shot unlike a shotgun. HOWEVER this is PUBG where you won't win that gunfight your shotgun will fire slightly to the left or right you'll do very minimal damage and you'll be dead before you can even fire a second shot. Yes even with the S12K even if you do get a second shot off it more than likely will not save you. SMGs are way too powerful. They beat shotguns in close range assault rifles at mid range and I have even managed to kill someone who had an AWM with a UMP 9 and they were on a mountain across a field from where I was and they had a much better angle and shot on me. Some assault rifles also need some tuning. I don't feel that ANY assault rifle in a game like PUBG should be able to one shot headshot someone from a distance beyond 25m. While in reality this would be possible this is PUBG where apparently the devs don't give a damn about balance in a game supposed to be ""realistic."" This issue is most apparent with the M416 especially when equipped with a suppressor. If someone is fortunate enough to get an assault rifle suppressor an M416 and pretty much any optic they are capable of killing anyone at nearly any range. This gun needs a nerf. Now. I'm going to be completely honest with this. PUBG Corporation and everyone affiliated. LISTEN TO YOUR COMMUNITY. STOP TRYING TO MAKE THIS GAME AN ESPORT. THIS GAME IS NOT FIT TO BE AN ESPORT. It is too RNG dependent to be an eSport. You trying to make this game more catering to an eSport is ruining the integrity of what PUBG once was. This isn't the balanced fun experience the community wants and you really need to make some changes. I would bring up the CS GO esc case system but I'm not going to. It's been done to death and the fact that you guys have not listened and have continued to push this loot box system in your already thirty dollar game is insulting to consumers and is not okay. I DID recieve this game as a gift and I enjoyed it to begin with. Though once the normal BP earned crates started requiring keys and like 70% of the kills were gotten by the UMP 9 and M416 I simply can no longer recommend this game. PUBG you were fun but the money hungry developers have RUINED this game. Fix your PUBG. Fix it.Edit ALSO THE SERVERS ARE AWFUL I HAVE BEEN KICKED OUT OF ALMOST EVERY OTHER MATCH DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Not at all and at the current rate they are working on the game to solve the hacking issues i don't know if i could ever recommend the game. It is not subtle hacking it is not questionable hacking it is simply blatent and obvious. And while they are banning an ungodly amount of players per day they are selling just as many games per day. They also refuse to region lock the game and as an NA player that infuriates me. The head of their studio and designer of the game flat out said that 99% of the hacking in this game is coming from China but would somehow not be fair to the players to region lock the game. This smells of corporate t to me and most of the NA players out there. The China market is bigger and buying more copies so they do not care if the NA players can't even resonably play on their own servers due to the hacking.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

But there are no advantages without shortcomings the lack of this game is the number of bugs and it is very difficult to hone the ability to shoot because the opportunity to meet the enemy is very rare and even though we are not familiar.

2017-11-04,0,0,432,False,Not Recommended,First of all I want to point out that what I am criticizing today is entirely subjective and based upon my personal experience with the game. I am open to criticism if you wish upon ranting. Let's begin.It's a great concept executed decently at the beginning. It's a game where you can expect hundreds upon hundreds of well deserved hours both alone or with friends. I have had endless amounts of funny moments playing with myself (not in that way) and friends. Yes When I play there have been some frustrating moments experiencing lag related/hacking issues. But it has never been as horrible as it's now. That's what this review will focus on today. Positive aspects have been named countless times. There is no need for me mentioning them in that case. Hackers. I have no words for this. It's pathetic ruining the experience for the obeying players. If Bluehole made an effort to damp their numbers it wouldn't be as excessive as it is now. I m not going to drop accusations of being greedy on their team but implementing protocols and not lying for the players about banning hackers would make quite some progress. Optimization. Since launch it has not been improved. If you are thinking about buying this game please consider waiting. You need quite a beefy desktop to reach at least 40 50 fps at all times. The reason I need to include this aspect is because it has gone such a long time since launch. Still not fixed a single bit. Client/server side. Let's set up a scenario. Top 20. You're being shot at so you throw yourself in cover. You die. You scratch your head thinking about ending it all. It was crystal clear you got to cover in time yet somehow you managed to die. Because the servers are laggy the server side would have shown you getting stomped on out in the open. What I am describing here is a new problem. It wasn't there to begin with. It has most likely developed with time. It's quite frustrating playing well then dying to something you have no control over what so ever.Something else I need to issue is the rubberbanding. Basically you move forward then lag a couple of metres back. I have noticed it's way worse in Duos compared to Solo or Squads. This sole dysfunctionality has driven me insane a couple of times often resulting in me smashing my table in a blind fury seeking to eliminate every last piece of evidence about Bluehole .I think it's time to get into the conclusions. Please excuse my rants they were probably not meant for you. Around launch which is the time I bought the game these issues were not present. Okay the optimizing part was but not the client/server perspective issues and the hackers. I would say give the developers some time to fix these issues. Right now I would actually deem this game unplayable and I do absolutely not recommend this game in it's current state.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

On the other just had 3 games in a row with a cheater getting chicken dinner they don't even hide anymore because noone will ever ban them. Obvious hackers ruin the whole experience seeing a killfeed with 3 squads killed one by one by a cheater and knowing already that you stand no chance against them feels bad. Reports are left unanswered I even provided a video proof of a hacker to the support team and all I got was ""hey thanks for your report"" and yet their op.gg stats show that they keep cheating without a ban. God damn I have really good time with this game if it's a fair fight sometimes it's even ""inspiring"" if you get outplayed and rekt but the experience is ruined by wallhacks and aimbots. I cannot recommend this game until this issue is reduced to a minimum. If it's fixed you will earn my (and lots of people's) positive review. And hey Bluehole! Remember if you ban them they will have to pay you again. )edit Just got a message that one of those hackers got banned so there is definitely work in progress I really hope it gets better over time!

These names should be instantly banned as soon as they enter the game with it as it is obviosuly a vantiy thing.

So maybe take my words with a grain of salt. I'm not as up to speed as most of these people. But with that said...Should you buy this game? No. Not until it's fixed. I want to like PubG more I want it to succeed but it won't at this rate. It's a mess between Chinese hackers/cheaters players abusing desync bugs sloppy gameplay it's just too much for me to overlook. The only reason I have the 20 hours I have in this game is because I really enjoy playing with some of my buddies. And don't get me wrong when you can make it 30 minutes without a player decked out in level 3 gear (with a blantanly Chinese name) crawling through a wall to shoot me in the back of the head or if you can drive more than a km without hitting an invisible wall or clipping through something and exploding this game is fun. It has so much potential. Some players have been putting up with this for what 9 months or more? Based on that devs either cannot or will not get this pile together. I cannot recommend it until they do. For the developers Yo devs you need to fix this game before a AAA corp does. Anyone who plays this game knows this isn't racist it's the truth region lock china. UI problems defaulting to Asian servers when I'm in North America or showing that I am in one region when in actuality I'm not. Desync is frustrating to deal with when I have like &lt 30ms of latency. Vehicles hit invisible obstacles. Give some sort of feedback to players who are reporting cheaters. Optimize things. There's no reason to need a $1000 PC to run this. I don't remember the last time I had such an adrenaline rush playing a video game. It's truly a shame this game cannot deliver like that regularly.

Once the lobby is full everyone gets in the C 130 Cargo plane and swallows their mic letting out their warcry. After skydiving to the ground everyone is pitted against eachother in a race for gear and vehicles. As time passes the battlegrounds are slimmed down forcing combat between players.

2018-11-02,0,0,989,False,Not Recommended,So I roughly have about 1000 hours on this game and I was hesitating to give this game a bad review. After all for the price of the game and some in.game cosmetics I got entertained for a long time even though it was mostly frustration after 10 min of looting.It can be fun it can be exhilarating it can be freaking awesome. It's hard to match the feeling of hitting that sniper shot from 500 meters away. Especially after the Sanhook patch the game seemed to really be going where it needs to be. But lately the past 2 weeks to be exact it has been as bad as it can get. The animations the missing footstep sounds the desync the cheaters. It got unbearable. In 90% of my games I get frustrated due to preventable deaths caused by these reasons rather than being outplayed whereas in the past I experienced death as a lesson on how to improve my play.Anyway.

2017-11-23,0,0,213,True,Recommended,Product received for free. Hard to say whether its worth 30 pounds at the moment however you will see why this game became a phenomenon as other battle royale games such as H1Z1 and Fortnite don't come close in terms of gunplay and excitement. Its negatives are its lack of other maps although they say PUBGs full release next month will supply us with another map and an addition of one more during early next year should fix this considering the amount of people developing the game and its huge sales I feel like this should have been fixed already. Another negative is its dodgy netcode shots that you know hit don't register which can get frustrating. Another frustration are the cheaters.Although there aren't as many as people say there are or as many as in other games such as Counterstrike you only need 1 out of the other 90 odd people in your game to cheat in order to have a bad experience Despite these issues the game is highly addictive and destroying entire squads is very satisfying and leads me to recommend PUBG.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-06-16,0,0,933,False,Not Recommended,I have 757 hours in this game and have stopped playing it and probably won t go back to it either why?1. Weapon change update completely destroyed the game what s the point of ARs? A UMP will destroy you at range with its non existent recoil even with no attachments. 2. Buggy lobby for some reason my friends couldn t see me online for months and I couldn t invite them to the group. This happened to a few us once again for months.3. The servers are laggy some games felt like you were 2 seconds behind everyone.4. Constant FPS drops and performance issues especially during event modes.Sadly I can see PUBG coming to an end even the more popular streamers are slowly moving onto other games.

Servers have some of the worst latency drops I have ever seen in an online multiplayer game with missed bullets. Kill Cam confirms this. Hell sometimes they are not even looking at me. Google PUBG and Server Tick Rate.This game is quite literally the most successfull failure in its' genre. Why people continue to support this game and think its fun is mind numbing.Sure I enjoy firing a 9mm glock full auto into an opponent at close range with little to no effect because only half the bullets register.If you enjoy hackers loot simulations bad tick rates framerate drops and the fact the game company cares little in the way of improving the game but making money off of its ports then by all means purchase this game.

2017-12-19,0,0,85,True,Not Recommended,This game is absolutely not ready to leave early access. The devs need to do a TON of optimizing and need to fix the crazy amount of glitches still present in this title. With that said this review is being written before the official 1.0 release but in its current state I don't have confidence in this title. It pains me to give it a negative review because conceptually and on a gameplay level it IS a good game. But I personally thing the devs are jumping the gun on leaving early access and especially since they've just announced a second game I don't think the devs are going to pay enough attention to this game to fix it's current issues and keep a steady stream of content coming. And this is stacked on top of the fact that the devs have been clear that they intend to start with microtransactions after the full release. TL DR Decent even good game but still really glitchy and not ready to leave early access may get abandonded by the devs.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-10-05,0,0,506,True,Recommended,Absolutely recommended. Perfect.Before you read this if you don't know what this game is it is a Battle Royale game (pretty much Hunger Games which means that the last man/team standing wins). It is relatively a game for seasoned veterans since there are extreme bullet drop physics the ammo is characterized by the name and color and the weapons all use distinct kinds of ammo depending on the type too. Sounds are one of the most important parts in this game and skills will help you be the last man standing.This game was not very well optimized at first and was still pretty successful. But now that it is out of Early Access this game has received some good love and work from the developers. It has been amazingly optimized by the development team vaulting has been implemented the main menu has been upgraded and overall it has become an extremely successful game and one of my favorites. At first it wasn't popular and was full of bugs but now it is one of the games that might even mark videogame history for the Battle Royale genre. But remember you may want to play shooter games or similar before playing this one as this is not easy on new players.I strongly recommend this to you if you love Battle Royale games but I recommend you also have a good PC with a GTX 770/AMD R7 370 or higher to play this at a good framerate and an i5 processor. 10/10.

I was pleasently surprised to see my frame rate consistently above 80. Shortly after my first 10 or so games PUBG started crashing and I couldn't play this game without the game crashing due to memory issues. I'm writing this review on 1 25 18. I still experience the same performance issues that I did back when this game was still in early access. This is a full developed game and I am still experiencing the same issues from early access. These developers only want your money and are scum. DO NOT BUY!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-03-19,0,0,108,False,Not Recommended,To put it short if you're not buying it for the sake of playing with friends then don't buy it.There are simply too many glitches that have ruineds its basic playability yet Bluehole's been showing much less interest in fixing bugs than putting some more skins on sale. It's as if people play this game to change clothes and the shooting part becomes irrelevant.And the most interesting part of PUBG is Bluehole's immense patience for hackers. You'd probably expect bluehole to have enough experience on this matter after two goddamn years of dealing with hackers. But guess what they never improved a bit compared to Day 1. It's become a question of whether Bluehole simply lacks the ability to detect hacks or they treat it as a minor issue both are as horrifying as they can sound.The decline of PUBG over the past year isn't for no reason. The more battle royales in the market the more choices players will have. Bluehole continiuing its current attitude stands zero chance against the rising titles in this inevitable battle to come.Bluehold never seems to comprehend what players want and enjoy. Or perphas they do but just takes it less seriously compared to selling fancier skins at higher price.There had been moments for PUBG. It had the potential to become the next League of Legends or at least the next CSGO. Yet it has wasted 9 in 10 of its potential only to become what is it today.I call it a shame.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Although there are a lot of good times spent on this game catching yourself spending hours upon hours of valuable time playing PUBG then after pondering how bad your life is stuck in this hole of misery and despair and feeling pity for yourself a sad human who spends their life on this horribly optimized game with so many glitches and bugs you could say it is a game only a mother could love.

2018-07-26,0,0,6,False,Not Recommended,I can not recommened this game for a lot of reasons the fact the game is poorly optimize and hasn't been fixed in months and it still is a issue with us the community who play this game. I know i am not the only person who has pointed it out. I've heard so many youtubers i watch same the same thing about the poot optimization with this game. The fact people from other countries can play on north american server and when it comes to playing with them in squads to hard to communicate with them and figure out how to use team work in order to win the game and the fact that communication is a major part to surviving and winning the game. There should be an option in the game that use to use at the main menu where you can choose what type of team mates you want to play with like an english option or another language option. I have only spent about six hours of playing this game due to the fact every time i die and i view the death cam and see the people who killed me using aimbots or some form of hacks. In a couple of games when I died again view the death cam and saw a person being miles away and seeing that the person didn't have to aim at me to down then kill me because that person was already automatically locked on to me even tho i was miles away from that person. The anti cheat system in place aka battle eye is not doing enough when it comes to the problem of hacks people paid real world money for to use to get an easy kill and an easy win. The developers seem to have the mindset of making more money off of loot boxes and selling steam keys and event passes instead of listening to use about glitches and bugs that have plagued the game even when it was in early access and they role out updates almost every day but yet the problems that plague the game still are there and not fixed. At one time this game had 3 million or more players playing this game but a lot of those people l eft due to all the problems i pointed out in this review. People still play this game it isn't a ghost town but I don't play it cause I am sick of giving the developers creative feedback and they not listening to me nor anyone else The bottom line is this i can't honestly say this game is worth the 30 dollar price tag if anything it should be free to play cause not only are you paying 30 dollars for unfinished product but you also have to play over 2 extra dollars to open a loot box with access to steam keys. I no longer play this game due to all the issues that are plaguing this game it has become borderline unplayable. The state this game is in has become laughable to the point it's not longer funny to me atleast anymore it's more anger that i feel being ripped out of 30 dollars i paid for this game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Early mid and endgame are all fun You can choose your playstyle yolo ambush camp but it's survival so dying to a more patient player is easy Still haven't gotten a solo win yet!Now I'm pretty casual and I'm used to the 100+ ping on OCE servers as a Sydney player. However I'm going to have to draw the line here. PUBG tells us there are 3 servers that satisfy a &lt 200ms ping which is perfectly playable once you are used to it those being Australia tokyo and singapore for me however none of these work anymore. I'm being forced onto 250ms ping servers and if I'm lucky I can get one that's actually in asia still that is only 220ms. So I'm being forced onto servers on the other side of the world ... just so that this game can satisfy the 90+ players per game requirement. This makes the game hard for me and hard for others when I kill them around corners. Hence I cannot recommend a game like this that just to satisfy it's arrogance at getting 90+ players a game it will only allow players to play in the region that can actually do that.It's a great game it's just too ambitious for what it actually is. The devs need to face reality at some point and allow games with low numbers of players. To reitterate I am fine with less than 200ms ping which means I am fine connecting just about anywhere in asia but I don't want to and I don't think anyone in NA wants to play games with me either when I lag super hard.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-07-16,0,0,262,False,Not Recommended,"So I don't write reviews until I can say I've invested a good amount of time (and perhaps money) into a game. This helps me understand the mechanics the community the good and the bad. I've been gaming since 1993 gaming on the PC since 2002 and I competed in tournaments sponsored by EA in 2008 and 2009.I was relcutant to buy PUBG when it first came out and it took a lot of friends to force my arm into getting it. When I got it PUBG was one of the most popular mainstream games. I didn't want to get it because I heard horror stories about people getting banned because they killed a ""popular streamer"" and that said ""popular streamer"" accused them of stream sniping or hacking. When developers put so much capital into particular players of the game the outcome isn't usually positive.Initially I was pleasantly surprised to see that the hackers weren't so bad and I didn't get banned for killing a baby streamer. I was impressed at the graphics and feel of the game although the hit registration seemed to lack. (I have over 120/120 internet so my internet was not the issue)Back in 2017 I quit PUBG when a massive wave of asian hackers swept over the game. At least 7/10 of our games ended with someone aimbotting with a bunch of random letters and numbers in their name.I returned in early July 2017 and although I remembered some of the reasons why I liked this game originally I also remember some of the reasons why I left. The problem with hackers still exists although it is noticably less (so is the active population of the game though).At this time I cannot recommend this game. Perhaps it is fun and playable in a LAN or Tournament environment but for the common gamer with the hit registration problems and the remaining hackers who go unchecked the game has not reached it's potential. If they can clean up the registration possibly by restricting NA players to NA servers AS players to AS servers unless they are grouped together the game will be much more enjoyable.If the game improves and I am still playing I'll revise my review. At this point the game is more frustrating than enjoyable.07/18/18 Update After the latest patch I spent over 15 minutes refreshing the game. I could not even access the lobby all I received was ""Servers are too busy please try again later.""My wallet is too busy next time you have an event please try again later.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-08-04,0,0,965,False,Not Recommended,"One of the worst games you can play right now. (If you can even play it because it takes about 10 minutes to get into the menu after constant ""Servers are too busy"" errors). But that's fine let's begin with the actual problems. Net code hit registration and hitboxes are one of the best parts of this game you can hit an enemy up close with S868 in the torso and arms and the enemy will only be hit for half of the damage an enemy can hit you with fists while you are 3 meters away from him a car can run you over when you're standing behind a tree or was a few meters away from you.Loot doesn't load when you land it takes about 5 or 10 seconds for it to randomly appear on the ground making hot drops nearly impossible to survive. Loot RNG is also great you can run through 2 houses in Po i and only find backpacks boots shirts pants machetes and scopes no weapons but attachments for them while your enemy gets awarded with lvl 2 armor and helmet set an m416 with nice attachments and a couple of grenades. Delays desync and lags after a year and a half they still can't fix server issues you still get hit after reaching cover your enemy still doesn't receive damage sometimes or the damage is delayed you can also just freeze for a second or teleport backwards at random times.Microtransactions I know this isn't a big issue for most of the people but for me it's really annoying that devs promote their and streamer skins everywhere you go in the lobby in the store (well kind of obvious) and these skins cost too much for what they look like. Opening crates with keys is one of the worst investments you can currently make you get nothing of value you will keep getting the same 3 cent items over and over don't bother. The halloween event they had was just a money grab event nothing special. I will not even talk about the Sanhok battle pass.The game is slowly dying nothing gets fixed more streamer (and regular) cosmetics being added since streamers are the only people who keep this trash game alive. And even the streamers who streamed pubg on regular moved to better games than this. I will probably continue playing this game once in a while to see how it has become over the time.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2018-11-07,0,0,476,False,Not Recommended,"One Line Review Once I loved this game. Now it's trash. Cannot recommend it even with the ""Fix PUBG"" campaign.Longer Review I really enjoyed PUBG.As you can see I have close to 500 hours logged with those hours pretty evenly spread over all gametypes (solo duo squad) with a group of about 8 10 people from all over the US.I loved adreneline pumping gameplay calling out locations in a panic with your squad and just trying to keep up with the damn circle with or without friends.While i've looked a bit there hasnt been another game thats provided me with the same feeling of desperate survival in a deathmatch which is what has and still does make PUBG so unique.However I can not overlook the fact that the game is riddled with band aid patches hackers questionable physics among other issues.I really began seeing these issues late 2017 and they've continued since then with no indication it will end Every patch i have to download seems to be a gig or more and seems to do nothing but add to the micro transactions. This wouldnt be a cause for complaint if the base game was more functional which leads me to my next bullet... ""We've fixed ____"". I'm calling Bull**** if that was the case then after at least a year of band aids the game should be better or at the very least playable. It feels like hardly any actual issues have been addressed. Hackers. I would like to point out that I understand that games have cheaters. I get it. I'm not the person to ask how to fix this but its literally killing PUBG. I recall the immense amount of ""Region Lock China"" stuff that happened and I have no idea how that was resolved nor do I care. The problem persists and its driving people away. Normally I wouldn't put physics on the same level as hackers but it feels like every time I come back to PUBG they've altered vehicle physics so now I bounce off a hill into the sky and come crashing down in a firey explosion. Hackers not needed physics got to me first. Player physics are on the same level as i've gotten stuck in place more times that I can count. Usually while being shot at. Again Hackers not needed I'll just bleed out now.I've recently played a bit of solo and some duo/squads with friends (in First Person Perspective since Third Person Perspective always had at least double the amount of Hackers) and I would like to also address this ""Fix PUBG"" thing. Specifically how the game feels now in comparision to the last time I played around July 2017 ish. It feels... smoother? But still chunky like a low quality blender. Sure at least half of the ice chunks are gone but its still not a good smoothie. Maybe it's time to consider a new blender (maybe rebuild PUBG from the ground up or revisit the fundamentals?) Hackers are still an issue. Each game i've played in the recent 20 hours has had a hacker. It blows me away that its been over a year since hackers were ""addressed"" and yet in every game I get my head blown off by someone who obviously didnt see me but they were able to flick to me shoot and continue onwards while i've died. Watching my deathcams is basically me watching the enemy mouse lock onto my face fire a couple times and boom i'm dead. Since coming back the main menu UI has drastically changed and while there is still BP and the available crates you can get with it PUBG has obviously fallen hard into the micro tranaction scene. I don't care if people want to spend money on cosmetics thats fine I do plenty of it myself. HOWEVER PUBG is fundamentally broken and to me it looks as though Bluehole would rather cash in while the going is ""good"" rather than actually fix the basics to any shooter and make the game something amazing.Some of my friends still play so I'll likely keep it installed for the time being. But i doubt I will actually play much of it if any.I would love to say I believe Bluehole will fix PUBG but obviously it's been a year and really... nothings changed.I would love to say I believe Bluehole will actually stop Hackers... but they haven't and likely won't.I would love to say I believe Bluehole will do anything other than placate it's playerbase... they haven't yet.I'm not intersted in playing PUBG anymore. You've had your chances. You've had your shot. I'm done.I'm more than happy to be outplayed by others thats how shooters work but hackers... hackers just make everything I've done up to that point worthless.

2017-04-24,0,0,119,True,Not Recommended,"Product received for free. DO NOT BUY THE GAME!!!!!! Update This game has only gotten worse cheats have taken over this game more than they did H1Z1. Bluehole is another failed company using early access to line their pockets and putting out that should get them jailed.It's time this early access stopped it does nothing but produse bad games and give hackers and other cheats nothign but time to ruin things for others.There is no point in this game anymore so save your money and buy something else does not matter when the game is finished it wont be much different it will just lose the ""early access"" bull and roll over players taking their money and giving us nothing it's a trap like WoW H1Z1 Dayz and many more games.Reason 1) Cheats. Lots of them nothing being done. Yes yes I get it early access but no. Cheats run wild and BlueHole doesn't do anything.Yes you say Blue Hole asks you to report cheaters on forums and twitter... GREAT IDEA. We did this me and my friends two of them streamers on twitch. All four of us nice posted the way they asked streamers gave screen shots and their e mails to let the staff know they had VoD's of all this.less than an hour later all 4 of us banned from forums the streamers banned for life from the forums and from blue hole twitter. Talk about great support.There is other cheating going on. Lots people teaming up with friends in solo que. It is at the point where so many people team they don't even hide it cause Bluehole does nothing. We are talking about people riding in the same car or boat. Camping the same room in the same house or on the same hill fighting and looting together not hard to spot.This is so easy to spot but then again if you report you will more than likely be banned.Reason 2) As stated above BlueHole are Awholes.Reason 3) This one is not a big problem yet but will be down the line it will be a big problem for sure cause the hackers will take hold of this scam and make it a problem.The problem is currency farmers and does not harm much now but soon will be a problem like H1Z1 and CS GO.These are the people that join and then afk let the game start and just let their player get ejected from the plane when it's done flying over. They land and are either killed by other players camping their bodies or till the circle gets them and they get what ever currency they got.Or you have some one with multiple accts joins a game ( I usually see this in squads) They move all their players to a house or some hiding spot and wait till the games ends for them some how. I usually find them in out of the way places and are easy to pick off nice score booster. But the problem is many of these people do this for the game currency to buy crates or items and them put them up for sale on the steam auctions. Now you'll say this is harmless but when people can make real money from fake currency it's going to turn into a problem when they add more vanity items to the game and when they can make real money and turn to cheats to help them stay alive longer or what ever. In the end it's going to be a problem and it's not going to end well.Anyway those are the problems with the game. Sure all games have cheats but when the makers of the game blow it off and don't do anything about it you know it's just going to get worse and Bluehole and steam will cover it up and spit out t to scam cash off as many ppl as they can.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-09-04,0,0,384,False,Not Recommended,If you had bought PUBG in the early days and played it you would have said this game had great potential. For a short time it seemed like it was going well top game on steam regular updates new guns. Exactly what you need in a pre 1.0 game. I accepted that the maps would take a while it was a detailed first map (considering the dev team at the start) and the extra modes like fog and rain added quite a lot to the game even though it was a small change. However they messed up on the marketing and media of the game. Of course Fortnite would jump in on the money that's business and fair does to them they made a valid rival to compare to PUBG that focused on the younger market. Nothing wrong with that. But PUBG were promising things like new maps and guns that were taking too long to be released essentially driving people to leave their game to play another. Plus too much focus was put on more platforms instead of the current users they had. The waiting I could deal with and I wasn't the biggest fan of Fortnite regardless of it being a good game (I preferred the more realistic guns and maps of PUBG that's it and being bad at Fortnite) but the thing that slowly stopped me from enjoying the game was the constant updates for the aiming and recoils of the guns. For some this isn't a big deal but for myself needing to figure out the new recoils after every update turned the game from being a quick game that I could jump into whenever to being a chore before being able to enjoy the game again. This game had its time in the sun and I had a lot of fun playing it but the hype has now died. The updates are poor. The new map (4x4) is trying too hard to compete with Fortnite. The community has little to no faith in the devs any more. I doubt there will be any new features that will recover the game (I hope that I'm wrong) and there doesn't seem to be any clear path for the game to get back to what it once was. Removing the fog and rain modes were a poor move which added to the downfall. Why remove a feature that you ve already spent time developing?In all buy this game last year when it was good.

2018-10-29,0,0,359,False,Not Recommended,"So I'm gonna tell you the pros and cons (IMO ofc)of this game but overall the score would be a 6/10.This is a slow paced ""realistic"" nerve racking game that you might find addictive oryou will hate. Mainly if you want to be good you have to learn how to hear people around youand how to shoot. And both require a lot of practice.The problem is even the players that love it(like me) tend to not wantto play it anymore because of the incompetent developers and the LACK OF QUALITY NEW CONTENT.Pros A very realistic battle royale that has unique weapon mechanics Runs very smooth (most of the time) Has both 3rd person and FPS perspectives Great weapon attachment system and great weapon mechanicsCons Constant desync will make you die behind cover and it can bevery frustrating.Also sometimes you will not hit people althoughyour red dot/holographic is pointing at them. Frame drops (I dont know exactly what triggers this) Loot not spawned when landing in a crowded area (appears after about 3 5 seconds) War Mode is not working properly and you can't join while playing with friends(you can only join solo and switch teams in the lobby). War Mode is a joke anywayit isn't even worth mentioning. It's like when your asking something and you getan answer just so you shut the hell up. With all the ""realism"" claims PUBG still has no bullet penetration..... I mean of course you could count the desyncs maybe as bulletpenetration ))) sometimes they work for you sometimes for the enemy.Although I would RECOMMEND this game the greedy developers have to receive a bad mark from me ).PUBG isn't a low budget beta game developed by a small indie company anymore the quality of the game is sub standard so a big NONO from me.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Obviously there are still going to be people buying the game just not as many but people thought buying into it that this was just the alpha version and that the game would continue to get better after this huge influx of cash. I'm so tired of seeing game devs put out games in early access and get tons of money then take the money and run and totally on their player base. With the amount of money they've made we should totally expect much MUCH better graphics better animations better gun play on the level of destiny many more maps with great servers for each area obviously without asking there needs to be a system in place for hackers/cheaters (DUH) more weapons and items to play with and last but not least all the bugs consistantly removed with better optimization. There is no excuse for the devs to be so greedy and go after the mobile market before finishing the game that game them this opportunity. BE GOOD TO THE PEOPLE THAT MADE YOU RICH!!!!!! Its sad this isn't the case.Review This game is decent but not worth your time or money with the current state of the game. There are major issues with hackers that isn't being addressed witch obviously is a huge problem. When playing before the hackers took over the game was only fun in spurts by yourself but this was better with a few friends but still after a few hours it gets super repeatitive. Grab guns hoping luck is on your side and run. If your unlucky you will be in a running simulator for about 5 mins before being out gunned by someone camping the bush or building your running twards while trying to out run the death circle. Its not fun atleast half the time and needs a lot of time and map studying to make it enjoyable for a few hours. Unless you have a friend willing to play every match with you dont get this game until the devs put some serious effort into fixing and finishing the game.

2017-07-26,0,0,48,True,Recommended,Best battle royale game out there currently. Very fun fast paced 100 player free for all with more content maps and weapons soon on the way. I cant wait to see what they add to this already great game. Most issues lag ect with the game people are complaining about is simply because they don't have a proper PC or internet connection to support this game. Its popular and anyone with a 300$ Dell thinks they can max it out with 60 fps no problem and because that is not going to happen they bash it and try to call it a bad game with server issues... I wish I was exaggerating. If you can run this game and are interested in something like this to pass the time you will not be dissappointed I wasnt.EDIT it is worth mentioning that it does take a considerable amount of time to acquire the ingame currency you use to buy clothing for your character the best strategy for getting said currency is just grinding out solo games and getting a decent kill count early on even if you die you get 20points a kill which adds up pretty quick along with the match and rank bonuses.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-06-12,0,0,133,True,Recommended,For all us H1Z1 Veterans out there i know i wasn't the only one scared to pick this up. I was scared thinking was going to be an exact clone of h1z1 until i saw footage and gameplay and saw that this was 100x better then h1z1. If you are one of those people scared to pick it up or just don't think you'd enjoy it... Trust me... it's worth the price tag. It's a very fun balanced BR game. The graphics are very pretty. If you like shooters and you like military sim games kind of you'd love this. What is PUBG? PUBG is a Br(Battle Royale) you can just thyink of the hunger games and that's pretty much what this is you against 99 other players on this big island you parachute in find loot guns medical supplies armour vechiles and you race to the safe zone while fighting 99 other players your goal is to be the last man standing or last team.. there is teams duo and 4 man team called Squad.

2017-10-30,0,0,186,False,Not Recommended,I have quite a lot of hours in this game and so do many others and without I doubt me and most players would realise how consistently incoherent this game is. This game is was released over a year ago and yet little to no effort has been put towards optimising the game and actually making it a trustworthy gaming experience. Every gunfight I'm absolutely terrified to involve myself in it as most of the time I have an abrupt frame drop or if I'm lucky the game combusts and I'm left running into nothingness for ages according to my teammates. I wouldn't mind so much if these problems were new as I would hope that they would be fixed within a few weeks but no these are problems I've had for as long as I've had the game. The driving physics for any variant of the motorbikes are absolutely terrifying every single time you have to edge off the road as usually due to poor map design an almost incomprehensible sharp bump in the landscape sends you flying. Good design. This game is not worth its price tag. I absolutely hate Fortnite but I have more respect for that game than this. They provide a free game with the same micro transaction system as PUBG almost rid of bugs and glitches and regularly improve the game. In my opinion this game should be free until they can make a stable game. Almost every moment of the game is not fun and the one moment that it is actually fun the gunfights it starts to break and you're left with a frozen screen of you shooting. Nice gameplay.

A clear example of this is the last game I played where my gun was shooting at the roof when i was clearly aiming at him.

Chinese cheaters have quite literally laid domain to the NA servers. mostly TPP but FPP still has a good amount. (""dont want to be xenophoic tho"" tard Dev actually said this)3. netcode/ desync is the worse I've ever seen and I've got 1500 hours in R6 Siege. 4. They keep pushing out maps yet the other 3 glaring problems still exist. Snow map?!?!? I can hardly have one gratifying game on the current maps and youre talking about a ing snow map? to me the devs of this game are trying to attract as many new players as possible before people realise that the core of this game is fundamentally weak and in need of some serious work.

2018-07-08,0,0,235,False,Not Recommended,"What many won't say is that this game actually is very fun to play. The mechanics of the game do in fact make this one of the most fun challenging (yet still satisfying) and interesting shooter games I have ever played. The combat is engaging and truly thrilling at times. You can even earn a few cents by playing the game buying crates with ""Battlepoints"" you earn by killing damaging and getting higher ranks and selling these crates.However this initial addictive quality of the game quickly leads to its downfall. Soon you find out that your primary motivation for playing the game is getting crates which are losing more and more of their market value. Games lose their appeal with repetition and you soon find that you no longer want to play solo. The development of PUBG a game so promising and clearly the most popular game to ever be on Steam seems to be slowing down over time even though the replayability of PUBG just isn't there. This is reflected in PUBG's waning peak players. For months there was a flood of hackers in the games that is arguably still persistent today. This game is frusturating. This game is hard. And you might think that you want the challenge that you want to sink the hundreds or even thousands of hours in just to get better. But really it ends there. Rare event modes might get you on for a few more fresh engaging hours once in a while but these were really just desperate attempts at bandaiding the problem instead of adding more actual modes. A billion dollar game is refusing to expand development. A map that takes 4x less work to make (it is 4x4 km instead of the 8x8 km other two maps) still took months to come out. If you're looking for a game that will improve and will keep you coming back for more look elsewhere. This game is definitely not worth $30. You may think that it'll pay for itself and that is true in the past this game could pay for itself. But now it's just not worth it. If you can get this game for under $15 then I would say that it might be worth a try. But otherwise save your money. This is a game that will soon go the way of H1Z1.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I have died countless times at the beginning of games by frantically dragging weapons and ammo into my inventory only to find that they just refuse to get picked up resulting in some enemy looting it first and killing me. 7/10,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2018-01-29,18,1,329,False,Recommended,The Game itself is both Fun and Stressing. Its fun because you paired up with 99 other people fighting for the death. A decent selection of guns and Risky things like Landmarks and Carepackage drops. Now it's stressing because of Chinese players getting into other servers Im not the one discriminating some of them are. I get teamkilled sometimes But a few of those times are me getting killed by someone 1 time being 2 of them because I can't communicate with my squadmates. The game still has a handful of bugs and glitches and can run very badly even for decent PCs but to be fair The game is made by modders. TL DRGame is addictive But I just Recommend playing in Solo most of the time if you dont have friends to play with.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-06-30,0,0,174,False,Not Recommended,I played quite a bit of the game back when it was still in early access. Those days were great playing with friends. I enjoyed the wins we got in squads and the few wins I got in solos. Initially I wrote a review about this game back when it was still in early access and then edited that review when the full release came around. I've since deleted that review because of how outdated it was.Since the official release of the game I've played less and less. I play very little of it with my friends anymore and we only play it because it's one of the few multiplayer games we all share. The game has always been clunky whether it's the movement or looting mechanics. The games tend to be slow and have very little uptime. Even if you hot drop and win at the hot drop there's little action left for the rest of the game since people tend to spread out a lot and play safe. You actively have to look for action and that means putting yourself at risk for losing the game. The gun play is probably the best part about the game. It feels smooth most of the time and they tend to play well. The problem comes with the actual guns themselves. The attachments tend to be a problem since gunfights melt down into whoever has the better or most attachments on their gun. And then should you win that fight and the other person had a gun you prefer to use without the attachments you have to take the time yourself to take the attachments off the gun you have currently to then switch the guns out and put the attachments on the new gun. It's a tiresome ordeal and can lead into a loss should you get caught out. There are games out there currently that automatically switch attachments out should you switch guns and also put on the attachments to your guns when you pick them up.Depending on what maps you play on the mobility on the side of the player is severely lacking. Car spawns aren't the best and even if you should get a car they're loud and give away your position. Not only that they leave you as a sitting duck in most situations. They offer little protection and aren't very durable in fights. There aren't any movement mechanics outside of cars besides health boosts giving you extra movement speed should you pass a threshold.Speaking of boosts the mechanic isn't fun. Medical supplies are meant to help you after fights that you've won. The fact that I have to hold the main medical supplies as well as more smaller meds doesn't feel good. On top of that unlike most of the main meds boosts don't heal instantly. They tick leaving you vulnerable and wishing for the last 25Hp you couldn't heal to with the main meds unless you have the med kit. Med kits are rare take up a lot of inventory space and slow to use. Overall it slows down fights and makes the game even more tedious. If you don't get boosts in the beginning of the game it feels like the game's been lost. Awful mechanic. Everything in PUBG is slow and tedious. The risk/reward gameplay is severely imbalanced with people that play aggressively winning early loot but possibly losing late fights to people that are set up in better positions and playing slow. The maps don't feel good to play with the original feeling the best to play on out of them all. If you're looking for realistic then I guess this is for you. If you're looking for good look elsewhere.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-06,0,0,511,False,Not Recommended,"Reverse the below text it is from an old review when it was still being worked on (as in updates that didnt just add a new skin)Overall this game is fun. I have tried playing it ""competitively"" with friends trying to get that yummy chicken dinner and have also had some games where we just mess around. I hope that the potential that i see in this game comes to life later in the development process. Pros Fun to play with friends Rewarding to kill people (since it is not easy nor hard goldie locks with a pretty good balance of weapons) Good risk reward system (getting the supply drops can change the game by giving you an edge against other playersCons Optimization i know it is early in the development but with a gtx 970 you would think that it could handle this game with minimal drops in framerate. However they have improved it with the updates gaining me about 10 fps boost it still needs work. Bullets can get stuck in stupid things like stair railings making it luck to shoot in between them Spawn rates of some guns still need to be fixed (some buildings have A LOT of guns in them while others right next to them don't even have a pistol this results in it being luck based and not giving people a chance since if someone gets an AR shotgun or a SMG while you have a melee weapon it's not a fair fight)Wants for the future Search options so that when you want to play on a rainy day you can select it and not just rely on luck. This would be an issue increasing game search times but could vastly improve game experience since sometimes you don't want it to be raining Allow people to rejoin after disconnection due to game crashing or internet issues. I have had so many games where me or one of my friends gets kicked early on when we had just found really good loot but then we choose to abandon as to not leave them out (their character should stay where they last were and they CAN be shot and killed by an enemy or team member making it fair since they are vulnerable while they attempt to reconnect.

Some Dumbass at the report desk replied with some ""potential solutions"". The list of potential solutions was the I had already tried and told them I tried... 0/10 Do Noy BuyI like the actual gameplay and have played the game for over 100 hours. However first problem I was met with a bug that caused my game to crash majourity of the time I launched it or when I was loading after a game was done. (Note I had played for 100 hours before this crash bug was a thing...) Second I just logged in to see challanges in the style of fortnite which I like only to realize they copied the whole premium pass thing too on a $40 (CDN) game... And not only are there $12 premium passes fornite style... they have $13 crates... Point is the game is now riddled with microtransactions F2P style. I remember when they were adding crates that you got through PLAYING THE GAME and you could open them for FREE. Devs became so money hungry. Third problem is about gameplay. Game is still unoptimized. They are adding all these microtransactions but still no good optimization. Forth problem is how a lot of Asia players play on NA servers. It creates problems with ping and such. Also a lot more hackers are in NA mm due to that problem. Gonna leave it on this.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2018-07-02,0,0,964,False,Not Recommended,I absoultely love this game and sunk a whopping 800+ hours in but i can without a doubt in my mind say DON'T BUY THIS GAME. I get the game has a small dev team and they never expected it to grow to the size that it did but at the same time that massive growth was also followed by a massive amount of profit. There should be no reason for the problems from over a year ago to still be popping their ugly heads but they are. The release of Sanhock made the game feel great again(for about twwo weeks) but just like the old ex the trubled pasts snuck up agin all the old problems have returned with vengance ie Dysnc/LAg.If you like your multiplayer games to feel fluid and precise then don't buy this game in its current state. The amout of times youll take damge or be shot around corners is more than any one man/woman should have to deal with especially with one that is trying to become a esports game. Maybe if the devs could ever come up with a soultion to fix their broken game or at least attach a bandaid they could swap out on a regular basis to make the game a half enjoyable experience agian then you should think about spending your cash on this product but till then DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

This does make most of the players extremely frustrated and a lot of my squad mates quit over the excessive number of hackers.Bottom Line Is the game good? YesDo you recommend it at current state?

2018-06-25,0,0,202,False,Not Recommended,The issue with PUBG is that the developers honestly dont care about this game. When the game was still relitivly new instead of optimising the game and fixing bugs bluehole decided to add micro transactions and sell the game on as many consols as they could. Now the game is however old and bluehole still refuses to fix the bugs and instead makes new maps so as to try increase the player base instead of fixing issues that the existing player base face.Despite this issue the game is still relitivly addictive and fun but it has so much more potential. sadly i dont think it will ever be as good as it can be as the developers dont care enough to put any effort into fixing these issues.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-10-07,0,0,28,True,Recommended,I remember when DayZ was hyped for being innovative and ahead of its time. DayZ had several problems it was on Arma's engine it had zombies with bad AI and it was difficult to find guns. It sucked dying in DayZ. In PUBG all of these problems are fixed. More of a stealthy player? Stay around the circle edges and creep in. Want gunplay instead? Jump into the most populated zones and play there instead.Few games make the game loop based on rewarding performance and making you want to continue playing these days. They give you XP levels and all sorts of other ways to make you play. PUBG just makes the gameplay loop addicting fun and challenging. It's a game where you can actually make an effort to get better and be rewarded. It's great.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-09-06,0,0,1192,False,Recommended,My original review was of early access and I had quite a few hours in. At the time I said I would recommend the game and I stand by that. I'm now almost 800 hours invested. I have played solos (only won one) and lots of duos and squad games (won many). There is nothing quite like winning a chicken dinner and having all your squad mates make it to the end or clutching a win for your team when you thought all was lost. The gun play in this game is unlike anything else when you have a group of friends (or make new ones through randoms) that you enjoy playing with the experience PUBG offers for me is unrivaled. However this is the most infuriating game I have ever played. When it works it works well but when the warts show through they show through hard. And there is lots of rage! Some people deal better than others but the rage can take the shine off real quick. PUBG have continued to improve the game since 1.0 they've been steadily improving the stability and continuing to add content. Some of their decisions aren't popular with everybody but that's the way this goes. I've more than got my monies worth out of the game and I will continue to play it as we get map selection an upcoming map and changes to and additions to weapons and attachments.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

You will be dissapointed after almost ever round.Apparently developers have no way of stopping hackers. Instead they are manually banning cheaters in waves about a few thousand every week. They have banned over 1.5 million cheaters so far but they keep changing their hacks and repurchasing the game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-10-22,0,0,10,True,Not Recommended,At first I was REALLY into this game. Its has some an interesting concept and some cool ideas. It was great to have a multiplayer game that was just fun and not so serious (like CS GO). BUT once the novelty wears off frustration quickly sets in and you realize why this game just has too many issues to be enjoyed long term. This was my first and last early access game NEVER AGAIN. Because even the best of the best of early access just has too many issues for me to be bothered. Now that the developer has already made its money why should they keep spending money to fix the problems? Nothing has improved since I bought the game 3 months ago. Here's my list of issues CONS The aiming mechanics are just plain bad and inconsistent Why in the devils do I have to doubleclick to zoom? grenade physics are inconsistent too. sometimes they just fell in place off the wall and sometimes they ricochet HACKERS. The best I scored previously was 4th place. The best I've scored in the last 3 days 25th. Servers are inconsistently laggy. And sometimes it put me in an Asian server even when I had NA checked. PC optimization is pretty poor. I have to set it down to low settings just to barely reach a stable 30 FPS. I can play much more demanding games on medium+ at a stable 45 FPS. no killcam. The environment is really big. Might as well have been struck by lightning the loot should be spread around a bit more evenly. some buildings have nothing and some have an entire loadout the game is too dependant on luck lots of running around and then you see one guy and you both try to shoot and throw nades until God farts and someone dies sometimes the game wont let me use med kits even though they are in my inventory. VERY FRUSTRATINGIn its current state the game is broken. Now that it is such an early access hit I highly doubt they will fix it. because NOTHING has been improved in the 3 months I've owned it.

2017-12-29,0,0,343,False,Not Recommended,I have enjoyed the game and the concept. However as it stands the game is not worth your time due to the amount of cheating on all servers/regions. It feels like the situation is rapidly spiralling out of control for the developers. I have come to expect a small amount of hacking in all competitive FPS games but the replay and deathcam feature has revealed that it is a severe issue. Playing a game where I do not suspect cheating now only occurs in a minority of cases. I've moved to other similar games now where the situation is a more level playing field. At this rate I think gaming history will only remember PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds as a case study in development and popularity and I can imagine that soon enough more games of this type will enter the market with better anti cheating features and more stable optimisation.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-10-28,0,0,549,False,Not Recommended,There's little to say that hasn't already been said about why this game is bad in terms of bugs desync etc. I mean what dev team has to launch a campaign against their own game to have it fixed!?In short it teases you with legitimate greatness and then utterly lets you down with a problem to the point where you have to stop playing for your own health. You have to have the highest potential to let people down so badly and this game still does. It has amazing weapon balance and fundamental aim mechanics with a pacing that keeps you coming back again and again (on Sanhok that is). But the biggest disappointment will always be something which could have been the best in principle but just does not pull it off. I always try to be the first to blame myself for dying (after a rage or two) but after going on a great run entering a new game and then dying because you don't hear an enemy parachute land near Alt+F4 is sometimes all a competitive person can do to stay sane. The most entertaining part of this game has become that the devs can do more things wrong than they can right. Even after the recent problems with region lock they gave away free BP and items... which I received twice. Every bug resolution creates 3 more it seems.All problems aside the reason the devs deserve hard criticism and mockery in reality is that they have pushed in game purchases on people and hosted esports tournies before truly investing in fixing their game or providing new content. They could re write their whole game on a different engine if they wanted to with the money they've made but don't want to take the hit. We could have 5 or 6 maps with varied loot but instead we have Halloween skin purchases. We could be rewarded for all the hours we've spent with decent free weapon skins but all I can seem to unlock without paying more money is the Beige lot. Don't buy this game unless you are content with being disregarded and losing to random chance in a title that is aimed at being a simulator. Let's hope EA and Battlefield can do something amazing with their Frostbite engine.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-04-01,0,0,581,False,Not Recommended,"Well time for my 100+ hour review. The TLDR is dont waste your money. This game has been out for over a year ans is still entirely broken. How you may ask? Well lets delve into some of the many shortcomings with this game.First lets start with the netcode. It is absolutely trash. Im fairly certian cats walking across a row of keyboards for a month could produce a far superior netcode than PlayerUnknown ever did. Well how bad is the netcode? Well ever wanted to be shot by someone after running behind a building? Well this game offeres exactly that! I cant even cout on my toes and fingers the ammount of times i have been getting shot at run into cover to only be knocked out or killed behind cover from the same player who has no angle on me. Why you ask because crappy netcode! Going back and watching thew kill cam is even more infruriating to see the player aming 5 ft behind you yet still landing shots. Second this game is filled with so many bugs and glitches. From not being able to use in game voice to rocks on mountains not being solid and allowing you to fall inot spots that are almost impossible to get out of to my absolute favorite issue with this game. The crashes. This game crashes on a daily basis multiple times a day. and before you say ""Zach your pc must be trash."" or ""Zach have you verified your game files?"" My pc is a 6700k and a 1070. Theres no reason i shouldnt be able to run this game and i have no issues with any other games i play. Also yes i have verified my game files no problems there either. SO if its not the game files and its not the computer it must be the game. So your game crashes it give you a pop up saying hey i crashed now you gotta close the popup and re launch the game then reload the map and hope that youre not running to your certian death when you get back. That is if you dont have desync issues when you get back in. 2 games in a row tonight i had desync issues where my teammates saw me sitting still doing nothing meanwhile on my screen im right beside them. Durring one of these fun desync issues i was killed by the blue zone while on my screen i was in the next circle. Of course the desync issue relates back to my first point as well. Now if this game was still in early access (which it needs to be) i wouldnt be so upset with this game. However it is in full release and its full of issues. Which is entirely unaccepctable in my opinion. But you must think PUBG Corp must be looking into these problems right? Wrong! They are too busy making new clothing and weapon skins to line thier wallets more than focusing on fixing what is horribly broken. If PUBG Corp were to release this for free tomorrow would i reccomend it? Again no i would suggest people to stay away and very far away and try something like Fortnite or Radical Heights. While they are cartoony and not the same style as PUBG. Fortnite at least has a propper functioning netcode. When you die it makes sense where as in PUBG youre left scratching your head as to how did that player even hit me? And Radical Heights is listed as ""Extreme"" Early Access so even if there is issues and bugs you know that its to be expected due to its current state of the game. My only regret with this game is not returning it sooner and getting my $30 back and spending on a game/ dev team who actually cares about their game and not just lining their pockets with that fat loot box money.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

You get a significant less amount of BP when on teams and the crates are extremely over priced in value I think they are doing this so that people will eventually have to pay for crates with the most likely chance of absolute trash please please PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!!!!!!!!!!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-10-17,0,0,1449,False,Recommended,I love it how people are still crying about the gambling aspect of the crates when the last crate they released was over 2 months ago. And they are now just promoting buying the thing without gambling for it. I myself think the event pass was a good addition but maybe a little overpriced next time they should be 5/6 bucks not 10. The event pass gave the players who have played the game for a long time now a new adventure and a challenge which made the game more enjoyable and gave them a new experience by letting them do something else instead of what they're always doing.PUBG has changed a lot over the last year. A lot less bugs and (compared to last year) good optimisation (still sh*t compared to other games). But it's not a full priced triple A title and its made in Unreal Engine (known for being harsh on some opperating systems). So you gotta atleast give it a chance.Minimum Requirements are a tad bit outdated i think. With a 960 you should be playing medium settings 60 fps. I think you can play with a GTX 670 and get 60 fps on very low. Just do your research if your computer can handle it.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-05-21,0,0,1366,False,Not Recommended,TL DR This game had potential but it is not worth the money anymore. Garbage game.It started off as the pinnacle of battle royale games putting to shame H1Z1 or ARK. Early access it was obviously unready but it was still fun to play and there were no microtransactions. It was hard to run but the potential for the game was high. So much could have been done to improve it and make it a competitor for AAA games.But then the devs got greedy and made it into a money farm. The game came out in December of 2017 and still today is very unoptimized. I see that there are indeed new game modes and maps to try and combat this but it is too little too late. This game in its current engine will most likely never reach a level of optimization that is acceptable for the amount of time that has past since the launch date. With the introduction of loot boxes this game has just become a cash grab. Not to mention that since it has been on the Steam store it has never gone on sale.Overall it was fun in the beginning but the disrespect from developers to consumers with the introduction of microtransactions has sent this game towards its grave.P.S Don't even get me started on the whole cheating situation. That is another conversation.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

After the realse of 1.0 my rig got 30 to 40 fps boost. recently two month they improved the anti cheat so everyday pubg will have two around 25mb update to prevent hacking. From my personal gaming experience i would say it worked. I encountered much less hackers than before they release the anti cheat update. A lot of negative reviews came from the hackers got banned. Base on the effort developer made i would change my review to recommend this game. Certainly the game is nowhere near perfect and it still needs a lot of fixes.

2018-09-01,1,1,590,False,Not Recommended,The idea of the game is very good but its just horribly programmed wherefore its completely laggy inconsistent and has a performance in general. Bullets are magically dissolving enemies are often rubberbanding all over the place and most oddly the bullets you shoot are coming from your characters fingers instead of your gun barrel. As a result of that you cant lay down and shoot on an enemy while being in front of a little hill for example. Your crosshairs is right on the enemy and you have free sight but the bullets are just going into the hill because as i mentioned the bullets are coming out of your fingers and therefore from a lower point than it is actually displayed. Absolutely frustrating! Additionally the game is crashing all the time with no bug report shown on my computer. Most annyoing thing is that people with a better ping are always in advantage. When having a worse ping than the enemy it is almost impossible to shoot first. I am often having the issue that I am shooting at someone multiple times and on the deathcam there is no shot recorded on the enemy even though there have been blood splatters on my screen. So where did my bullets go? They are no longer in my magazine. But in order to shoot at someone you need a weapon first which is sometimes acutally really hard to find with this games' inconsistency. For that reason it happens almost every third game that you are landing and searching futilely for a weapon. Meanwhile the enemy is landing on a weapon rushing towards you and killing you where there is nothing you can do about that because you are just not finding a weapon. Again really frustrating. Last the community of this game is really bad. There are so many people just camping in toilets or corners for instance which makes it really hard to play the game properly.I really regret buying this game. The game developers give a about their community and refuse to fix their game for which they demand 30 bucks on steam. Pathetic! At the moment I can only advise everyone to not buy this game it is maybe worth 2 bucks at most right now.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-03-30,0,0,146,False,Not Recommended,Single handedly the most frustrating rage inducing foul mood causing game I personally have ever played for all the following reasons. You make it to top 10 wiped out single shot in the head by someone with a suped up Kar98K with an 8x scope. You first FIRST DIRECTLY at your target they kill you first. No matter how aware you are how tactical you are what technique you use how careful you are you will be thrashed immediately. Somehow at close range your accuracy suffers when you fire from the hip at someone's face they kill you first. 80% of the time unless you go into a major settlement you will find next to little or loot that is not good enough. You will be the first to die out of 100 players a lot of the time. The vehicle physics are clunky and difficult to control when driving cross country. On the move you exit the vehicle you will be killed or have half your health taken from you when landing on the ground. Somehow other players snap straight onto you and go guns blazing. You try the same they kill you first. While the bullet drop physics are well made they somehow don't apply to other players. Other players 70% of the time have the upper hand. Movement physics are awkward when trying to enter buildings in a rush. You end up spamming F to pick up 1 or 2 items but it takes upwards of 10 seconds occasionally for them to appear in your inventory. When picking up loot and the above is hapening to you you will be killed. Other players can follow you into smaller areas gain the upper hand and kill you. Most likely infested with cheaters. Rinse repeat again and again and again. Over and over. Poor optimisation for PC. I'm currently running an i7 6850K 16 gigs of RAM and a GTX1060. I should be able to max this game out but it drops into mid 30s on occasion and wouldn't peak above mid 80s depending on location and views. Dropping 1 or 2 settings down to high though significantly improves performance.Do not carry on playing this game if a few of the above if not most if not even ALL of the above apply to you. You will NOT enjoy playing this game even with friends. It's not worth it carrying on playing if you fall into a s***streak. And at the time of typing this 27 for this? Bearing in mind the above? Are you joking? I should not have carried on owning this game and putting this many hours into it for this long or else I could have got my money back....,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2018-06-29,0,0,88,False,Not Recommended,Even though this game can be an absolute blast to play there are still so many problems in this game that hold it back hardcore from being recommended.First off the optimization (OH GOD WHY!!!!!????????) I have a gtx 1070ti and this game still struggles to run smoothly and if you have something worse than a 750 this game will run worse than a turtle missing it's 2 back legs and don't even get me started on the Xbox port2nd point is lag There are some cases where you randomly teleport around and is a real problem when you are under fire3rd point and last point is the stupid god awful event pass This really is a stupid and terrible descision and would have only worked if you could potentially re new it for free but no you have to pay everytime an event ends.Overall this game in it's current state is something you should stay far away from.EDIT I would mention that this game has some poor graphics contrary to what some of my friends say (saying this looks like a ps2 game is the biggest insult to the beautiful mgs3) however it was made by one guy so I can't be too harsh on the graphics but I will be harsh on everything else now that it is out of early access the problems that I have mentioned are not acceptable for full release even if it was made by one guy,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-04-22,0,0,251,True,Recommended,"These ""Put you in a circle and try to come out on top"" games have been on the rise but PUBG is clearly one of the best even in its early access stage. At the rate this game is going I believe it's full access stage is gonna be on par with PU's Arma 3 Battle Royale mod. Gun Play / PVP The gun play in this game is well balanced. Every gun feels strong and the only time I have ever felt outmatched is when someone has a gun from a care package drop or when I'm outranged which rarely happens as you typically find better guns as the game progresses. At the start of the game everybody drops from the plane and heads towards the closest town or base they can make it to and typically scavenge for a gun or look for a car. If you're lucky enough to find a gun in the first building you run into you are pretty much set as long as you have good aim. The game has bullet travel and drop which makes it harder to hit a mobile target at longer ranges but you dont really have to worry about that if the other player is standing still.On the topic of melee weapons they're not very useful even after you land. The only melee weapon with a real use has to be the pan which blocks bullets while it's on your back.And the armor in this game surely does help. You're going to want to constantly look out for higher tier armor than what you have (Highest tier is 3)Currently the game has 4 assault rifles (AKM M16a3 SCAR L M416) 4 sniper rifles (AWM Kar98 SKS M24) 4 smgs (UMP UZI Vector Tommy Gun) 4 Melee Weapons (Crowbar Machete Pan Sickle)3 shotguns (S12K S1897 S686)3 Pistols (P1911 P92 R1895)3 Grenades (Smoke Frag Stun)1 Novelty weapon (Crossbow)1 LMG (M249)And a bunch of attachments Vehicles When it comes to vehicles in this game they're pretty rare. However they typically spawn in the same spots always facing East (From what it seems). Currently in game there 5 are vehicles in game.Dacia (Car)Buggy2x UAZ (Jeep w/ and w/o top)Motorbike w/ sidecar (w/o sidecar coming soon)Boat The Map The map in this game is huge it has so many different places to explore its amazing. But there are hardly any environmental changes. The only big environment change is when it starts to rain but thats it. I think this game could benefit if they added a night time mode in which attachments like lasers lights and laser/light combos spawned and gear such as NVGs. A selection of more than 1 map would be pretty cool but the map thats currently in the game is really well made. Performance and Server issues Now to what brings this game down. The servers have seen improvements but they still can be pretty abismal at times. As far as performance goes I drop frames on medium settings with my GTX 1080. There is no V Sync toggle in the menus and you have to delve into the config to change some important settings. But the team is actively working on increasing performance and I can say that it has improved slightly since launch. TL DR What the game needs (Final Verdict) I made a small list based on what I personally believe this game should definitely add and improve on More settings (V Sync advanced video etc.) Improvements on the servers Some more guns! Different maps More environmental changes more oftenOverall I give this game an 8/10 I really enjoy playing it.Sorry for the long review lol",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-23,1,1,273,False,Recommended,So after reading many Rewieves about Playerunknown's Battlegrounds i want to give you guys my neutral opinion on this game.Let s start with the pros The game costs 30 Euros which is a fair price. The game gets updated pretty often and creators are really trying to fix bugs and other negative aspects which may appear from time to time in game (lag random car explosions etc. ...)The Menu of the game is easy to understand you can find everything from settings to starting the game less in a sec although you have never played the game and joining lobbies and playing with friends works very good and quick.Further more the idea of the game is it s biggest pro. You really feel like being in the game and the adrenalin kick you get when you are the last one in your team or when your fighting the last enemie is just insane. BUT before buying this game now you really have to pay attention towards the cons.The graphics are okay but in comparison to games like Witcher 3 and so on they look pretty You need a good PC for playing it on decent grahicsettings otherwise your fps will go negative. The game requires a really good PC setup to get fps over 100. It pretty much means when you buy PUBG you can buy a new PC too.The servers feel like being run by potatos. In the beginning of the game your lagging permanent your getting teleported and it takes years to open doors and pick up stuff and guns expecially on places where many players are dropping at the same time.The movement system is bad it feels like gravity just don t want to work sometimes. Expecially jumping sucks.As in some reviews said shotguns are the new snipers and can shoot and hit over 100 km.Sometimes the game just closes itself randomly and more than 50 percent of the looses you will get is caused by the Zone. You can be the best player ever in PUBG you may be better than Shroud haha anyways the biggest noob ever can easely win against you just by having Zone luck. To sum up yes the game sucks in many ways nevertheless you should give it a shot and try it out. If the producers can manage to fix those bugs and perfomance laggs (before putting tones of new stuff in it) than it might be the best game ever. I mean there must be something special about it when almost 3.000.000 players are playing this game at the same time everyday ).Thanks for paying attention i hope i made your decision easier.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

In my opinion Blueballs knows they can't fix it so they're trying to grab as much cash as they can before any of the coming bigger BR games drop and kill the player base even more.

2018-11-23,0,0,119,False,Recommended,PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds is an online multiplayer battle royale game that you can play alone or with friends. You can play on multiple maps and choose between first person or third person perspective. 99 players parachute down from a plane on to the map and try to survive by going through buildings and searching for loot. And staying alive and not letting the deadly blue zone or player kill you. The game is fun and somewhat addicting. You have the option to customize your character and guns. The game is somewhat playable thanks to the recent bug fixes and apparently it is E sports read. Finding a game is somewhat fast but encountering your first battle or finding your fist loot takes time do to waiting till everybody joins and waiting till you parachute down. The game is full of microtransactions but thankfully the game is not play to win you can only buy cosmetics and cases. The game has a problem with cheaters especially in the Asian region. Inconclusion I recommend this game and the developers are actively fixing bugs. I personally haven t encountered any game braking bugs.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

However the new map is awful as near the end game there is no cover and it comes down to where ever you landed at the start and if the side you landed on has any cover. You cannot predict where the circle lands so when people land play and finally go to the end game circle the chances are very slim that the tradectory from your point of land and the end game circle support cover.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-02-17,0,0,376,False,Not Recommended,There are so many hackers that you cannot win a game.I feel like i'm underexaggerating when I say that so let me be more specific. There are so many hackers that 99% of the time the first person you see will be a hacker. There is basically no way to beat them if they have line of sight your only hope is to cook a perfect grenade hope they are still there and then bounce it into whatever room they're in. This doesn't work in most situations because most of the time you'll be at a distance.Besides killing them without line of sight you can try hacking yourself which at the moment there seems to be no reason not to since there is from what I can tell no cheat detection in this game and an abundance of hacks easier to find than a Minecraft letsplay.Sure PUBG sued that one 14 year old kid for hacking but that is 1 out of the 26 million people that play this game. Plus they were just setting an example and probably won't do it again.The hackers ruin the game as like a cherry on top of everything else that is bad don't buy PUBG. It sucks.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-07-16,0,0,312,False,Not Recommended,Honestly I think they should fix all the issues with it currently rather than try to spam content and apps to catch up or compare with Fortnite. Hackers are still a huge problem game still pretty glitchy with bugs everywhere. Hits don't register still pretty laggy hacker game of the year get killed by other people when they can't see you but I guess ping wins the game. They are trying to fight fortnite for money thats all it is and in turn aren't paying attention to the real issues. Fortnite wouldn't be such a problem if this game wasn't so broken as it stands. The servers are STILL a problem I might add you get disconnected consistently even when in games. Almost after every game you get disconnected and have to fight the server to reconnect. To add on we lost the weather which I thought was awesome and added an extra feel to the game. I still enjoy the game and play it with friends however this game is slowly going to hell. Its no longer about the PLAYER it's about the MONEY. Devs need to get out of their pockets and back into this game fix it get rid of the hackers clean up your servers THEN add new content and focus on competition with other games. Getting killed by a mile away with a grenade and the servers kicking you out after every match is a little old now since this is a fully released game now. Hits do not even register even if its a direct hit and there is blood the game gives you a middle finger. Game is pretty broken as it stands and I wouldn't spend that amount of money on this game in its current condition. It is sad to see how PUBG is becoming ever since other developers came out with similar games. I play this game often but recently it is unplayable with some BS happening EVERY game with one of the many issues it currently has. I mean cars blowing up when you nudge a fence that you can ram through anyway? ing wasted 30 minutes of my life and all that effort gone thanks. As I said it isn't about the player it is about the addons and the money. Don't give them the satisfaction just go play fornite or one of the many other battleground related games.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

After this update M16 was four times more resilient than SKS. Three heads were gone. I searched half a big E city to find a base for three heads. If you modify the game do you have to do a game ahead of time to investigate the situation of the game. You think the desert map is big and you want to speed up the game change the time and speed of the poison circle. Then you get the scolded dog blood. You'll change it. This version you add the wild area. Take the more rich buildings in the big city. Do you think the game is fast or slow? M16 has been chipped. I can't see it. Talk about the three level head. The three level is our group of ordinary players against the strongest stuff. You think the game is going. Will we only be beaten after we encounter plug ins? If you want to overcome your luck with technology can you fight the same equipment with your mother? She scolded the technology with your heart.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-05-11,0,0,393,True,Recommended,"Really enjoying this game so far. This is the first game from the ""Battle Royale"" genre I've ever played and one of the few early access games I've bought.While there isn't much content in the game the enjoyment comes from the experience the game offers. PUBG provides an intense thrilling experience with its' ""Battle Royale"" style gameplay. Players are dropped onto a map with 99 other players and must be the last one alive to win. To survive you must kill or hide from enemy players and find the gear/loot necessary to help yourself achieve victory all while the playable arena shrinks via a blue gas cloud like wall which is constantly pushing players into eachother.PUBGs loot system avoids crafting and instead offers a customisable experience through attachable modifications for weapons and leveled gear. This system ensures that each play session is different and adds a surprising amount of depth to the gameplay. The combat is a mix between 3rd and 1st person shooting using ARMAs engine to achieve realistic feeling gun play and difficult but rewarding kills. This coupled with the loot system creates the possibilty of varied play styles. Which players must adapt to based on what gear they're lucky enough to find.This game would appeal to competitive players most of all. Perhaps not the best game for a casual player or one who typically plays offline. There is a steep learning curve and a high skill ceiling. But once you get into it (and hopefully win!) it really is something else.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-13,0,0,128,False,Not Recommended,I actually loved this game but now is getting pretty yHere's some reasons why Full game that has a price and a Temporary rewards progression system (You can now progress and earn TEMPORARY itens that will dissapear after some time even if you paid to get them lol ) Battle Pass with a price even if the game isn't free to play Lots and lots of bugs even after alpha launch Game still have A LOT of performance issues. I got a Razer Blade and can barely play on the lowest settings without getting some frame drops (averaga fps 70 depending on the humour of the game) Servers still suck. How dare you release events with third and first person only on some servers ? Does that mean that I just payed 30 dollars to play FULL GAME that doesn't even have my favorite game mode on my continent server? (First person on South America) No regards to the community. Enough with the constant lootboxes already. You guys are literally sucking Shroud and Dr Disrespect Diccks so they remain streaming the game. Even when they also hate all of the performance issues bugs and so on. The engine sucks and the anti cheat is even worse. Come on guys. You made abut 200 million on this game. Get your head out of your asss. Put some more money and effort to the game. Hit detection system. Somehow the biggest joke of the game. Lost a lot of 30 min matches just because someone on the other end was lagged and didn t get the shot in the head that i just made on them. better tickrate servers? Region lock some of the continents? Also also. E sports. Your game IS NOT READY. not AT ALL. Fix all of the issues above and MAYBE just MAYBE you guys got a shot. Oh and don t even get me started on the console performance issues. My GTA vice city runs better on a toaster then Pubg running on a xbox console. Bottom line is People will copy PUBG. Why? Cause it s a nice formula. Stop with the sillynes of the damn lawsuit against Epic Games Fortnite. They found a way to give back to the community what they really wanted is free to play and is waaay more optimised than your stupid 30 dollar game. We live in a world where things are emulated copied and made better. If not so we wouldn t be talking on high end pc s which are product of a free and competitive market. Things get mirrored so they can be made even better. Its a classic competition module. Get better adapt and evolve your game. Or it WILL PERISH among the many other bad and good copies of the same genre. GOOD LUCK BLUE . Cause I am def leaving this unoptimized piece of garbage game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-01-20,0,0,157,False,Recommended,Despite what people are saying this is a really fun and exciting game. The rumours of terrible lag are simply not true stay on your dedicated server (Mine's EU) and you should be fine. Yes the Chinese are in every server but they don't teamkill you if you aren't Chinese (which is a truth according to a review I have recently read) and some speak English. If you don't fancy playing with Chinese people then play with friends in squads or duos if you don't have any friends then what are you doing with your life? But PUBG has a mode for you! That's right for the low low price of having no friends or simply no friends online there's solo. If you want to play in third person then you simply click the TPP box on the play menu but if you want to play in first person only then you can simply highlight the FPP box and you're good to go. The adrenaline of being in an intense firefight in Los Leones beats any other sensation and the pride of winning or even reaching top ten is immense. There is one issue I have with the game though in the most recent update the developers have added crates which can be only opened with keys which you guessed it can only be recieved with real money these are a bit annoying but if you don't want to spend money you can just not open them (like I have). Overall PUBG is one of my favourite games and I would recommend it to anyone who was thinking about buying it. If you are on the fence about buying this game I would tell you wholeheartedly buy it you won't regret it.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-02-20,0,0,301,False,Not Recommended,Pros Gameplay is awesome(when it works as intended)Cons Endless bugsLots of cheatersUseless devs that focus on more content rather than working content.What you have here is a game that is based on a great idea the gameplay could be amazing but it is overshadowed by terribly programming endless bugs little to no QOL updates and endless amount of hackers. When it runs smoothly and you're not the victim of some idiotic bug playing is a truly cool experience. When you fall through the floor and die get tossed of a building for no reason and die hit an invisible wall while driving a vehicle and die.. Not so much. The current state of the game is what I would expect from a game in early alpha not a fully developed game. The fact that the devs chose to focus on releasing guns maps and new clothing instead of fixing their ing game just goes to show how moronic they are. No wonder their numbers are dropping.If this was developed by people who knew what the they were doing it would be awesome. Sadly this is not the case.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-02-26,0,0,295,False,Not Recommended,I played this game long enough to not recommend PUBG.Here a few reasons poor Netcode &gt 2 Hz Server drops Massives lags heavy D syncsOntherwise Bluehole also added nice new cosmetics. But those new crates have to be opened with a key you have to puchase like those in CS GO. The old stuff is free to open of course. I will never ever tell again anyone about PUBG in a positive way. Bluehole had enough time and a lots of $$$ to fix those technical problems. But they don't and added MICROTRANSACTIONS instead.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2018-03-01,0,0,311,False,Not Recommended,Less emphasis on crates and more on gameplay next time yeh? Also the fact that the zone takes 5 seconds to kill you and you dont even have time to res a teamate whos 3 meters out of the second last zone is just stupid. You should think more about adding a gradual damage increase to the zone as it shrinks rather than a sudden burst of more than triple the damage and speed the moment a zone reaches a certain size.In the late stages of the game the zone timer is also too short to support the damage it puts out. If you happen to have a bad zone spawn and don t literally start running the moment the zone changes it will catch and kill you. Which is ridiculous because in the later stages there are so many enemies crammed together that being forced to rush to the zone so quick is practically an instant death anyway.A couple other things that are long over due are 1. The ability to toggle which maps you want to play. As much as you think everyone likes your new map it s not true.2. A local training map. By this I mean being able to launch a single player match locally that consist of nothing but a shooting range with every gun available and infinite ammo as well as a few targets at varying distances.Currently it s not impossible but it s pretty difficult and annoying to enter a game find a gun shoot a wall and waste all your bullets while trying to adjust your mouse settings to be optimal for controlling bullet spray. A target range type map with all the guns would be perfect. Anyway as it is I do still play the game but it feels like the things that are important for the game to thrive are being neglected so as such I can t recommend it currently.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The matchmaking is terrible and there are still so many bugs with the game that theres too many to count. With the fix pubg campaign i thought to myself ""finally this games big problems are getting addressed and we'll start to see some progress"". Boy was I wrong there hads never been more problems with this game than there are currently and its due to a lack of attention from the entire dev team. I understand that thereare multiple teams working on bugs and skins but for the love of god if your game has this many problems could you at least hold off on the skins for a month at least and get the bugs worked out as fast as possible. This game looked promising and I was really enjoying it but the last few months I just feel like the dev team has been dragging us through the mud and trying to take advantage of us.

2018-06-04,0,0,198,False,Recommended,Overrated? Definitely! Still a fun game for what it is. A gritty gunz a blazing battle royale game. Gun play feels great in close mid range encounters. Long range is another story as it starts to feel like throwing darts at ants due to the bullet drop and the good chance you won't find a decent scope for that rifle you're holding RNG is a huge factor in this game. Armor is also hilariously overpowered in this game. A level 3 vest and helm turns you into a proper bullet sponge. As a $30 title this is still a decent game to pick up. Granted there will be many frustrating loses and near wins. Chicken dinners taste so yummy.7/10 Basic. Worth $30 and not a penny more. Get it on sale if you can.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The engine is licensed the assets are purchased and they really havn't made any of their own contributions to the game. The content drip is slow and when a new update does come out it simply adds more cosmetics to spend money on rather than adding new features or fixing past bugs. The game has been out for a while now and parachute physics STILL do not work.As of late with the loss of players in influx of negative reviews Bluehold has taken to sue Epic games over Fortnite. They lost the popularity contest and are handling it in the most petty way possible. I can't say I havn't had fun with the game but I don't think its gonna get better.

2017-10-29,0,0,431,False,Not Recommended,after spending what i consider a decent amount of time on the game I've come to the conclusion that this game isn't worth a single hour of anyones play time. The servers are absolutely trash they always have been from day one to the date of this review. Instead of spending the money to fix the major flaw thats holding this game back they've decided to go the route of spamming out garbage gameplay changes that have no impact on the game besides creating more lag. this including red zones fog maps and rain maps the developer shows no signs of changing this and every time they promise to fix the server issues just when people start complaining about it the most they drop a new patch that contains nothing that fixes the problems that need to be fixed instead they just throw more re skinned guns with slightly different stats or another vehicle and is soon about to be vaulting and after that a new map. The new servers will never come because the developers aren't willing to shell out the money to fix the issues otherwise the issues would have been fixed a long time ago. Additionally the black screen of death where you cant load into the game or close it makes the game unplayable,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2018-01-30,0,0,76,False,Not Recommended,A fun game but with a few key issues. Primarily server lag.The server update rate is abyssmally unstable and low Around 20Hz dipping lower (8 10Hz) frequently. Meaning effective response times are often &gt 250ms. Rubber banding is an issue. Another major problem is the influx of high ping Chinese players onto EU &amp NA servers so be prepared to play a second in the past. Ping gating isn't hard devs.I feel that PUBG could be made far fairer and a better FPS experience quite easily. I will change my rating if Bluehole address at least some of the concerns above.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

These are just some of the problems I have encountered regular crashes into invisible walls crevases that you cannot climb out of or actually see because the rocks on some parts of the mountain are just visuals that you can fall through the unfinished loot and area spawn that means should you drop in a large city there is a very high chance that your buildings will contain nothing but pistols and weapon attachments and my personal favourite driving in a straight line on a road at 60mph and front flipping into space killing both me and my partner because the almighty dev team thinks that the game is ESPORTS READY.

2018-03-14,0,0,293,False,Not Recommended,I love this and also really hate this game. It basically boils down to a few things.Gameplay is quick intense visceral in many cases. Very addictive and easy to go round after round with a few friends it's a blast. However if I had to describe the current state of pubg it would be. Great concept fun gameplay when it works but awful devs truly awful devs. Cheating is fine (as long as you are happy to buy multiple copies of the game).The cheating situation is out of control. People seem to accept that using (no recoil) mouse macros is a minimum requirement for this game and their use is rampant along with other cheats. Last straw for me is a prolific streamer (not mentioning names) who if you removed the name and it was deathcam footage you would no doubt say they were cheating yet seems to be accepted as ok. I don't watch streamers really but if they are blatantly cheating out in the open and that's fine I don't want to play a game where the community and devs are apologetic towards cheaters.Add to that horrible optimisation patch after patch that breaks things over and over. A complicit attitude towards or ineptitude to deal with the cheating situation this game will be dead within months unless something is done rather quickly.I hope they sort it out because as I said I do love this game I just want to play it without the rampart cheating. At this point I cannot reccomend this game to anyone looking to buy it. The cheating and horrible optimisation really do outweigh an otherwise amazing game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

And its nice to have a game only on pc for awhile to rub it in the face of all the console only friends i have. I have not managed to make it down to the top 10 in a match yet but im not very good either Its nice to play a multiplayer shooter that i dont die in the first 6 seconds. I also like the fact that you have to work and search for weapons and it starts over every match so it keeps things relatively even. In my opinion the game is worth the money and i reccomended to friends lucky enough to have a decent gaming PC. Game also isnt so graphic intense the you need a 2000$ rig to play it and not playing with ultra settings actually seems to be a small benifit ive noticed its easier to spot enemies without the effects on ultra a moving player stands out more thats my experience anyways not saying it will be the same for all,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

There are so many issues with this game from hackers to game glitching all over the place and randomly just canceling the game mid game.

2018-04-25,0,0,134,False,Not Recommended,I have played this game for a reasonable amount of time. At first it was fun but as the cheating got worse and worse it started to make me dislike it more and more. I know they have tried very hard to fix that problem but it is still very frequent in this game. I can put up with the glitching (which has improved alot) but the constant cheating in every other game I am in gets irritating. Do not waste your 30 bucks and if you want a fun game that is battle royal style with a spin on it just get fortnite. Its free and yes there is cheaters there too but to be honest I havent noticed it nearly as much as on here. So I would rather play with cheaters on a game that is free and not nearly as glitchy then on a game I pay for. It does not seem that that they can keep a handle on the hackers on this game. Maybe just a simple update that notifies you if a cheater you have reported has been banned or even better a video clip of them getting the ban would be amazing. but something to show your players that you are doing something about them. Other then YOU telling us you did and we are still seeing them all in there. Until then peace out PUBG,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-02-23,0,0,507,False,Not Recommended,"PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLAGROUNDS is a battle royale game based on the Japanese film Battle Royale.If you haven't already heard of this game chances are you've been living under some kind of rock or these games just don't interest you. PUBG has a lot going for it and it's a great game. However it is a game with MANY flaws and although some games have flaws that can be simply ignored or overlooked PUBG is a game that REQUIRES good execution and minimal flaws to actually enjoy it for a prolonged time. Gameplay is the BIGGEST reason why I've come to despise this game and stopped playing.When I first played this game the whole idea of battle royale and its gameplay drew me in immediately. This game was amazing when I was learning to play and especially with friends it was one of my ""go to"" games for a long time. This game has been through so many changes for the good of the community but it refuses to address core issues that make the game unfun.Rubberbanding was a massive issue and even today it can still be an issue for many players. The amount of lag that occurs in this game is beyond ridiculous and the server's low tick rate makes everything feel unresponsive. Combat in this game is one of the worse in any shooter I've played as movement is very clunky. The use of melee weapons is horrid due to this clunkyness of interacting with other models and environments. There are so many times when I've unloaded my clip onto an enemy and lost the trade only to realize in the death cam that I've only hit him once or twice when I clearly hit them for over that. There are so many times when I've taken fall damage from glitches or incorrect physics. At first I found these little things to be funny and shrugged them off. But these little things all add up to become a big problem and it is very difficult to actually enjoy the game once you've experienced them so many times and they consistently happen.Of course it doesn't mean everything about the gameplay in PUBG sucks complete The shooting in this game is great if not amazing. Although there are times when you feel like some weapons are clearly outclassed by others and bullets seem to disappear when you've aimed perfectly. But thats all PUBG has going for it in terms of gameplay.The concept of Battle Royale can be a major turn off for many people. Essentially over half of this game is about dropping in a location and running around looking for loot. For many people that can be boring and hence people will drop to populated areas for an early game fight. PUBG is a game that revolves around RNG and being at the right place at the right time. In my opinion very little skill is involved in a game like PUBG and the skills that are involved retain mostly only to aiming. The worse thing that can probably happen to you (and it will happen frequently) is looting for 10+ minutes and to die immediately in your first encounter with an enemy. Nothing in this game is ever fair and that's how this game is designed to work. So if you're looking for a game that is fair and balanced PUBG is not your game.Now to other issues outside of gameplay...Sound in this game is TERRIBLE and very misleading. Throughout all my hours of playing I've had many troubles with locating an enemy via sound if I was being shot at medium range. Many times I would be shot and my enemy would not be where I heard the shot. I would be shot from the front but it would sound like I was being shot from my back and as a result I would turn around confused and die. Explosions in this game can really destroy your ears because they are too loud and often when an explosion or grenade explodes near me loud screeching occurs from the noises seemingly breaking the game.The graphics in this game is terribly optimized. I run a 1060 6gb and i5 6500 with 16gb of RAM. With this set up I can hardly run a consistent 60 70 fps without my PC wanting to blow up and causing the game to crash every now and then. The graphics look terrible and makes the game unpleasing to my eyes. Of course graphics isn't too much of an issue for me because it's overall the gameplay that makes me turn away. This is just purely just added salt on the wound.If you do decide to play this game I'd really recommend you play it with friends to take away from all the stress that can build up from this game's incompetence to work properly. This game can be fun when lag is nonexistent and the servers allow for a more smooth experience. But as it is I don't feel that this game will anytime soon be at a level that satisfies me.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

That being said the game in its current state is RIDDLED with Hackers. Not few and Far between. With the implementation of Kill Cams me and my team got a real good look at just how many people were hacking and out of 10 games in a row 9 of them we were killed by obvious hacks. When i say ""obvious"" i mean watching us run inside a building without a clear line of sight. Aim snapping to our heads instantly and unnaturally Bullets hitting nothing but our head without clear line of sight while at full auto. 3rd person spray over a hill hitting only a single spot on the other side where our heads are until mounting the hill and killing us.This game is completely riddled with hackers. And as of now in its current state you are better off playing something that has better anti cheat. If you type the letters ""pubg"" into a google search the first thing that will pop up is ""pubg hackers everywhere"" and that is NOT right. And with the developers focus on micro trans for cosmetics these hackers are being ignored because they simply buy another copy of the game when banned on one account. This is a repeating process the devs do not care to interrupt. Summarized HACKERS EVERYWHERE. DEVS CARE MORE FOR MICRO TRANS. FUN WHEN THERE AINT HACKERS.

2018-04-11,0,0,549,False,Recommended,My first team review....pliss be gentle.First off this game is great just because of the Battle Royale formula and its high relative realism. And for its price its definitely worth it IF and ONLY IF you have a decent PC. I mean this game's optimization is terrible and even though it has improved since the past year it still should not be acceptable. And for some stupid reason they have removed the rain and fog map which was one of the best things about the game. Not its same old 2 maps which get boring after one long sitting.Gameplay is fun and always different depending on how you approach the game and on your personal way of thinking. If you look at any YouTuber or Stream you'll notice how everyone's gameplay is a bit unique in their own way. This game can be played for 1000 hrs and could still be fun.

2018-12-23,0,0,44,False,Recommended,Battle Royale winners are decided a great part by blind luck with skills such reaction time positioning or accuracy being a small part. In PvP free for all gamemodes in games like CoD or Battlefield no matter how good the best player is he is still going to die a time or two to anyone else and with that in mind consider a free for all mode with 100 players on a gigantic map. You can't possibly plan or predict anything except to camp until the safe zone forces you out into the danger again. If you have fun knowing that you most likely will not win from the get go good for you I envy that you can find fun where I simply cannot.That said if not for the inconsistent shot registration and relaticely unsatisfying shot hit animations this game would have the best third person gunplay yet with fantastic sound design (mostly for the weapons).,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-19,0,0,396,True,Recommended,"PUBG is a Battle Royale game. If you don't what BR is it's a game where several people enter an arena (in PUBG's case an 8x8km island) and the game does not end until only one player/team is left standing. The area of play will slowly close in as time goes on and anyone outside of that area will gradually take damage until they enter the area or die forcing confrontation between players. You can play solo duo or as squads of 3 4. This game was my first foray into the BR genre of games. I was aware of games like H1Z1 KOTK but had heard bad things about design choices as well as the developer's attitudes towards their game and it's playerbase. I was initially going to pass on this one as well but after seeing all the huge sale numbers as well as some of my favourite youtubers and friends playing and enjoying the game I thought I'd give it a go.This game definitely is not for everybody. It's slow tense and requires skill but has just enough luck factored in to always keep even the highest level players on their toes. You have your standard weapon types in PUBG. Assault Rifles Shotguns SMGs Sniper Rifles DMRs Pistols and melee weapons (the latter two practically becoming useless once you've attained any of the other weapons). These weapons are surprisingly well balanced for a game in EA. For example the high rate of fire on SMGs make them devastating in close quarters engagements but their poor accuracy give them a limited effective range. Conversely the Sniper Rifles high damage output and travel speed make them a great choice for long range attacks but their bolt action nature make them a very poor choice for an up close fight as they will not down in one hit unless the enemy is already low or you manage to land a faceshot (or headshot in the absence of any kind of headgear). No weapon type feels overpowered and while pistols do feel quite underpowered they are very common finds and are meant to be a 'last resort' type of weapon. You can also find throwables in the forms of frags smokes flashbangs and molotovs.A good portion of your time will be spent searching and looting for these aforementioned weapons as well as healing items boosters and attacthments for these weapons. Attachments come in the form of sights including Red Dot and Holographic sights on top of magnified scopes (ranging from 2x 4x 8x and the incredibly rare 15x) extended and quickdraw mags foregrips and flash hiders/suppressors. These rare items can be the difference between winning or losing an engagement at times which makes the high risk/high reward option of dropping into a high drop area along with several others all the more alluring. As you can imagine the looting is the downtime. You can take a breather observe the current situation and plan your next move. Make no mistake however you are never safe. At any moment another player or group could come rolling up to the area you're in and start looting themselves. You can choose to abandon ship and run away with your life leaving any remianing gear in their clutches. Or you can stand your ground fight the enemy.And when fights do break out in this game they're adrenaline filled tactical and never boring. You have to think about every move carefully as it could very well be your last if you aren't careful. Choosing to peek use a nade run for a vehicle flank. Whether to be aggressive and charge the enemy or be defensive and hope they walk through the door your shotgun is already aimed at. As much as some people will cry out bad luck in their deaths (and yes sometimes you will die to something you didn't see coming) you have more control than you think. Learn from each death and you will slowly but surely become a better player over time. The tactical nature of these fights is only amplified in duo and squad games where coordination callouts and tactics are vital to success. One time I was slowly crawling around the side of a fight while my friends distracted the enemy with gunfire. It kept me on edge knowing that I was screwed if I was spotted but once I got around the side and took them down before they even realized they had been flanked felt amazing as out thinking and outplaying your enemy in this game always does. Even if you lose a fight you probably had a hell of time duking it out. Those fights are what keep me coming back to PUBG over and over and over again to chase that elusive victory and sweet sweet taste of a chicken dinner. And when you do win it feels downright ic.Of course being an Early Access game PUBG is not without it's bugs. And some of them can be infuritating at times. I've had several games where I've been the first to land in a highly populated area only for the buildings to not have properly rendered yet for me making them un enterable causing me to wait and hide for them to render while the rest of the lobby takes the spoils and gears up leaving me with the pathetic leftovers (that is if some guy in full Lvl. 3 in the building I was going to enter that should have been mine doesn't blow my face off beforehand). I've joined squad lobbies with friends only for my game to not load in causing me to end the task and restart again. Optimization is also poor as well. You'll want a decent machine if you're wanting to play this game at 60+ fps. The game is coinstantly getting optimization and bug fixes as time goes on so the devs certainly aren't negelcting these issues. But good will does not make these problems less apparent and dying because of a bug you had no control over can completely kill your desire to play for the rest of the day.All in all if this game sounds interesting to you (particularly if you're a fan of tactical shooters and military sims) and you're willing to trudge through issues and bugs like the ones mentioned above this is a truly great PvP experience that you'll get hours upon hours of fun out of. But it definitely wouldn't hurt to wait for the full release (which the devs have promised on multiple occasions will be before the end of 2017) where it's multitude of bugs and optimization issues should be fixed.UPDATE Thought I'd add a bit to this in light of some of the recent... ""incidents"" surrounding this game.I love PUBG. I truly do. It's one of my favourite games of the year so far. But Bluehole man... you can't keep messing up like this. The whole stream sniping incident happened. That had me a little concerned but I saw both sides of the argument and honestly it didn't bother me that much so I happily moved on from it. Then the Gamescom crate stuff happened and this is when I started taking notice. You claimed you would not add any paid crates or DLC to the game until it was out of Early Access but you did anyway. You claimed this was to help fund the upcoming Gamescom tournament which I would have been fine with... had you not already sold millions of copies of your game. Now I'm not claiming to know everything about games sales and how much money you could realistically give to the invitational but was it really so bad that you felt you should break one of your promises to the community? Once you lose a player or whole community's trust then it is very hard to get back. And now apparently you have straight up lied to the community's face about having servers in China and then having said Chinese players be given in game ads for a game they paid for. Again I love this game. But Bluehole are showing time and time again that they could be more concerned about profit than the actual state of their game. I can't say this as fact of course but it's hard for that thought not to cross your mind when all the incidents listed above were in some way giving them a monetary benefit. If you still want to buy the game then go ahead it's great fun. But right now it's up in the air whether Bluehole's heart is really in the right place with PUBG.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-11-08,0,0,311,False,Not Recommended,In its current state I cannot recommend this game for any person. There are too many game breaking glitches that could ruin your experience. As of late there has been a MASSIVE influx of Chinese hackers on the NA servers. I have never reported anyone for hacking in this game until about 3 weeks ago and since then I have reported about 7 people for hacking. The devs are reliable in their banning from the reports they get but something needs to be done to prevent people from hacking in the first place. Apperantly BattleEye just isn't enough to stop these hackers and the PUBG Corporation needs to come up with something fast to change everyone's minds about their competance in working on this game.EDIT As of February 1st 2018 I still cannot recommend this game. The fact the the creator of the game Brendan Greene thinks that his own player base is being hateful prejudiced and xenophobic toward the Chinese players instead of thinking about the logical reasons for region locking China and frankly everyone sickens me. He thinks that we think that every Chinese player is a hacker and a scourge to the NA servers. This is not true. While I cannot speak for everyone I think the largest factor is not being able to communicate with your teammate because they don't speak English well or at all. A game that relies heavily on teamwork is stopped short by the language barrier and we cry out for help and what does the creator do? Blame us for being xenophobic. An absolutely disgusting display of idiocy from the creator of the game himself. He'll never see this but I hope he does just so he can see how wrong he is about the NA player base. Might as well remove the AS servers and save a little bit of money eh Brendan? Disgusting.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

But their focus on greed allowed Epic to come in with Fornite and steal their thunder. Honestly I am glad Epic did it has forced them to actually start making their game better. Lit a fire under their assess. As of right now I would not recommend this game. It needs to improve a lot more and it has a long way to go.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I like the game I don't blame the publishers (unless the rng bullets are found to be a real thing and it's not my imagination that one account has several gigs of recording showing what i'm talking about) but I do definitely blame the player base here.

2017-09-19,1,1,134,False,Recommended,Playerunknown's Battlegrounds short as PUBG is a FPS battleroyale game. The goal in this game is to be the last one alive. You can play this game with 2 3 friends in a squad match with 1 friend in duos or just alone in solo match. First you drop in from an airplane that goes different routes over the map every time you jump in a match the plane's course will be different. Then you can jump off the plane to an nearby location and loot up. The game offers a large amount of weapons to find on the map or find from the lootdrops that a plane drops occosially during the match. You can find different rifles shotguns pistols sniper rifles and SMGs. And you can find crossbows too but you know... (nobody uses it because its bad). In the lootcrates that the plane drops you can find some high tier weapons such as lightmachine gun other really good automatic rifles and some really good sniper rifles. You can also find weapon attachments around the map (you usually can find loot in houses and large citys' or towns). Some of the attachments you can find are suppressors for different gun types grips other muscle attachments stocks different sights such as a 2 4 8 or 15 times scopes and larger clips or clips that can be reloaded faster. You can also find 3 different helmets kevlars and backpacks to fit all your ammo in. And you also can find medkits larger medkits painkillers energydrinks? and a medical syringe. There are also cars and motorbikes around the map (Usually near houses and roads).You can also drive a boat and a water scooter. After you've geared up the next phace in the game is to move to an safe zone market as a big white circle in the map. You have to get inside the safe zone before you get inside the blue circle or also known as electric wall that will do more damage as the game progresses. The circle will shrink and change location so be aware of that. After every match no matter did you win or lose you will recieve battlepoints as a reward how good you did during that match. Battlepoints are calculated from your damage and what you placed during that game. (Example If you placed 87th you won't be getting too many battlepoints compared to if you placed 1st).There are also two maps you can play on one is a forest themed map and the other one is a desert themed map also there is third one in the making! (Its going to be a jungle themed map)Now for the goods and bads of this game + for good and for bad.+Really fun to play with friends+Really good gun gameplay+Vaulting is really useful and fun+Realy good map desings for both maps+Good bullet physics+Not too complicated controls+Many weapons and attachments to chooce from+Really good graphics (I mean this doesn't really matter for most of the people but I decided to put it in anyways)+Overall good gameplay Broken car physics Many hackers (I haven't countered as much as some people have) Heavy input lag Bad sound design (Sometimes you hear a shot from left and instantly after that you get killed by the same guy you thought shot you from the left from behind of you.)

I have had issues from texture pop in and severe server lag to being punched out of the map and taking fall damage from my own parachute. Scavenging for weapons armor and medical supplies is fun and adds urgency to an already urgent game. This game is great alone but is even better with friends. The game is still in early access though so you are bound to have an issue with it eventually.

2017-12-05,0,0,119,True,Not Recommended,"This game should be the game of the year. This game is probably my favorite game of all time in theory. When you can look past the horrendous optimization bugs server issues rubberbanding and crashes it is one of the best games of all time. However this has been going on for far too long to be tolerable. The game has been in Early Access for about a year now and the game is still a train wreck. Bluehole seems to be proritizing adding new content in and releasing PUBG on other platforms but seem to have totally neglected making the game work in the first place. Yes it only has one map currently and only a handful of guns so new content is appreciated. BUT I know that I along with most people playing would put up with delaying new content for a game that works. Unfortunatly Bluehole seems to be focused on dumping in content so they can ""release"" the game and charge more for the full version and on releasing it on Xbox all to make more money. And now apparently they are working on a Mobile Version? Give me a break. The game is a victim of its own success. The game has made millions and now Bluehole is looking to make every last dollar they can as fast as they can before the game fades into irrelevance because it is broken and too buggy to play.Bluehole PLEASE. This is my favorite game ever. I WANT to sink hundreds of more hours into it but I just cannot deal with the state of this game. Optimize it. Fix the bugs. Fix the DeSync and server issues.

No sorting through servers No stupid long waiting time NO PITCH BLACK NIGHTS.So the match starts and you skydive onto a small continent thing in the ocean.You have to play until you die no respawns in a match. You can't log out mid match Matches usually last less than 35 mins depending on how long you live.Go find a gun QUICK or a car get some body armor and a helmet and extra ammo.now move towards the waypoint on your map to stay in the playable zone which will continue to shrink untill its really small it doesn't just collapse on the center of the circle though it moves around a bit so it can move and then you are forced to give up your hiding spot and move out into the open last person alive wins the match good luck.it's fun every game is different.there's only one map right now but the loot isnt always the same.

If you have the minimum specs I'd say do not play as you'll get under 30 FPS. However my main issue is not the desync or the FPS those can be dealt with since it is Early Access and it is expected.This review is a 0/10 because of cheaters. For the past 2 3 weeks the vast majority of games have consisted of cheaters killing half the server or the entire server. FPS issues and desync can be played around and predicted. However you can't predict or play around getting killed instantlyfrom 2 kilometers away.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2018-02-15,0,0,901,False,Not Recommended,Mixed feelings. The game concept is simple and brilliant. But the game has big issues that are ruining the game.Netcode is one issue which has gotten much better during the last couple of months though it still has a ways to go.The most severe problem is cheaters. In the last month I cannot count on my hand how many times I have been shot by a player with a Chinese sounding alias who have used some kind of hack which allows them to shoot players kilometers away seemingly without even aiming in the right direction.The developers often makes public statements about so and so many cheaters banned in the last months but their efforts are obviously not enough since the cheaters are rampant and to me the problem seems to get only worse. The developers say they have developed new and smart techniques to identify cheaters and they are probably spending lots of time and money to fight the cheaters. They are trying and failing to find a very complicated solution to what many fans believe is a problem with a simple and instant solution Region lock the servers from which the cheating problem mainly emanates i.e. China. This might sound unfair to all those legit Chinese players that are out there. But consider this A game like this needs quick responses and fast reflexes. High ping messes with the response times when players from different continents meet. Usually you do best if you play in that same region that you are living. All those legit Chinese players are probably playing on Chinese servers I mean why wouldn t they. So I don t believe a region lock would limit the game in any meaningful way but only bring positive consequences such as lower ping and blocking the cheaters from further ruining the game experience.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-04-27,1,1,687,True,Recommended,By far the most fun I have ever had since switching to PC gaming.I tried H1Z1 and this sweeps it to the side. The thrill of playing this game from landing and scrambling to get loot before someone else in your vicinity to trying to gain circle control in the later stages this game has it all. The gun balancing is also amazing and being able to add or remove attachments on the fly is also a welcomed bonus.Do not hesitate to buy this game as it is constantly being updated and fixed.AMAZEBALLS!!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-03-23,0,0,137,True,Recommended,I love BR games but havent found one that felt solid or seemed like it was was going in the right direction. Then I get Alpha/beta access to this beautiful game. Even though it has some problematic bugs (sound issues minor lag ect) this game has plenty to offer. I am surprised I did so well in alpha and beta since I was so rusty (Low 100s for solo) and absolutely love the amount of loot there is and attachments guns armor wheres waldo long sleeve and the twitch streamer sprays that happened for the Alpha/Beta was pretty fun as well. Craziest bug for me is the inability to hear behind you as many a player has snuck up from behind since it wont pick up doors and footsteps so I just stayed extra vigilant and I expect the bugs that are in the game to be fixed rather quickly.So far with its current issues its a solid 8/10 and this will get higher as I imagine the bugs will be fixed since the game feels really balanced already and the decent amount of content with weapons/attachments and other gear/clothing as I do imagine there will be much more added after proper priorities are met.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-04-25,0,0,257,True,Recommended,I honestly did not expect to like this game I only purchased it to play with my friends. Turns out that I love it. I have played H1Z1 a bit in the past on my buddy's computer and never liked it. PUBG feels more tactical and less arcady then H1Z1 but not so overbearingly tactical like ARMA. The true reason that I can 100% support this game is the dev team. I have NEVER seen a dev team put in so much work so quickly in an early access game. The game is buggy and it isn't remotely close to being optimized (YET) but the devs are making it slightly better almost every day. I have became very jaded and sceptical in regards to Early Access games but this dev team has impressed me enough to purchase and invest a lot of time into a fun but currently buggy/unfinished game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-09-25,0,0,223,True,Recommended,For those who don't know PUBG is a game where you drop into a giant map with 100 other people and fight to be the last one standing. There's solo duo and squads which can consist of 4 people. The best game to compare it to is Arma or Dayz. There's a lot of looting realistic(ish) encounters and combat. But here's a little explination oh why it get's lower reviews. Does the game run badly? It can yeah. It's not fully optomized. You'll want to set your Graphics settings to low except for view distance and textures. I have an i5/8gb ram/radeon 480. I was able to play but it could get very laggy on me. I replaced my drive with an SSD no more problems so I highly recommend an SSD. Is the game worth $30? Absolutly. Not many video game developers would market a world wide success for $30 less than the average tripple A title. Is the game being constantly worked on? Yes since it's release new weapons and weather types on the maps have been introduced. Still waiting on a new western themed map as well. If you're someone who's used to overwatch or COD you might not have a great time. It's a diffucult game and out of 100 people someone's gonna smack you down almost every game. If you decide to buy it with no prior knowledge of the game then you need to be prepaired for the learning curve. Other than that it's a fun and immersive experience especially if you have other people to play with.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-11-21,0,0,653,False,Recommended,"Well this is a tough question to ask.Depending on how much experience you have with the Battle Royale game modes and how much you enjoy getting penetrated from behind this game will either be fun or not.Purchasing this game back in Beta this was well worth my $30usd i paid back then. I have enjoyed this game for hours upon end with friends and with strangers. If you are just getting into the game I suggest you do some research into the game first. Having not played for a few months this game seems to have broken OC FP servers meaning that those who want an even playingfield are discouraged from playing this game and instead moved to different games. Not too long ago I remember my entire friends list filled with friends playing this game. Maybe the phase is over or the game is too broken to play however in its current state no one is really jumping into pubg. If you still have friends who play this game and have no issues with servers go right ahead and purchase the game to play with them. If not go spend your money on other games.TLDR You will die in BS ways a lot. You will be playing running simulator a lot. You will have a lot of trouble competing against seasoned veterans when you first begin and hence die a lot. You will be constantly saying ""why do I even play this broken game"" a lot. You may play with friends which is actually pretty fun.Fun game lots of rage involved idk what they did to break OC servers.PS bring back broken beta car physics pls",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-11-23,0,0,152,False,Recommended,"Quick ThoughtThis is the first Battle Royale game that really makes me addictively to it. I know it's basically a rip off to other games. But some how when i watched the gameplay of the others Battle Royale game it doesn't makes me really wanna play it. But when i saw this one i tried to find what the title is. So i found it yay!Graphic etc.Graphics and Visuals are really great on this game. Unreal Engine is pretty cool and really amazing makes impress when i first time saw the screenshot of the game. Because the In Game graphic is really great as the screenshot. The graphics rendering are more faster than the early access one. Really no doubting about the graphics.GameplayAfter release 1.0 patch which is full release the game is more optimizely than the early access. Some fps drops bugs glitchs etc. The game is really not optimize when early access. But when full release came. The game is had a better perfomance to play but somehow still has a bugs and glitchs on it. Just a few not to much. For me gameplay is really make me addicted to play it because the running animation are just to damn good. And looting is more fun i don't why tho'. With the Vault Animation makes the game really easier to move. So far the game is still fun to play.MultiplayerYes the game is only online multiplayer. But i just wanna explain the only multiplayer features got in here. Multiplayer servers so far when i'm playing it there's none of problems on the server that PUBG had. I'd just always Disconnected because my Connection lag not from the Server Problem. Multiplayer customise the customise are really great so much shirt pants gloves and now with weapon skins. Which is okay and not a problems but not to have Boxes update that got an Overpowered Weapons and pay more for it. Multiplayer modes has 2 modes so far. Mini Royale and Battle Royale. Maps has 3 now. Which is Erangel Miramar and Sanhok. I don't about the last one because regular Map is 8x8KM but Sanhok has 4x4KM Map so i think that map is only available on Mini Royale mode. Last battleeye for cheater on this game? I don't really know that this game has a lot of cheater or not because i'd just enjoy it the game. When i'm dead that's okay try again until you feel tired and stop playing it. I don't really bother the cheater so much but i do care about get rid of them. Because there's just a few people who like me and i don't know 'bout tryhards? Okay i think that's enough for it so the gameplay is pretty decent to play.OverallAs i said the game is pretty decent to play. But if you worrying that you might not like the game. Buy it when it has a sale on it maybe worth? So yeah the game core is generic as other Battle Royale game but this one got me into the game so much. I don't know about you? Try for sure? Friendly Reminder Steam had a Refund features. So don't worry be happy.Rate 8/10 ""D E C E N T""",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Overall the game always runs smooth for me and I have not experienced any type of glitching or crashing. Some others have experienced lag but I have not thus far. I can only hope to see the game finish and get polished. Here are some things that the game is lacking right now that I think would make the game more immersive. 1. More maps and different weather conditions.( I have heard this is coming soon)2. More game types3.

The game has improved miles and miles but it is still... lagging behind. I love Vikendi but they copy pasted fortnites battlepass (yeah after they tried to sue them for copying the game) except there are no notable rewards in it. Gunplay is actually really good the game is finally half decently optimized hackers arnt anywhere near as bad as it used to be (they are defintly still there though). And yet i am not sure if i can recommend it. I personally hate shooters so the game is only enjoyable to me in a group but every game is fun with friends. If you like realistic shooters with bullet time and bullet drop i highly recommend it.

I find most of the games problems atm are small and don't impact game experience that much. There's hardly a time when i don't enjoy booting up this game.PS. I already love Vikendi after playing only afew hours on it the map has so much character and an abundance of cover (something lacking on mirimar).

2019-01-03,0,0,189,False,Recommended,"Ok so I played this game for quite a while and well... I'm not sure what I am supposed to think of it.The only thing that keeps me playing from time to time is the fun that the game sometimes has.Other than that I would say that it has much more potential than its current state. Some of the things that I really don't like about PUBG Performance and Design The performance is really... bad on most systems without modern standards. I'm running a GTX 970 with sometimes under 30FPS on very low settings. Of course other factors play into these numbers but if you think about it the gpu is two years older than the game which makes such performance unacceptable. Well unacceptable to an extent where a game should at least look stunning to be somewhat acceptable which it doesn't. Of course I have played the game on ultra settings leading to FPS that I don't even want to talk about but PUBG still doesn't look good compared to other modern games. Even in livestreams and YT videos it just doesn't look as good as to justify such a lack in performance. Also this game sometimes consists of nothing but bugs. Gameplay As someone who is used to CSGO gameplay I find the overall movement and everything so tiring and slow. Several factors play into this There is an acceleration from walking to running* of like a second or two which feels so slooooow. Then picking up items and managing inventory can be a nightmare as you have to pull everything in and out (or right click which is very inconsistent) which if you aren't shroud is just tiring and especially really bad when landing in popular spots like school. Overall problems with BR (Only few factors play into this review as BR is what it is)In the end the map size makes players' positions unpredictable. I sometimes loot a seemingly untouched village and get killed by someone hiding in a bathroom. Camping is something that this concept brings with it.//btw I think CSGO did a really good job at this as they give some positional information but don't really make it easy whatsoever.//Then getting good at a BR game can be really frustrating. You either land in a popular spot and are likely to get killed immediately or in a village to unluckily get killed after 10 minutes of looting.Finally when you play in a team dying is so annoying since you sometimes have to watch your teammates play without you for like half an hour //which isn't the case in games CSGO or R6//. For me this is one of the most frustrating things.Those lacks might seem heavy but I would still recommend this game. I recommend it to those who have sufficient hardware want to get away from older non BR games like CSGO like BR are ready to engage long learning and frustration*And please don't tell me that running acceleration is 'realistic'. It is a video game that has a very unrealistic core concept (""BR"") a player zone that doesn't make any sense (unlike H1) and colorizable blood (like wtf). Video games can be based on realistic ideas (such as FPS) but more realism must be done really well (like in R6).",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2019-01-09,0,0,174,False,Not Recommended,This is an early access game for the price of a full game On the off chance the game runs without a bug occurring its fun for a while but the initial feeling of anxiety you get traversing the map alone looking for an enemy gets washed away by the feeling of actually wanting to do something and engage in this game too much of the base gameplay is downtime just running to get some action and once you do get some action it lasts for perhaps 5 min at most before you are once again left to the seemingly empty map if you surivive or back to the title screen if you dont.Now if you consider the ridiculous amount of bugs and technical issues with the game it becomes a nightmare the amount of times either i or my friends have dropped and fallen through a building or hit something and died straight up is too much to count The game still crashes Vaulting and moving around is tedious Frame rate can tank mind you i have a higher end pc and im often getting a significant drop for some of my friends this often can cost them games I live in Australia and this game does not care about our region with horrible servers that have at the lowest ive seen 200 ping playing against people who will often get less than 60 ping which really makes firefights even more enjoyable.And then we come to the horrible way PUBG Corp has decided to monetise this game as if $43AUD/$30USD wasnt enough they put lootcrates into the game with purchaseable keys much like csgo alongside worthless season passes that net the player meaningless cosmetics. I feel as though pubg corp care more about milking its playerbase for money than actually optimising and building the game we were promised years ago.All in all PUBG has become an excellent example of why you should never support the paid early access format as it has lead to an unfinished game being released for full price with only broken promises left in its wake.Dont buy this game use your money to buy a game that will actually work and support developers who care for their fanbase unlike the devs of this game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-11-22,0,0,228,False,Recommended,Alright don't get me wrong this game has alot of issues and can be very tilting. The learning curve is very steep and you will go days without getting a win its just how it goes. What you are working towards is being good enough to consistently get wins. It doesn't matter if it is Solos Duos or Squads. You just have to play alot to get better there is no shortcuts. However at its core the game is a fun game to play with friends. Solo can be fun if you are into that however it just doesn't interest me. I have alot of fun playing Squads with my friends. It is true you can go in with a casual mindset and have fun but you will most likely end up raging. Its fun. It has problems. Every player will enjoy different things. Its a BR and you will lose. The strength of this game comes from how you take the game in stride.I recommend it there is issues but its priced decently for what it offers.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-12-25,1,1,664,False,Not Recommended,If you havent bought PUBG till now dont do it it would be real waste of money.PUBG used to be a good game full of action and fun. Today there still is an action but the fun is slowly but for sure diappearing. There are many reasons why PUBG is becoming really game. Mostly its because of developers endless need of money well actualy they dont need more money they just want them and they dont have any relations with the game so they dont give a about that they are destroying it with in game transactions on which they center their whole work instead of fixing glitches which make game unplayable for a lot of players. Its very frustrating when you die a lot of times because your game is freezing everytime you got shot from a short distance i personaly have experienced this just a few times but a lot of people i know are not able to play becuase of this. What i experience everyday sometimes even 4 times a day is unpredictable game freeze and crash after that im not able to do anything with my computer untill the game is closed completely. Otherwise im playing on highest settings on 60 FPS and FPS drops are happening only at start of the first 3 rounds after i launch the game.

2018-05-24,0,0,784,False,Not Recommended,The potential of PUBG has been shown by its hugh popularity and it can be fantastic to play. But it is compromised by a number of issues which it seems the developers have struggled to fix or perhaps not priortised. The plague of cheaters has reduced of late but now the lack of optimization of the game's performance means that even high performance PCs struggle to eradicate lag and FPS drop. I've tried all manner of fixes though they havent worked but it should be the developers who are working to improve optimisation not YouTubers.

This is an absolutely top notch multiplayer FPS that sits on a pedestal yet to be toppled. If you are a fan of competitive FPS then this is a title that you absolutely should not miss.

2017-12-22,0,0,10,False,Not Recommended,So this is definitely a cool game! It has redefined online shooter genre by making something we are mainly used to see in the movies this can be seen by the share numbers of people playing. But the reason I give this a thumbs down is that in terms of coop which as far as I understood it most people are playing this game doesn t offer that much that hasn t already been done. It s just the solo mode with a team instead. For me coop is essentially the most important part in a online shooter these days and there you have SQUAD which is an excellent game already in open alpha. Then you have HELL LET LOOSE due next year. These games are the future of coop in my opinion if you are searching for a tactical shooter. Giving thumbs down is not to say that PUBG is bad in any way it s just not in my taste.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Constant crashes bullets dont register properly desync all over..... just a piece of trash.Not worth your $$. Does NOT deserve the hype at all! Another Early Access garbage ala DayZ. H1Z1 clone. Racist community. Before the start of every game you have to listen to racial slurs for 60 seconds from some underdeveloped prepubescent mindset idiots and general human garbage. Guns don't reload with the animation causing you to have 0 ammo if you do any action. You have to wait an extra second AFTER the reload animation stops. Terrible optimization of the engine constant frame drops and jitter. Matchmaking is incomplete and it does not work. Smurfs in every game. NO STOP TELLING ME THAT IT WORKS! Every 2nd player is some aim god headshotting you while running across the doorway 300 meters away. No these guys do NOT belong in my game wth! Terrible jumping and movement mechanics straight up infuriating at times. They will never get vaulting to work! It will suck just as much as the current jumping mechanics. It will be another year until they fix that too if ever. Crap building models with barred windows that you can't shoot through or break. Bars Right at your aim level! Why??? What are they doing balancing a CS GO map?!? Crap building models with staircases that you constantly get stuck to if you come at the wrong angle. Network code problems! Lag! You never know what your ping is and you can never tell if your hits register. Sometimes spot on sometimes the other guy keeps taking bullets... from a whole squad and gets away! Takes 5 6 (or 10 rounds depending how the game feels) center mass to kill someone with armour. Another generic kiddy shooter that needs to learn from arma. You shoot a guy 3 times in the back so he can turn around in a millisecond and headshot you while jumping/running. Cause? Frame drops messing with my aiming matchmaking with amazing players chinese lagger hacks terrible mechanics. Terrible spatial sound you can't tell where the enemy is coming from. Shots from the back sound identical to shots from the front. You can survive a 4 story fall with 3/4 of your life. 2 story jump no problem! Devs don't fix the simplest which people have been screaming about since release. For some reason they are focusing on vaulting new map and xBOX. Basically working on adding MORE problems and bugs and digging a bigger hole.Just watch the pros on Twitch you'll have more fun.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The reason i am not recommending is that for a game that takes seems to enjoy being mostly realistic (as much as it can be) the surround sound system is bad beyond belief. I use a Hyperx Cloud Revolver S headset and even that could not pick up a door opening or someone sprinting up to me from behind heavy breathing with a meat cleaver. This point alone for me fails it as in games like this you rely on sound to know if an enemy is nearby.

Wether they ESP No recoil Speed heal Aimbot or Speed run/walk it is EVERYWHERE. They make enough money selling the BP earned items they STOLE from legit playing players before they get banned to rebuy the game and earn profit. So they have no reason to stop. It's infuriating.... honestly. As soon as another game comes out that puts anti cheat on a higher priority I will NEVER touch PUBG again.

Sadly this game is unplayable due to cheaters I played 5 games in a row with a hacker at least in each one. ""we're implementing new anti cheat measure"" all you did is bring more cheaters until now. I do not believe that you banned 1+million players since I start finding more and more cheaters day by day. It's sad good game but ruined by cheaters.UPDATE I have recently played it I tried it on Nvidia NOW and my fps was still going under 60 fps for some reason (I have even set very low to everything and screen scale lower than 100 and still had the problem). Even when I opened the inventory or looking through the 8x scope felt like it was moving with 30 fps max (I've tried many options sensitivity etc). For a game like this to go under 60 fps so frequently is unacceptable on Nvidia now.Updates so far Bad optimization &gt Good Optimization &gt Bad Optimization &gt Microtransactions for life.Bluehole you don't give a c*** about the game anymore. You only care about microtransactions and anything that can give you money. Can't even run custom games without paying you (i know now it's free because of testing). From a game that had potential when I first bought it it turned into one of the games I will never ever touch it because of your poor programming of the game.Update 7 September 2018 I have also tested the game on my laptop ( I run destiny 2 just fine not on high but fine on medium) and I can say the game got a new record of 20 fps for 5 minutes straight.

I amy still play it occaisionally but for now I will never discuss this positively. Over the past 4 weeks the game has gone severely downhill in terms of quality of gameplay cheaters and netcode/server performance. As of today 21 October there are about three to five hackers per game including speedhacks aimbots and godmodes all of which are easily mitigatable by the VAC system. I'm not too sure why this is even happeneing as they supposedly have battleye installed on the servers for this game. Besides the rampant hacking the netcode is awful having repeated stutters on my end and on the other end (confirmed by people I have played with). For a game that has sold as much as it has its pathetic to have performance issues like this. The gameplay itself ahs gone downhill as well as i guess they are focusing on other things besides parachuting falling through walls and floors items being stuck inside of chairs or the floor grass and bushes still not rendering past 150 meters and many many other silly issues that can be easily fixed. If i could refund this game now i would in a heartybeat but since i can't i'll post a bad review and tell all of my friends to get something else maybe that silly EPIC Games ripoff as you get all of the t but for free.EDIT 1 10 days later from original post and things are just as bad. hackers every match mostly Chinese. Still don't buy this game.EDIT 2 (10 Nov 2017) Still no fixes still rampant cheaters. Still don't recommend.EDIT 3 (20 Nov 2017) Same as above.EDIT 4 (1 Dec 2017) Have only had one or two hackers in about 20 matches over the past 11 days. THat really appears to be the only thing that has been sort of resolved. Just also noticed that you can't drop items from your equipped weapons if your inventory is full... not sure how that makes any sense...EDIT 5 (11 Dec 2017) Still a ton of hackers i mean literally every game there is still one or two hackers with most players in an NA server Chinese. They need to figure this out real quick especially seeing as 1.0 is coming in 9 days and there is this much hacking...EDIT 6 (26 Dec 2017) v 1.0 is now out and there are some issues with players not earning BP. No big deal but the fact that it hasnt been fixed in a few days is worrisome. The new map is pretty neat but way too big There is no need for big maps in this game as there is too much walking from the old map. The game is still poorly optimized.EDIT 7 (30 Dec 2017) Not sure wtf they did last night with an update but movement and functioning inside of any building on either map is buggy as . Tons of stuttering and delay in picking things up. Holy cow its bad.EDIT 8 (7 Jan 2018) Killed by another couple of dozen hackers and the FPS inside of buildings is still awful. these devs and Brendan Greene.EDIT 9 (27 Jan 2018) Since there are still a mega ton of issues with this game I have been spending more time with others. Over the past 20 days I have still encounted numerous hackers not tom ention the awful connections/servers and the serious FPS dips.EDIT 10 (4 March 2018) You would think after a month of not playing daily PUBG would have dealt with SOME of the issues from January...

2017-08-26,0,0,90,True,Not Recommended,Im very sad to discover something that is going on with the Devs and how their greed hs blinded to simple truths. This whole screen sniping thing. I dont actually understand how a game where tags are not even available and matches are random how thats even possible unless you are incredibly lucky to get paired with a streamer and know with a hundred percent certainty that its them. Its seems highly unlikely. The fact that people are getting banned from the game due to complaints of popular streamer complaints its out right disgusting and the devs should be ashamed of themselves. I'm a very casual player and just like to get on every once in a while and play with my brother and bought the game because of watching a streamer. I honestly think people who are banned should fill a class action lawsuit against bluehole if they feel they were banned without evidence. To purchase a product for access and to have that taken away from you with no evidence has to be breaking a contract you make with the company upon purchasing the game that as long as you are not activly making hacks for the game or breaking any guidelines that can be proven with evidence and not just based on the words of someone because they didnt like someone honking their horn at them as they got ran over by a vehicle or some dumb like that that I have been reading everywhere. What seemed like a good fun game to just jump into and play with your friends has quickly become tainted . Streamers are ruining the experience for everyone else and the devs should be ashamed for not standing with the community at large as a majority of players aren't streamers. Another thing I find gme breaking that is absolute garbage is what is the point of even having grass? It would seem is all you have to do is turn your graphics down to get rid of grass and all thats left is a persons character sitting out in the open plane as day waiting to be shot. I was shot by a guy 100 yards a way when I was on a hill in tall grass and since I have a high end graphics card I could barely see him. He was at the firing range. At first the game was just a jolly good time. It was buggy hit detection sucked but it was always fun. Now I am afraid to even get on because what if I get paired with a streamer and I run him over and he gets pissy and gets me banned because he is salty he died. Then what? I'm out $30?

2019-01-12,0,0,6,False,Not Recommended,I wish there was a way I could recommend this game but it just feels too broken and if I told someone to buy it I'd feel a sense of guilt.I've only played for a short time but if you play or 6 hours then you know how it's going to feel when you get up to 60 hours. The gameplay loop can vary but usually you're either dropped right into a fireffight where you and 20 other people are scrambling for weapons to kill eachother dropped in a location that has no one around for what feels like 500 meters and you scavenge for weapons to either be OP during the final fight or shot in the head by a sniper or you die as you drop because of a bug hacker or sometimes just a quick player who made it to the ground first and got a weapon too shoot you with as you make your decent. It has some fun momments when you kill another or even win the match there is the sense of accomplishment but then you go to the menu where your reward for the match is spending $2.50 to open a crate that you won in a game that you already paid $30.00 for.Overall it comes down to preference of genres and tolerance of errors.If you like Battle Royale games with a mostly realistic asthetic and can look past the not so small ammount of bugs and hackers this game can be fun for you but try to be observant and remember the terms of Steam's return policy.If you like realistic fps games with significantly les bugs and cheaters and also want to try the battle royale genre I've heard Black Ops 4 did okay with it but I haven't tried myself so feel free to try that and tell me if it's goood or not.If you're like me and prefer games that keep you in the action from spawn to match completion instead of dropping you in a walled garden where sometims you can get 50 kills and others you die before you even get a gun my advice is try something more like TF2 Overwatch Counter Strike or some big FPS like Call of Duty and see which ones you like it's okay to have preferences.If you bought this game and enjoy it that's good I'm glad you can enjoy it when I can't but if you bought it and feel the same as me the best thing to do is leave a review with your feedback see if you can get a refund for the game and try to forget this game even exists.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2018-07-07,0,0,69,False,Not Recommended,"With DLC and microtransactions there are always a disporportionally small percentage of players aka ""whales "" who keep those economies afloat by buying lots of additional content. Publishers depend on this small population of big spenders to keep the game monitized long after they've made thier profits on the initial sale price and frankly there is nothing inherently wrong with that if people have the money and desire to purchase aesthetic upgrades great! But when those are the ONLY improvements/updates that are prioritized for months and months and months....well eventually the vast majority of ""non whale"" gamers start to realize that THEIR needs will never be prioritized and move on. I alreadly paid $30 bucks to play this. I wasn't expecting the perfect game but I was expecting the gameplay quality to improve over time. But I can only get killed walking into a car tire or driving a motorcycle over grass or getting stuck between objects that you can't jump out of so many times before I start to wonder if those things will EVER be fixed.The game and the decisionmaking from the leadership is unsustainable. The business model is unsustainable. I know you have to keep making money to stay afloat. But all you've focused on for months is short term profits at the expense of long term sustainability of the game. You can't keep making short term profits off DLC if the game is dead! I believe the beast is now so large and expensive to operate that there is no solving the issue. They should have focused on tightning up the gameplay a year ago at the peak of popularity so the game could maintain its player base. But instead they focused on flashy money grabs and have lost 50% of their player base between January and June. Now they can only continue to focus on those cheap money grabs because they aren't getting the new players dropping $30 every purchase anymore and they've already lost half the base they were trying to peddle their crap to in the first place. The biggest irony is that they are hemorrhaging players and profits to free to play games like Fortnite who realized early on that gameplay fun and that community driven gameplay improvements have to be the priority to keep gamers engaged. Not to mention Fortnite is INSANELY profitable and yet no one seems to feel patronized by their DLC/microtransactions proving the F2P system can work.Normally I like to keep my reviews shorter but as many have echoed I really wanted to love this game and felt it deserved more analysis. Keep your $30 as it will be better spent on a game that will still exist in a year's time. Personally I'm not much for Fortnite's building mechanics but I see a lot of future promise with another BR game called Realm Royale. Both are free so try them before burning your money here.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-17,0,0,397,False,Not Recommended,I've given this game over 300 hours now so I think I can give an okay review. Player Unknown Battlegrounds is a fun game there is no doubt. I literally play almost every day with friends. However you would think with being literally the most popular game in the world they would invest into their own game. Instead they've optimised very little but like most other game companies added a shop so you can spend MORE money. I don't want to be a broken record becuase we hear the gaming community ing about this constantly... but give us a finished product (or at least something close) then ask for our money again. I've been running into wall glitching/aimbot using hackers more often lately somehow... I thought this should be taken care of. It's really frustating having 10 kills and getting towards the last couple circles only to get shot through a hill randomly while you're behind cover. The last 3 days I've had to repair game files/reinstall PUBG all together becuase there have been issues over and over with my sound. Sometimes it's not there at all and now today I have this unbearable crackling. (windows sound is fine) Another thing listen to your f***ing community. You don't. Again I repeat this game is fun you will have fun. If you're looking to buy this and start playing don't it's addicting and frustrating. Those two together aren't a good combo... mostly dont spend $30 on a beta game that by the looks of it will never be anything more than that and a cash grab.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-11-29,0,0,126,False,Not Recommended,"Currently I don't recommend this game.1) Death Cam/Spectate. Because of how horrible the playback system is you might as well just take a gamble at whether or not youre going to get a remotely accurate image or video of what really happened which completely ruins the point of having a death cam to see what you did wrong or how they got the upper hand.2) Cheaters. There are a huge amount of cheaters and due to how this game works the common forms of cheating (wallhacks and aim assistance) are deadly in how effective they are.3) Miramar. It's a bad map. All of the problems with the low risk areas in Erangel (lack of interaction way too long transit periods lack of cover and how they become pointless in the end game) are basically the only thing that Miramar is. On top of that you do not currently have a choice between what maps you want to play.4) The pathetic 'skin economy'. There's nothing there all of the items are identical. The crates are pointless and mostly have trashy items that don't look appealing. The later crates which have nicer cosmetics in them almost all require keys and the weapon skins that currently exist in the few weapon skin crates look awful they're essentially on par with the weapon skins you can unlock in call of duty equally unappealing equally visually jarring and equally pointless.5) Brendan Greene.6) The movement engine. This game suffers heavily from the same almost universally terrible way that Unreal Engine handles jumping it's floaty uncontrollable and super janky along with how odd the movement is in general. Strafing is essentially non existant with your model only slightly accounting for your actual movements sometimes not at all and the gunplay's ""movement inaccuracy"" (inspired from CSGO) is almost nonexistant and only exists in a way that it's there it doesn't actually affect gameplay and as such does not punish running and gunning in medium quarters and especially not in CQC.On top of these the fact that they're trying to turn this barely open access bugfest into an esport is laughable at best and this game is so horribly unoptimized it's sad. Even with my gaming rig (intel 4790k 16gb ram gtx 980ti) I can't get over 150 fps if you've ever heard of 'frame input lag' or played any competitive game like CS you'll know why this is horrible.

2017-08-12,0,0,846,False,Recommended,All my review before the V1.0 updates are considered moot with the current version of the game it got its optimization thats the game very much needed now the crashes only happens very seldomly but the fps and the performance overall of the game is so much better. I can now up my settings while getting more fps than on very low before the updates. Furthermore now there's new map and some new weapons increasing the variety of the gameplay elements for the game. It is a very much appreciated and congratulated to pubg corp. for bringing this updates up. I hope it can only continue to get better from now onward.As for the cons I'm having with the current updates especially the new map Miramar is that the map is HUGE I know based on the scale is the same as the Erangel(old map) but due to a lot more water area in Erangel it doesn't make it seems as big as the Miramar. With all the new buildings and town/cities in Miramar it makes the map seems a lot bigger than what it seen. All this makes the game in the middle phase of the game are a pretty much a walking sims or vehicles driving sims. Don't forget the server stability issues yes it is still pretty much rubberbanding in the early game and all that will be gone in the mid to late game phases but still it kinda annoying when it happens when you drop down in a crowded populated area where you have to fight in the early game.Despite the above mentioned problems it is still the PUBG we all know and love and hate. I just hope PUBG Corp. keeps bringing the game to the better state than previous whilst also keep the transparency of the development and also keep listening to the feedback of the community rather than busying themself with not so important thing as copycats or so cus in gaming there is no such thing as you can keep the whole genre to yourself you just have to show your game to be the best for that genre to prove it via the developments and contents.That is all all in all the game is a worthy of your spending for the fun it provides.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

It's a battle royale game (similar to H1Z1).Pros Really fun with friends and very intense.Alot of weapons and the game is still being developed and new weapons items and maps are being introduced.Driving is really fun and most of the driving bugs are fixed now.Long range combat is easy to do but hard to master.Close range combat is one of the most intense things I've ever experienced.The game is very balanced rn imo.Only two maps are out right now (Erangel (first map released) and the desert of Miramar (recently released) but still the two maps are very fun and it doesn't feel repetitive imo.The end game battle is very fun and intense and very rewarding.Cons Bad optimization but an improvement can be noticed since the desert of Miramar update. I used to get 30 40 FPS on very low graphics on a 1050Ti with good specs and now I get 60fps. Not great but it's still improving as this game just came out of early access anyways.P.S. Get a good pc because as I just said the optimization is not the best right now but overall it's a masterpiece.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-02-11,0,0,248,False,Recommended,"PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds (PUBG) is a multiplayer online battle royale game developed and published by PUBG Corporation a subsidiary of Korean publisher Bluehole. The game is based on previous mods that were developed by Brendan ""PlayerUnknown"" Greene for other games using the 2000 film Battle Royale for inspiration and expanded into a standalone game under Greene's creative direction. In the game up to one hundred players parachute onto an island and scavenge for weapons and equipment to kill others while avoiding getting killed themselves. The available safe area of the game's map decreases in size over time directing surviving players into tighter areas to force encounters. The last player or team standing wins the round.The game was released for Microsoft Windows via Steam's early access beta program in March 2017 with a full release on December 20 2017. That same month the game was released by Microsoft Studios for the Xbox One via its Xbox Game Preview program. By the end of the year the Steam version had sold over twenty four million copies and held a peak concurrent player count of over three million making it the most played game on the platform while the Xbox One version sold over four million itself a month after release. The game is planned to be localized and released by Tencent in China including two different mobile device versions exclusive to the country.Battlegrounds received several positive reviews from critics during both its early access period and on final release reviewers found that while the game still was not fully finished and had some technical flaws Battlegrounds presented new types of gameplay that could be easily approached by players of any skill level and was highly replayable. The game received several nominations for Game of the Year and other awards for 2017 and is considered the defining game of the battle royale genre. Several other video games following in Battlegrounds's success added battle royale style modes while a number of clones primarily out of China also appeared. PUBG Corporation anticipates Battlegrounds to become an eSport and has run several small tournaments and introduced in game tools to help with broadcasting the game to spectators.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Yea after countless optimization changes and server changes I'd say it has come a long way since its initial release. It just feels like an entriely different game almost. Does it have content? I mean it's a classic BR shooter so it's pretty straightforward. But they have added two new maps multiple game modes and some new weapons which keeps it somewhat fresh. However they didn't execute the ""battle pass"" aspect so well. This feature is ideal (and essentially made) for a F2P model so it needs to be changed up if they want to keep this game at a 30 dollar price tag. For a shooter it has great gunplay and control but like any games in this genre latency can screw you over. But they seem to be more open and adamant to further optimzie the game for an even smoother experience. Overall this game is easy to pick up and play yet has a good learning curve to get better.

I mean you may actually land a punch headshot on a different player than you were aiming for that's how teleport like choppy it can be. Might still feel choppy when using normal punches or melee weapons but a lot less noticeable.

Would love to see this game exist for Mac users. That said the game is slow and fast at the same time.

2017-10-15,0,0,53,True,Recommended,See I usually don't make public reviews for games dont know why i guess i always felt that someone somewhere else could analyse it much better than i could now recently this game's hate has sky rocketed. I understand some of this hate with stream sniping (not that i can play the game well enough to snipe people) but you guys gotta remember this PlayerUnknown (Brendan Greene) was given a shot to show his passion for this kind of game. I believe he did it well and is very modest when it comes to his newfound wealth imo. Im not telling anyone to like it it has its flaws with basically sitting in a house half of the game then the circle moves to an inconvienient location and as you run you probably get shot at and killed (at least thats my experience) but i can't forget the genuinely adrenline pumping moments that can come out of this game. While i feel most of my death are down to having the other person with a machine gun and me stuck to a shotgun or pistol its playing with friends or family that this game really shines. But yes its average review scores do make sense in a technical sense. Because if you're a formal reviewer certain games have certain quotas they need to meet and such. But in a fun sense id recon this game does well in engaging you when necessary. TL DR Imo its a fantastic game that has its short comings and for the people that dislike the game more power to ya. Its fine to dislike something maybe the devs will see the hate for specific elements and fix it (i mean final fantasy 15) did it) just you know guys lets not make this Undertale where it's hard to tell who's worse the haters or the supporters.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-03,0,0,655,False,Not Recommended,I bought this game withing first few weeks of its release. At that time it was a buggy mess . Heck I even refunded it because I was getting around 40 fps with a 980 ti and i7 . There was loads of potentials in this game but the game being Early Access and such a show of performance made me loose my confidence in the game.Fast forward to 1 month later after refund I saw that the game received many updates and the devs even promised weekly (small update) and monthly (big updates). So I thought why not give it a try again and now I can't even put this game down.Now I am getting above 100 fps and the game it soo much fun with my squad. I will surely recommend this game to everyone of you. Also the game is set to receive new maps and even a ZOMBIE MOD!!!!!!!!!!!!.The best part about this game isn't even the game itself. I purchased the game again because the devs fulfilled their promise of providing constant updates and they haven't disappointed me.Edit Well initially they started well and lived up to their hype but in recent months the state of the game has detoriated very rapidly. They have literally made this game a cash cow. The only thing they keep on adding is stupid crates and skins. Desync and lag is one of the biggest problems from the start and even after 1 year these guys are unable to rectify it. Personally I haven't seen any devs who are incompetent to this level. I won't recommend this game to any sane person. Video games are supposed to be fun but playing Pubg will only frustrate you. Endlessly looting for 30 mins without seeing a single enemy and then die from a camper without even shooting a single bullet lol. That's Pubg for you.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-12-01,0,0,594,False,Recommended,Game is fun with friends. Lots of laught and funny moments. I don't usually play FPS games or any shooting games. But Pubg has many aspect more than just shooting your enemies. If you like having fun and get adrenaline. Heart pounting. Recoment to try this game. ) Thinks aren't fun are those bluezone. No time for camping in one spot or you will die. But I guess that makes each match difference. There is a bit lagg for me (not newest graphiccard) but it doesn't cost game play.

2018-01-25,0,0,269,False,Not Recommended,I'm gonna start to say that this game are fun to play sometimes with friends. With that said I still will not recommend buying this game and here is why.*Its now released as a COMPLETE game by the developers. For that me that should indicate that its 100% playable without major bugs. In that regard developers have absolutly on us players in that way the game still holds major physics bugs FPS drops lag spikes major glitches etc. To even say that this is not early acces anymore is to ignore the gamers and just focus on profit.*Aimbotting the game still is incapable to restrict cheaters. Sure cheaters exist in every game but when you have cheaters in 40% of the games you play it becomes very obnoxious.* Since it doesn't have a story mode it should have a large variety off other stuff. This game only provides 2 maps. With 1 map changing weather (which for me should be a standard) and the other map is plain desert. Yes they will add more stuff in the future but as they released as a full game with two maps ONLY its honestly so damn Conclusion The most sold game of 2017 with Millions of copies sold on steam and consoles now released as a full game with major physics bugs lag spike glithes low variety of scenery now added loot crates that needs key to be bought in order to open it. If this was still early access and cost around 20eu I would recommend this. But for me the developers and their team is solely focusing on money instead of game this game will die out shortly.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Well I have over 260 hours as of now and some good 3 months after early access is no longer a thing I am still NOT going to recommend this game to anyone that's looking for a balanced and well played BR experience. This game just doesn't do. And I wish it had so badly. I put my home into the studio behind this game that something in their pretty little korean heads will tick ""ON"" as if a light bulp struck light. But sadly It doesn't take even that to make this game an enjoyable all around experience. All it takes is LISTENING to the community feedback which these clowns just do not. All it takes is a LITTLE bit more transparency. You have the most played game on earth by concurrent players for god's sake. Then ACT like it. Don't pretend you're some early access indie studio. Okay? You're not. You have an obligation and as of this review you have failed it immensely. I sincerely suggest you start getting your together bring more content and updates work on the netcode remove useless stuff like the redzones clothing spawns and bring a genuine BR experience.

2017-07-18,0,0,177,True,Recommended,It's simple. Playerunknown's Battlegrounds offers an exceptionally tense yet fun experience.Right from the get go you jump from a plane fighting for the best landing areas and hoping that nobody lands close to you.As soon as you land it's a mad scramble to get a gun and armour before anyone else can. Fail at this and you're deader than dead.Once you've got yourself a gun and some armour you've got 2 choices. Run further into the combat zone and try to find a good position to take everyone else out or hide and hope nobody finds you. Running into the combat zone is a good idea if you're looking to get higher tier loot but others will have the same idea. This strategy is a high risk high reward strategy if pulled off correctly. Fail to do so and you will be punished heavily by people with better guns.Hiding works well but can be quite boring for the most part. You will occasionally get people skulking around and trying to scavenge left overs which can lead to a tense stand off. If you have a better gun and faster reflexes you win. If not you're getting shot to bits in a corner while crying. You can't hide for the whole game however as the dreaded blue (death zone) circle closes in and the white (combat zone) circle shrinks and relocates forcing you to move or die.Red (explosion) zones can force you out of hiding spots unless you're in a building.As the game progresses the blue zone moves faster and gives you less time to get into the white zone and the white zone shrinks in size forcing players into a smaller kill zone.8/10,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-06-23,0,0,677,False,Not Recommended,Where do I even start about this game.Like most players I decided to give this 'battle royale' title a shot after watching twitch streams/youtube highlights. I've been playing this game since it was in early access and it was fun especially when you play with your friends. There were multiple issues that needed fixing and that is where the devs massively failed. It's like they aren't even concerned about the actual performance of this game. BattleEye anti cheat is a joke. I don't intend to type in length about the poor optimization. Hit registration is broken. Many more problems make this game far from finished. Also the fact that the game developers consistently release in game cosmetics and 'battle passes' instead of fixing the core game makes me wonder that it all boils down to sheer greed. They had a great opportunity to take advantage of the the huge community that has stood by them during thick and thin.However I would not recommend this game to anyone due to its current state. The hackers have clouded almost every server. It's a pain to enter a game without getting killed by a player who shoots you from another corner of the map without any line of sight. These 'players' have hundreds and thousands of hours of game time which suggests that Bluehole isn't really taking this epidemic seriously. It's been almost a year since the game's actual release and desync still ruins the whole experience.I have given this game more than 600 hours and in return it did give me a lot of fun but that aspect is overshadowed by Bluehole's incompetence to fix problems that have made this game far from playable.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

This game used to be fun with friends until they too started to figure out how much BS there was. Don't waste your money. PUBG had it's window of opportunity and they blew it.

2018-03-10,0,0,1041,False,Not Recommended,Every update they seriously this game up. I had 130 to 144 fps finally after they optimized the game better. Then that 1.6 GB update cuased me and a large amount of the playerbase to lose like 1/3 to 1/2 of our frames (or they simply cannot open the game at all). These devs think they can sell crates and now weapon skins when they don't put enough resources into testing their updates and performance. I can say after many updates like this they don't test their updates AT ALL. What is the ing point of people going into your test servers if you don't use the feedback. These devs are incompetent and need to sell the game to someone who can handle it properly at this point. I have lost 99% of my confidence in them. The game and BR style is good in theory but their execution of it is god awful and the hitreg and servers have hardly seen improvement (aside from people no longer teleporting). You still get an unprofessionally/uncompetitively low tick rate during the crucial beginning of the match and loot still appears after you land on it. Those are just a few basic things that should have been fixed to fix core gameplay long ago. hhere's to the next BR of this general style being done right and putting PUBG like H1Z1 out of the market.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2019-01-02,0,0,96,False,Not Recommended,The Buisness practice that this company has is laughable. The Premium passes are 10 dollars and i have put over 46 hours and have only reached level 10 of possible 100 levels. The loot from the passes are also not worth it and the company expects you to shell out more money to buy levels. The Loot crates are also silly i used my battle points to unlock a crate and i have to pay 3 dollars to unlock it and at random recieve a skin i may not want. The game play is fun when playing with people who are not heads and you can actually understand half the time they are speaking a foreign language. Cheating is also a problem i run into quite a bit in the top 10 people left its hard to tell on some deaths but when people are snapping on head shots from 100 meters away is very lucky and i see it more then i think it actually is happing. I would recommend this game if it was free because if you are gonna make people buy passes and spend money on all these pathetic bland skins you should atleast make the game free due to the fact dota 2 does the exact same thing diffrence is the games free and if you would like to support the game you would buy the passes. The game also features more of a stealth game and when it comes down to it positioning in the final circle and where the circle is plays a huge role in who wins the game. wins are absoultly anti climatic so i feel no sense of reward when i do win. The fun i find in this game are the actual gun fights that remind me of socom II back in the early 2000's when tactical third person game was the focal point of online gaming before the Call of duty sensation. So untill theres a TTP other then PUBG that has its feel and is not a BR mode ill have to stick to PUBG and that is the only reason i play it other wise i would not recommend this game and would move over to new game in a heart beat but no other has that socom feel.

2018-02-03,0,0,312,False,Not Recommended,I like this game because I love putting effort into something for 15 minutes just for all my work to get ripped away. Nothing beats the sheer joy of fighting with your friends looting with your friends and getting shot from the opposite side of the map by a guy name W4ngDIngD00ngChang184665498122261. I cant describe the amount of enjoyment I got the first time I got killed by a man inside a rock snap to targeting me and my whole team man what a rush! Luckily for me I dont even have to worry about having to mute the in game chat I love to be called a monkey or other racist slurs by Chinese and I also happen to love their pop music and their national anthem the in game chat is splendid. Even the car driving mechanics are great. I get to expierience what it would be like to drive into a brick wall with a car full of my friends at top speeds it makes it even better that the walls are invisible its a great touch if you like suprises. Last but not least the parachuting out of the plane is fun too. My favorite part about it is when I land on flat ground softly but still take half my health as damage.

Filled with bugs and glitches (this is early access so what did you expect?) Filled with people who speak different languages from your own which makes teamwork almost impossible.Pros Fun with friends. Competitive game style. Currently very profitable for streaming.

Love it. However PUBG CORP/ Bluehole's negligence is really getting to me. Opening a door shouldn't be an anxiety inducing situation that slaps your through a wall and pushes you 4 feet away. Maybe the devs don't know what real physics are but they should seriously research them and understand that when a car hits a bump it isn't usually going to get air similiar to that of an exploding Jeep in an old episode of the A Team.I don't really know how I feel about it anymore.

2017-09-23,1,7,1089,True,Recommended,"Strategies PUBG is a game about survival of the fittest. While this can mean the most aggressive player wins it is by far not the average case. Knowing when to engage and when to lay low is key in having your first chicken dinner. PUBG rewards an active playstyle. Just as much as being too aggressive will probably get you killed being too passive will mean your opponents will have more and more of a tactical advantage through their gear. Making use of the ingame sound can make all the difference. Knowing where shots are fired where cars are driven and listening to that all too careless player stomping around in his punk boots all make for a great way to either engage on your terms or make sure you dont engage at all. Know your strengths and weaknesses. While most players would love to excel in every aspect of the game every player has their own strengths and weaknesses. Be aware of what you are capable of and make sure the situations you get yourself in favor your strengths and avoid your weaknesses. Make use of every distraction. Sometimes you are pinned behind cover with no way out or you know where an enemy is but can't get close without them seeing you. In those cases using grenades is not your only option. Make use of the red zone of the impending blue circle of nearby gunfire your teammates or even the loud sound of the airplane to get out of a bad situation or into a good situation. Oftentimes your opponent wont be able to track your movement.Playing solo As a solo player you will always have some blind spots. While some positions will allow you to make sure no one sneaks up to you as soon as you are in the open field you will often have to rely on knowing where other players are probably going to be. Always keep track of how far the blue circle is where the new white circle is and how likely it is that someone is behind you. Since you have no team to rely on a single unsuppressed shot even if it kills someone can lead to your death. Players around your position will have a vague idea of where you are while you probably don't know where they are. It is rarely advised to kill someone while completely exposed even if your target is ""an easy kill.""Playing duo/squad When playing with a team it is important to make sure that all players have the same gameplan. Some players enjoy playing fast and ending rounds quickly while others have a more tactical approach and aim for the endgame. If the team does not follow the same gameplan the players will oftentimes not work as a team. Further players need to work as a team. Players that 'wander off from the tour group' are exposing themselves and their team to higher risk. When playing with a team you can make sure all angles are secure at all times. This however requires communication. Make sure you use voice chat (or other methods of communication) to alert your teammates whenever something important is happening around you. Use the in game compass (or notable site names) to inform your team where and what is happening. An early death of a teammate does not automatically mean a round is lost and dying early yourself can be a great opportunity to learn from your teammates. If you are really not interested in watching the rest of the match when dead maybe do something else until the match is finished. Ranting will only inhibit your team even further.How to kill enemiesBATTLEGROUNDS puts you right in the fray and because of this it might be hard to take down players. There's three basic techniques you can use though dependent entirely on your style that can make you an absolute juggernaut.Ranged fireFirst and foremost is the ranged fire technique. This uses weapons with scopes to pick off distant enemies. Wait until your enemies are moving away from you in a clear line to open fire as this will remove most areas for them to hide giving you the most chance to deal major damage. Right click once for scope view hold right mouse click for general zoom view.A big part of this strategy is the idea of the vantage point. Vantage points are areas on the map that are higher ground than the rest or otherwise give you more and better opportunities for aiming and firing. Second floors of buildings tall hills and wooded areas are all examples of great vantage points as they give you a clear sight of the land and the ability to pick off enemies at range.Close and LoudClose and Loud is the principle of engagement where you fire on an enemy in quick sudden bursts after disabling them in some other fashion. This can include using gas grenades or flash bangs and then turning around corners to lay down heavy fire and other such techniques. The big goal here is to disorient your enemies making them confused and thus ineffective.High capacity weapons are important here as you're going to need every shell and cartridge to carry out these sorts of attacks. Keep in mind that a very important part of your loadout is the sidearm as it will allow you to put down resistance even when you've run out of primary ammunition.WaitPerhaps the best combat strategy is one not even of combat just wait. Because you're in a pool of many players you can essentially wait out the clock letting players kill each other before swooping in with one of the other techniques and clearing the area that way. This is a good technique but keep in mind that as the game progresses the battle area shrinks giving you fewer options for vantage points and assaults.Playing the mapA big part of BATTLEGROUNDS is playing the map. Understanding the general concept of where people are likely to go how to move silently and so forth are key to your long term survival.Moving silentlyIn BATTLEGROUNDS everyone wants to kill you literally. With enemies on every side all bearing down on you the ability to move throughout the map without attracting unwanted attention is incredibly valuable. Here are some tips to keep in mind that'll help you to this end Not everyone needs to be engaged. Firing your weapon alerts everyone as to your location and if you see an enemy who is particularly well equipped in a vehicle or simply in a bad spot to fire on don't fire on them. Track them and follow until they are in a vulnerable location or alignment with their surroundings before opening fire. A well placed grenade against an enemy in a building who you've been tracking will kill with a single loud shot as opposed to using a machine gun or assault rifle that will attract attention for your entire area. Move from cover to cover. Almost every path in BATTLEGROUNDS is lined with cover in the form of trees rocks or buildings. Moving through and between them is hazardous in the sense that you might not see trouble coming but it also severely restricts enemy vision and their ability to engage. Limiting attention and visibility in this way will make your movement easier. Be aware. When you hear gunshots even from afar move to cover immediately. Do not line up to the line of sight of people in the distance because you don't know their weapon ranges. If you hear vehicles coming get to cover if you see a single vehicle consider an ambush if they are going slow but default to grenades before engaging in light arms combat.Choke points and high traffic areasThere are a few areas of the map that are high traffic and should largely be avoided. These areas can cause you to be ambushed by multiple players each looking for resources as well so you need to wait and see whether or not the threat is worth the possible reward. These areas include most towns buildings bridges and the military base. While items will spawn here more often they attract players and thus raise the danger to new levels.This is a good and bad thing though. While the danger is indeed heightened it also means you have a good spot to set up ambushes and create choke poit",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-02-20,0,0,88,False,Not Recommended,i love the game. i think its great and fun to play. only issue is the last couple months of updates have made the game practically impossible for me to play. while i used to be able to run the game at max settings now i cant even get into but 1 out of 3 games with all my settings either off or as low as possible. once im in everything runs smoothly with the occasional stutter or (and this is much less common then it used to be) whenever the game decides it doesnt want to load anything in and im jus stuck floating in the air bc im inside a building. hopefully these things will be resolved eventually but its already been several months of not being fixed yet...but once it is this will absolutely be a recommended game again.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-02-12,0,0,532,False,Not Recommended,"After almost 400 hours of game time I have decided to right a review for PUBG. This game is bitter with a hint of sweet. The hint of sweet being a victory aka ""Chiken Dinner"". It pains me to write this review because I really want to love this game and it has a tendency to be very addicting. So Lets jump straight to the point with a Pros and Cons list.Pros High action if you choose Pioneer of battle royale A satisfying diversity of weapons &amp attachments Edge of your seat suspense when fights break out A decent gun mechanics system Relativily short waiting period to find a matchCons A not random loot spawn system. Certain areas are guarenteed to always have better loot while other areas always have bad or no loot. Some areas are a bit more random but only slightly so. That being said the varitey of loot within thoes locations is varied but the areas themselves is easily predictiable. Many areas in the map are renderd almost completly usless due to the fact that the border almost never goes to some of the areas on the map and there are no means of transportation near most of these outlying areas which in turn make it near impossible to make it to the border from that location. Many of these areas are well designed but have almost no play. The game is infested with hackers and cheaters. ""The devolopers are tring to stop the cheating but its not enough"" Server latency causes issues where you shoot your gun unload a clip on someone then die. You watch the deathcam and your murderer has taken no damage at all and you havent shot a single round. What you saw happen didn't happen server side! The most recent updates have caused an issue that freezes the game upon loading the map for many people. This did not happen before. The Devolopers and/or Publishers priortize making money with micro transactions and mobile versions of the game. It is a buisness I understand that. The issue is that there are so many issues with the game that should take priority to be fixed first to improve the game for the people who have paid to help the devolpment of this game. There is bullet cliping. Meaning that when you aim and shoot sometimes a bullet that should not hit anything besides your target will instead hit an invisible barrier in front of you or come from a different starting location then your gun and hit an object that should easily and clearly below your shot path. The border ends up being very predictible and rarely goes to new areas. The border collapse almost always goes to the same areas over and over again but not in consecutive matches. The flight path of the starting drop airplane follows the same routes over and over. Winning the game is heavily reliant on luck. For example you are in a building and a fdew houses down the road there is another team. Both teams are completly unaware of eachother. They decide to run the same direction as you but they leave a little bit brfore you do. You leave your building still unaware they are out there and then you see them ahead of you with no cover as they push foreward. Easy pickings and you have some kills. Luck comes in becasue if you left a little bit sooner you would have been the one killed. This happens in many ways and forms throught the game and this most of the time overshadows any skill at the game. Stragety is seconed to loot and chance when it comes winning the game. If you have a bit of luck and get some loot along side being skilled you have a good chance of winning. You can be the most skilled player in the game but if the enemy gets a bit of luck and better loot then you it will be hard to win no matter what.I understand what this game is supposed to be I just believe that if the loot drop system and the border system were better optimzed to be more truly random it would be a better game. The game can be fun but the Cheaters Glitches Border system and the maps not being fully used creates an extremely aggravating and unsatsyfing game most of the time. But when you win it is one of the most satsfying things you can expierence!I both love and hate this game. I would recommend waiting a while before purchasing this game until it is more polished and optimized. Then you wont risk buying a game you dump time into and end up hating. This game only has a 50% positive review on steam as of the time I am writting this. Good luck and I hope you find my review helpful.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-02-19,0,0,404,False,Not Recommended,I had a lot of fun playing this game but its overrun with hackers at the moment.There is currently a hack for everything. The last game I played there was a guy teleporting all over the map looting. His guns were visible on the ground (strangely floating in mid air) but his body wasnt. I could hear him looting and moving around and suddenly his backpack and weapons vanished. The entire area was scrubbed clean of all loot. This happened within 30 seconds of landing the maximum distance from the airplane with no one else in site...The worst part about the current hacking situation is that people are starting to hide them. (poorly at that) The replay system has revealed just how much people hack.I've played a lot of games with awesome AS players that want to communicate but every single hacker I've encountered has come from AS. It's just a fact.I can deal with all the bugs but I'm pretty much done until they fix the hacking situation...whether its a region lock ping lock or whatever..I'd really love to see this game get better.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2018-03-06,0,0,198,False,Not Recommended,PROS This game is EXTREMELY FUN to play. There is a learning curve if you're new to the game but that's to be expected. The game will get your adrenaline flowing and definately appeals to competitive type people. CONS Hackers are RUINING the game experience. It is very frustrating to make it to near the end of the game only to be shot dead by four or five hits with no misses...then you go watch your death cam and the person who killed you used a 4x scope with an M4. Their aim snaps to you and there is zero recoil even while they're aiming down the scope.At this time I do not reccommend the game to friends because the cheating is so very frustrating. If the hacking/cheating is stopped then I would highly reccommend the game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-12-20,0,0,1055,False,Recommended,"I've played this game since beta and it has improved significantly since then although it went through major growing pains and still does with each large update. I will say though in its current state that the game feels pretty good and I enjoy it. I don't think other (current) BR games can replace it because they feel so different. There's some real immersion here when the in game performance isn't ****ed up some real murderer/stalker immersion as you're the last of your squad left alive and you stalk your way to the top ten using sound and mindgames to trick your enemies.+ My shots now seem to connect appropriately due to the improvements in tickrate and server stability.+ Parachuting FINALLY feels good and I can land on balconies and other previously impossible to reach areas. It feels good.+ 3/4 maps (looking at you miramar) are fun to play which is good considering the scope of the game and each map. Many FPS games have a favorite map that gets 90% of the playerbase+ The UI overhaul is so different from beta it's insane+ The new matchmaking system is good the timers are helpful+ The ranking system is a nice addition. I still see issues with in game graphics performance. I understand that it's hard to have both good in game performance i.e. high frames no stuttering no lag while also having good netcode good mechanics good gunplay explosions aesthetic etc. In game loot system sucks pretty bad. I haven't tried any of the winter update loot but sanhok was a ****ing joke. Temporary items? No thanks.... Would like to see some kind of in game ""clan"" or community support where people can make chat channels and in game teams akin to what Warcraft 3 had.

2018-03-11,0,0,693,False,Not Recommended,I've been hearing excuses since early access. The game went through it's shakedown cruise was released as a retail product and is still a deeply broken unfair and frusterating affair. There are two maps but only worth playing. The one that is worth playing is still so badly optimized and the blue zone punishes anything but middle of the map slugfests. The second map is wildly unfun has terrible unique weapons is still fundamentally broken in areas(ladders don't reach the ground rocks you can clip through). The hacking is still pretty evident. The RNG means that even if the game instability (parachuting load issues etc) itself doesn't bone you you might still just insta lose because some 14 year old off his on adderall landed on a rifle with 90 ammo and cleans out the city while you run through 8 houses sorting through pants for pistol ammo. So fun. Then a miracle happens you navigate the laggy first few minutes maybe win and early fight or loot an uncontested hamlet. Congratulations on level 3 everything and every gun with every mod... you will be double tapped in the head from 600m away by a Chinese player with AK. Okay good game you cleared a city looted to the gills 3 kills per squad member... no one has anything better than a 2x scope. Cool. Zone is across the island on a tree covered lump of hill littered with bushes that look like players. Oh and some of those bushes ARE players and they all have scopes and mini 14/SKS/KARs with silencers... also they know you're coming because you were hold boost in a dune buggy for the last 2 minutes being run out of the blue. Fun.So many things have to go right for a match to even be fun let alone winnable that I can no longer bring myself to boot up work past the updates freezes FPS loss due to patches... just to be at the mercy of a bunch of people who load the game faster have bigger screens and a lot more free time. Or at the mercy of Chinese hackers. Or at the mercy of a massively unbalanced game.If you are really lucky like ALWAYS using the m16 with a 4x and have top of the line hardware you will probably like this game.

2018-06-20,0,0,69,False,Not Recommended,"This game release 1.0 months ago and has continued to either ignore or absolutely fail at improving their game in any meaningful way. The game optimization changes massively with each minor patch and they do not care about improving anything for the people who already paid only about doing things to get new people to buy the game and lootboxes. Their community managers literally beg for positive steam reviews from people on the PUBG subreddit because they know their game is tanking. They can't even update their website the first things you see on their playbattlegrounds website is ""Now live on Steam"" and ""Leaderboards/Replays coming soon"". Maybe they don't want to update them because the replays are still 100% broken and the #1 players on every leaderboard are blatant cheaters who have been called out with evidence on reddit and PUBG's own forums with ZERO response from any moderator or dev. If you're not a(n) (extremely popular) streamer PUBG Corp doesn't give two craps about you but if you're a popular streamer you get your own customized weapons skins while massive chunks of the player base can't even play due to glitches and terrible optimization making this game constantly crash stutter at terrible times or run at sub 30FPS on a $400+ graphics card.**** PUBG Corp and **** bluehole I'm waiting for the amazing day this game is shut down due to the god awful mismanagement of their business. They've sold 50 million copies and have 400 million registered users and not a single one of them can play the game without glitches crashes cheaters and just god awful optimization in general.

You ride on one of those bikes and you either go flying or you run over a microscopic lego brick and you explode out of nowhere. Bikes are a bad omen I'm calling it anytime one of those things show up on screen something is bound to happen that will ruin your experience whenever it be a guy literally hiding behind the actual bike or the bike explodes and happens to fling in your general direction because again these physics were coded by Satan himself. Besides the bikes the game also runs like trash you'd definitely want to look into getting a config and tweaking game files to really get a solid performance in game.Then there's the Chinese. Now I'm not one to judge a specific group of people or culture but I'm assuming everyone in China is a hacker. Honestly every game I've played thus far has had at least a few cheaters all of them speaking Chinese. Believe me it's even worse when you're paired up with a Chinese player because the language barrier destroys team communication.All in all the game needs serious improvements lock china out purge cheaters and fix the issues. I've been seeing some patches every now and then but it's a slow process currently will change it to a positive review once things kick into high gear and improvements are significantly more noticeable.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-06-22,0,0,350,False,Not Recommended,I bought this game in 2017. Back then there wasn't much problems with hackers and what not. This was my first Battle Royale Game I had fun back then and would easily get a Chicken Dinner. It was fun to play despite the poorly optimized gameplay. It had a lot of network issues new map wasn't horrible.Now in 2018 Bluehole dug a deeper hole by horrible PR bad performance hacking and a lack of region locking. Within a year it's possible to fix a game that is garbage just like how Rainbow Six Siege took a year or two to get better. It's funny how they're attempting to sue Epic Games for copying the Battle Royale Idea yet they copy the idea of using a season pass by renaming it the monthly pass. I'm strongly for region locking China because I've encountered the most hackers from there. Most people can agree that the chinese ruined the game by wallhacking aimbot and nocliping in the map. I do aknowledge that some people refrain from hacking from that region. After Brendan Greene called people xenophobes for asking the developers to region lock china It really felt like he said screw you to the players and to me. So screw you Brendan Greene for being sjw trash. Fortnite &gt PUBGFortnite has less hackers It's more optimized and they've got a region lock and they care about their community. 9/11 would uninstall,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-04-22,0,0,254,True,Not Recommended,Time to completely delete my earlier positive review for this game and replace it with this mini rant.To start off I'd like to mention that I want to like this game. Watching streamers such as Shroud and The Doc inspires me to keep giving it a shot despite all of the obvioius reasons PUBG is a sinking ship. I enjoy PUBG more than any other battle royale game on the market but lately it's getting harder and harder to stay onboard. I started losing faith in the game after Bluehole decided to remove map selection from Erengle and Miramar. This itself was extremely frustrating however it is extremely clear that Miramar pops up 80% of the time leaving Erengle in dust forever. The only reason I play the game anymroe is to que for Sanhok and I firmly believe I can speak for many. On another note after all this time and begging from the community for a progression system we recieve a 10$ pass on top of a 30$ game that is basically useless because most of the decent items aren't even permanent. The game should have gone free to play and anyone who bought the full game recieved the pass. On top of these issues the game still insn't optimized the servers hardly function and we're dealing with devs that are just NOW beginning to listen to the community. When you take a step back it's pretty easy to see how Fortnite killed PUBG.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

And the most original Really has unique and realistic things in the game which makes it amazing like the new Canted Sight and the Moonlight thing in Vikendi very amazing!! Really appreciated dev.... but the game needs to develop more as in make it more and more interesting plus matchmaking takes ages and quick join primarily puts you in Sanhok and Vikendi only while Erangel and Miramar doesn't appear often. Do something to make this game worth buying and amazing again so that more players will be interested to play the game. Add more cool stuff like skins guns emotes movement motions etc. Fix a lot of stuff like audio rendering crashes bugs hackers and more because those are one of the MAIN reasons why a lot of people hate this game so much. This game has so much potential in it to be the best its just you dev team to make the move. But after all of those problems I still think that PUBG is still the best game!

2017-12-23,0,0,118,False,Not Recommended,"Do not purchase this game To start off PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS was on of my favorite games in 2017. I defended this game immensely over the course of a year and I took that defense and fight all the way to mid 2018. PUBG felt clean it felt good and the mechanics were something new that I enjoyed getting used to over the course of time I played it. I never had an optimization issue (something that a lot of people complained about) up until recently and I never had issues with the players. I loved the players and the community that was this game. It wasn't until around December of 2017 though that Istarted to see a decline in everything. As the year shifted so did the player base. Call me racist all you want but around this time the ""Chinese Invasion"" started and there was NOTHING but rampant cheaters everywhere. Every game was the same and it was nothing but constant cheaters running to you shooting you then swearing and screaming at you in Chinese. This turned me away from the game for a few months. I downloaded games like Fortnite or TABG for the time being (until PUBG got fixed). A few months go by and then I return to the game. This is when hit the fan. I log in find out there's been a HUGE update. Me being excited I patiently await the update. Eventually after a long wait I manage to get into the main menu and boy was I shocked. Nothing but skins passes crates... as many micro transactions as you possibly could imagine. It felt like I downloaded something that gave my OS 8 forms of malware rather than the game I loved. The optimization decreased so drastically that with a super clocked 1070 TI I could only manage to get 80 FPS on medium to low. It was only when I decreased it SO drastically to the point of the lowest graphics that I could manage to get anything over 120 FPS. The cheating issue wasn't fixed either. Each game I got into was worse and even with my region set to my country I still managed to be killed by BOT accounts that had nothing but the same profile picture and Chinese Characters with numbers. There was nothing fun left in this. A large portion of individuals can critique what I say and that's fine but I have to openly say that this game is nothing like how it used to be and it's a terrible cash grab now. + The optimization is terrible even with PC's that are built to render feature length films or play graphically intensive titles. + The community is almost nothing but older men who scream the N Word 24/7 or get off to trash talking kids in game. That and the fact that the whole region issue isn't fixed we get put against Chinese Cheaters 24/7.So have fun finding a game that doesn't take 10 mins to load into and then get killed by a guy named ""瞄準機器人123"".",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-05-29,0,0,83,True,Not Recommended,This game is simultaneously amazing and unplayable (for now). The huge map and 'battle royale' style mean that you spend huge amounts of time in each round with no other players in sight just looting and jockeying for position. The problem is that once you *do* find someone to fight you've got a decent chance that the game sharts the bed the instant that you engage. There is nothing more frustrating than looting for 20 minutes to prepare (at 90fps) and making it to the final 15 or so players only for the game to glitch so badly that you get 1 frame per second as soon as the bullets start flying.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-10-11,0,0,531,False,Not Recommended,This game is great and all but also it's bad. Devs are really poor the way they treat us players. I'm talkijng about the nickle and diming of course... I have 20x crates that I can't open without buying a key and the loot is a total joke so totally not worth it. You can unlock items via missions but they're TIMED! Meaning you can't keep it and also most of those items are lame as well (Like a brown pair of shoes type of lame). It's just such a dumb system clearly they are putting in the lowest amount of effort to nickle and dime us. I can't believe anyone pays for these items with real money. IT'S ALL CRAP!Also how do these servers work because I've never seen so many Chinese players? They should have a massive ping but as far as I can tell there seems to be no disadvantage and on an American server they seem to have no problem killing people at all. That's not the case in literally every other game. The net code has lot's of issues you don't notice for a while but it's pretty weak. Biggest issue STILL tons of hackersl in this game which is just a joke. I feel like the devs don't really care about giving us a good unlock experience and just want us to spend MORE money on really poor items which is the main reason I won't recommend this anymore. With all the money they've made they should be trying to keep us happy and it's pretty clear they just want more $$$ with as little effort as possible... Just like how they use prefab models for this game... Player unknown really sold us out.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-01-08,0,0,494,False,Not Recommended,It starts off incredibly fun at first and will give you an insane rush in your first few matches. Winning your first match is a feeling that few things can compare too. But I'm going to tell you now once the honeymoon phase wears off this game QUICKLY stops being fun and you'll begin to notice just how awful the quality of it is. The netcode in this game is absolutely atrocious and is hugely abusable for players with a high ping. The extremely low tickrate and insane desync that results from it means that you're constantly dying around corners a full second after taking cover or worse dumping half a magazine of full auto assault rifle into someone as soon as they come around a corner only to get onetapped by them mid spray because they'd already come around the corner and shot you dead on their end two seconds ago before you even saw them start moving on your end. No ping cap or region lock means players can queue for matches on servers halfway across the world and instantly get an insane amount of peeker's advantage. There's a huge cheater population in the game that has been there ever since PUBG started getting popular. Aimbot wallhacks recoil scripts teaming in solo matches the list goes on. Battleeye does next to nothing to stop this. There are still bugs galore that need to be fixed some of which have been in the game since alpha. Randomly dying from fall damage just because you brushed up against the wrong wall/object vehicles glitching into walls or flying into the stratosphere from the slightest collision (admittedly hilarious but still in need of fixing) hit registration being complete garbage there's just too many to list here. But in their infinite wisdom Bluehole decided to let all this go through to the 1.0 release instead of actually making the game a release ready product.TL DR Don't get this game until it's actually in a release ready state if it ever gets there.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Also some things take a bit to render and that shouldn't be happening on my system. The most recent update has really done optimization wonders.A questionable kill cam (which rarely seems to display things how it should.)The hitbox/ping lag where you are surely behind cover but still get shot.It's a very rewarding game.

Some of the changes seem to take a long time but they do happen.So this can be a great game with a squad and lots of fun can be had. A lot of frustration can be had as well.

Even after the so called ""anti cheating"" update... EU server being by far the worst. Unfortunately for us living in South Africa this is the server with the lowest ping. 2) Bugs...bugs... and some more bugs! How long has this game been released? MONTHS in early access... and then official launch in Dec. The game is still terribly optimized. Still crashes regardless if you have a high end system or not. Black loading screen for days. Seriously how difficult is this to fix?3) Same old same old. Two maps to choose from. Same old gameplay over and over. This game started with a fresh concept that we all loved.... however... you get tired of doing the same thing over and over again. How about bringing some environmental changes? Sun down.... night mode....? Maybe some acid fog that randomly spawns like the redzone bombs?I'm loosing interest in the game very quickly.

2017-11-04,0,0,334,True,Not Recommended,Overall easy to tell this an early access game. Clunky mechanics random visual bugs game crashes every few hours server side connectivity issues and sub par optimization. I want to forgive all of that because when everything works this game is fantastic and fun and engaging. But what's really holding me from forgiving the faults is just the rampant cheating I observe every other game. I can't seem to go more than five matches without running into someone hacking in some form or another whether it be someone running at 80 km/h aimbotting or simply instantly killing half of the game lobby all at once from some unseen point underneath the map. I want to love this game so badly but I can't get past the fact that whatever system is currently in use to catch and punish hackers/cheaters is just not working like it should. Until Bluehole finds a way to enermously improve their anti cheat systems I just can't suggest purchasing and supporting this game.

2018-10-11,0,0,189,False,Not Recommended,I used to love this game when it first came out. Yeah it was buggy and utter sh*t compared to other multiplayer shooters of the time but it was the first battle royal I've ever played and I was hooked. However as the game increased in popularity it kind of lost its edge.Don't get me wrong many improvements have been made and the game is stunning compared to what it used to be. But the nostagia is gone. I'm by no means a great player but usually I can hold my own in a fire fight.Not in this game though. I feel like I fight the mechanics more than actual players struggling with loot collection vaulting and (worst of all) recoil. Many times I've found myself losing fights with enemies who have the same loadout as me. Obviously this comes down to the semantics of skill distance fire mode etc. but it happens so consitantly that it doesn't make the game fun. The point of game deisgn is to trick players into having fun and a sense of control even in competitive shooters. I like that they added a training mode and I've only spent a few minutes exploring it but that should have been added on day one. I never felt like i was learning my weapons since my engagements are usually short and sh*tty and now I'm so exhausted playing this game I don't want to take the time to learn it again.Another gripe is through basic shooting mechanics specifically with breathing and leaning. The aspect of holding your breath is awesome and I appriciate the realism. I don't like the consiquences though of such a mechanic. Your recoil returns to normal after you run out of breath but in reality there should be consiquences to being out of breath while trying to focus more scope sway and what not. Make holding your breath balanced and not broken.Leaning. F*cking c*cksucking goddamn leaning. Your aim is the steadest when your body is balanced not leaning at an akward angle. Its a trend I tried to pick up but obviously can't nail it down. Leaning like breathing should come with rewards and risk such as exposing less of your body but giving you more recoile. Its so small and I hate complaining about something so small but f*ck me sideways you're are more accurate while leaning and thats back f*cking *sswards.In conclusion if you like adreniline inducing games that frustrate you from basic mechanics rather than combat PUBG is the game for you. Otherwise join the screaming 12 year olds and play Fortnite. At least you won't want to break your computer screen afterwards.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I understand that im not a good driver but sometimes it just flips and kills you for the smallest reasons.Would like to see the driving mechanics to be improved.Another problem is when you go to pickup weapons/gear. Sometimes it takes 5 seconds to pick up an item and sometimes it does not even pick up the gear... This can be the judge of you dying or living. This needs to be fix especially in the more crowded areas where you need a weapon or you will die. A place where this matters is school and pecado in the new map. Even if i hit tab and manually drag the weapon it takes a while for it to appear in my inventory. This is probably just the servers sucking but its really annoying in tense situations. Finally the worst thing to happen to this game. THE ING CHINESE HACKERS!!!! WHY THE CAN THEY CONNECT AND PLAY ON NA AND EU SERVERS???? ITS SO ING STUPID THEY NEED TO ENABLE REGION LOCK SO THEY LEAVE OUR SERVERS. I DIDENT THINK IT WAS THAT BAD UNTIL I PLAYED FILL IN SQUADS AND I JOINED A TEAM OF CHINESE PLAYERS.

Can't play it anymore just keep getting stuck at loading screen I can actually hear whats happening around me but I can't SEE it. Occasionaly I do get properly connected (can't say what led to successful load) and still optimization in this game is a failure whose terribadness is surpassed only by Rust but since PUBG devs got so much money why it is so hard to pull this game out of indie level.Hence I DO NOT recommend this game unless you've got NASA PC or something. Otherwise you risk wasting money on game 1. You won't be able to play at first place (infinite loading) 2. Get lagspikes during loading new pieces of locations skirmishes against other players.3.

2019-01-19,0,0,56,False,Not Recommended,I've played pubg for 50+ hours now before writing a review. The game plays mechanically like most survival BR games. You drop in scavenge for gear and outrun a giant zone that shrinks the map down as the game progresses.The game has a load of varied items and decent map layouts. I'd honestly rate it positively if it's core mechanics didn't suffer so badly.My problem with PUBG is how it plays and runs. It feels slow and sluggish and can often be inconsistent.Your character seems to have 600lb ankle and wrist weights your movements mimic this.I think pubg would be an amazing game if they reworked some of the issues with interacting moving and shooting.It feels far too slow and clunky to get any sort of smooth or exciting gameplay experience. as a side note I also dislike the season pass and not just because it's a microtransaction. I dislike the way they show you rewards you've unlocked and when you click to claim you're then presented with the season pass page.

I'm just 1 of their million customers and I don't matter at all. Also that fact that this red info vac ban on my account that I cannot remove really sucks and the fact that they claiming they falsely ban people it's really really unfair. Well I wont stop anybody to play this game but to deal with such things vac ban or some whatever cause they can throw and the fact that you can't do anything about it plus red vac warning on my account its just like bearing a scar for just doing your thing and they put you where you at because they are WORKING ON SOMETHING CURRENTLY NOT WORKING!

Don't buy it!Update Game experience worse than in early access developers taking it in the wrong direction. Anticheat s with client performance but STILL tons and tons of cheaters with aimbots.Also vaulting added made the tactical skill ceiling lower. Crouch jumping was more fluent. Long jumping removed. Scopes all made worse. Game is constantly blurry. Removed options to edit gamefiles to fix client performance. Addition of FPP divided communbity shouldve stayed with one mode IMO (doesnt matter which one to me but FPP?)Game spatial sound is wank since release. Cant hear distances properly or make out from where sounds originate in the 3d space.They added meaningless lootboxes and skins. Adds nothing to the experience.Still a laggy mess.Still chinese wanks everywhere on every server (Input lag still bad.Tickrate still 15 or something.FPS drops still even with a billion dollar setup.Vehicles which were fine altered to the worse.New desert map VERY bad havent tried jungle (but same people making that one as the desert one i belive)Mouse sens not 1 1 you will have lower sens vertically for some stupid reason.

There are two main issues that will most likely ruin your enjoyment the first being no region lock this means players from China(there will be a lot) will be in the North American servers). The issue is not that they are Chinese and there is a language barrior the issue go with the main problem with the game and that is that there are lots and lots of hackers(mostly Chinese). Some get banned but for the most part they make very little effort to actually ban players who are hacking. Typically I'll play a round and I will either see there aren't many players left when its getting closer to the end of the match which is usually because a hacker is just killing everyone or I'll get into the final 10 and you will have the hackers use there cheats killing you off.Recap Good graphics good shooting mechanics and game concept is really good.Bad You will pretty much get hacked every round and in squad your teammates will rarely be players you can communicate with as they typically speak Chinese.Overall the game can't be recommended as the game maker will sell as many copies as possible without protecting players who Do Not Cheat.

Its a fun game overall and can be exciting and annoying at the same time....so I will list a pros and cons list to let you decide if its for you.Pros Game looks fairly nice on ultra Big following Fun in groups Satisfying winsCons optiomized horribly(better now but still horrible) lots of bugs such as getting stuck in rocks(not just the ones you try and climb I crouched beside one and got stuck and couldnt move) hackers are taking over the game hard to tell who is hacking you and who isnt because of no kill cam lots of running(cars can be hard to find sometimes) server lag odd issues playing in asian servers(it by default picks third person asian servers for me every time instead of remembering what i previously chose) horrible accuracy with 4x scope where the shot lands 5 feet from where you aim(at times not always and it that is standing still and holding breath no movement what so ever) did I mention hackers(last two days of playing have died to obvious hackers at least 5 6 times several in the top ten which I havent noticed all that much up until recently but now they are being super obvious)Steam could fix the issues with hackers if every account created was forced to put 125 bucks of credit onto it by the creator for future game purchases(instead of people being able to create new ones and just hack till banned and then create another)and banning every game on their account from multiplayer if they hack in one game and its proven that they were maliciously hacking not a glitch like the controller ban from dead souls 3. Just my opinion....,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-10-26,0,0,474,True,Not Recommended,Don't buy this game.This game used to be good but has turned to Back before it gained popularity games were smooth and fast. Now you try to play and you get lag fps drops hackers desync and lobby hopping. Joining a game used to mean playing but now it means joining and quitting games because people quit if they don't get what they want. Fog map? half your team quits and you have to search again. Rain map? Same thing. Someone doesn't have a mic? Same thing. You'll spend a good amount of time jumping around lobbies. The problem I most recently saw was the false bans battleye gives out. I was banned for supposedly cheating (says the enmasse employee) when I have never used a cheat for this game or for any steam game. They don't provide evidence because they can't since they don't have any on me. Clearly Battleye is trying to promote their anti cheat program by banning just about anyone on pubg. Hell wouldn't you as a gaming company like to see 25k 50k players being banned per month? That would mean its working as intended right? If I was a cheater and they weren't handing out false bans I would have been perm banned and not banned for three days.Don't just go off of my review though.

2017-10-29,0,0,219,True,Not Recommended,Game had potential but dev's are focusing too hard on mechanics that are not as important as the basic game play. For some reason jumping and vaulting seems to be more critical than the lag spikes broken driving mechanics server desync issues and hit reg problems. I understand designing and balancing a game are difficult tasks but if i wanted to play a broken shooter i could just play h1z1 or csgo. I personally will not play this game any longer on any of my accounts until the dev's can deal with some of the known game breaking issues.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-11-05,0,0,251,True,Not Recommended,After a successful launch I thought this game would break the mold from past poorly recieved early access games they had a strong leader of the community who listened and engaged with players. Since he left and signed this game over to bluehole it really feels like its a dumpster fire they've let the game hang out to dry in its current state whilst it rests on its laurels being a cash cow that it is. I dont believe they have any intent to fix matters in regards to cheaters (despite their recent 3rd Nov announcement) their main priority is to release it on xbox and open up another revenue stream make as much money as possible whilst the hype is there and then abandon it without updates. This review has been written after several red flags be that the failed update schedules terrible lag or cheaters and is written with a heavy heart as I really enjoyed this game but due to the terrible state of play and the cheaters the game isnt worth returning to play. Dont believe the hype sales either the growth lately has come from an emerging Chinese demographic and cheaters/hackers rebuying accounts after they've been banned.

2017-07-28,0,0,514,False,Recommended,"Ok this game is getting a lot of controversy and what i mean is people still playing this game wont reccomend it.Mostly due to salty players and broken promises.But here is my take on this game. (please dont mind my grammar and spelling mistakes!)This game is a hell of a lot of fun and probably the best royale game you will find.It has the biggest player base the best gun mechanics and overall the best maps that you willfind in any royale game.The character creation isn't crazy but its decent for a ""TPS Arcade style game""which means you dont need to go crazy on the creation because you only get a few secondsto look at your enemy before you blast his face so who cares.That being said there are TONS of Cosmetic items that are fair play and dont make players hardto kill its technically a fair play.The graphics are decent not crazy but they are nice.I also like that the devs are always adding updates and content for us to keep us interested!BUUUUUUT..... now here is what i REALLY do not like about this game...To start off the community is cancer and since its an ONLY online game thats a huge deal.But not a deal breaker. The vehicle mechanics are so terrible but playable.Driving the 3 wheel 3passenger bike is just a no go zone until you really get the hang of the mechinics.The graphics are not beautiful they are just ok and that being said i have no idea why the demand is so high..I mean a 4 GB GPU can only play on medium settings while other games with 2x better graphics can playon Ultra settings with the same GPU i literally upgraded to an 8GB GPU just to hit ultra settings at 60 FPS and eventhen sometimes i drop to 50 60... I also really dont like how much bluehole re uses assets in each map I mean I get into a new map which is supposedto be a different setting completly but the small assets like desks and barrels and broken vehicles are all the same.just with a different shader... There are also still many small bugs after its full release like in Georgepol when jumping from 1 container to another your character glitches and you fall in a game that really rushes you that is super frusterating.And last but not least the hacker problem ewwwww....... to wait in loading screens and lobby just to get killed by a speed hacker? soooo annoying!!!

PUBG for a while just sat there as the #1 game in the world for a while didn't matter about bugs or anything and long as people wanted to play the game and were playing the game. Then came Fortite and there was a huge debate on which game offered a better experience and what was more fun to play only at this stage when Fortnite started to look like is was going to overtake PUBG is when the devs noticed something there playercount was going down. The gameplay is very clunky and not smooth at all this game has no place in the gaming world anymore it has brought what it needed to bring as without we wouldn't have Fortnite Blackout or any BR games that became somewhat big.

With over 300 hours of gameplay I hardly experienced any major issues with servers except them being sometimes too busy and never waited for server restarts. One time purchase so far! You bought the game and that s it! Everything new comes in updates and you don t need to spend more money later buying DLCs or in game ""premium/special"" items. I m talking about weapons and attachments and not about clothes or weapon skins. No money advantage so far! You can t simply pay the developers donate/support the game more and receive powerful weapons or attachments or special status that will give you some advantage over the others. Game pays off for itself! You simply play the game and receive points after each battle (amount depends on how well you performed) that you can then use to buy crates. You can open them to find clothes and weapon skins but some require keys now. Whatever you get or find you can then sell on the Steam market and therefore easily get your money back. Negatives LOTS OF CHEATERS! Yet another game ruined by those ERS unfair advantage gainers. No matter how many of them are banned if any the problem still exists and in my opinion is getting worse. The most popular cheats today are of course aim hack and speed hack especially at the beginning of the game. Wall hack is not as common as maps are quite open. Loot hack is however a thing as far as I know this highlights or somehow otherwise tells/shows where the ""top/best"" loot has spawned so the cheater immediately knows where to jump or run to. /span&gt bad optimization! Low settings and constant FPS drops this is something you simply have to get used to in this game so far no matter how good or bad your computer is. The situation has been worse and slightly improved but is nowhere near to be acceptable. The year is 2018 in the 21st century and this is not the most complicated and graphical game. CS mechanics! Ah the old school shots through the solid walls terrain trees rocks. No matter how fast you make it to cover just in time the bullets will track and get you and even the best internet in the world won t save you because this is not the case. HEADSHOTS! This can be added to the above point but I want to talk about it separately. Another problem is what I call in game aimbot or the homing bullets. Could be partially due to the bad game optimization but definitely due to the game mechanics. The most common death you will see in the game even just by watching the death log is via headshots. I probably get knocked out or die 90% of the time because of headshots and no not because I am so lucky or stand still. I have checked even when I shoot especially at long distances and especially when I do it randomly without proper aim I knockout or kill someone by a headshot which usually is unexpected and really surprises me and no not because I am such a good shooter. I guess this is everything I find important to point out and what I could think of at that moment. Of course your money you decide but be prepared you have been warned ) P.S. Just in case if highly demanded I am happy to expand on some of the points or even to write a separate guide. Good luck anyways!",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-10-01,0,0,498,False,Not Recommended,PUBG has been my main game in my entire steam portfolio of games. The game was given to me on my 20th birthday by my cousins therefore it holds a special place to me. The player mechanics is the ace of this game as it takes Counter Strike which is the industry benchmark for shooter games to a whole new level.The game is still heavily unoptimized on many aspects. (1) The game s Battleeye Anticheat system is not the best in the industry. Literally couple months ago there was a hack that makes the cheater fly any vehicle across the map. Blatant hacking has been rampant in shooter games that it should not be a surprise but for a game that has been highly profitable and considered the game of the year by various bodies it should be a dying shame. (2) Furthermore the game s infrastructure can only handle so much. Having one hundred players in one game can be challenging for developers as the data input and output is just way too much for a not so big developer like that of Bluehole. Fortnite runs its game smooth since EpicGames has been a staple in game development industry. Lastly (3) PUBG s non conformity to continuous improvement has been blanketed by their money making schemes such as milking the players with fancy skins that would cost up to five digits in peso. Skins are neither what the community wants nor what the game needs it should be immediate action huge patch for hardware improvement game infrastructure and anti cheat system.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Hit detection is terrible. Lag is common. I could fill Youtube with videos of people hitting me while facing the wrong direction or death cams of shots that aren't even close to their target. My machine is plenty strong enough to run the game and I have a stable hard wired connection to on premise fiber optic internet. I'm an IT guy. It's not me.

2018-11-02,0,0,412,False,Not Recommended,PROS First of its kind when it comes to Battle Royale. Physics can be frustrating but sometimes hillarious. Fun with friends and sometimes strangers. Quick games or long games depending on where you drop. Variety of size mapsCONS Netcode Ping (I have a good provider and I am in Central NA). Typically close to 100 ping while other games I get &lt 60. Hackers Plenty have them. Plenty don't get caught. Some do. Vaulting over objects is just trash. RNG drops. Can go through a large building and not find a SINGLE gun. Lean mechanics are messed up. Crosshairs on certain guns and attachments are off. Random obstructions on the ground that completely stop your vehicle and hurt you. Certain guns need balancing....STILL. Game crashes...still. FPS fluctuates too much. Still not optimized very well. GTX 1070 Ti with i7 7700k OC'd to 4.8 Ghz and my FPS is all over the place. Sometimes over 100 but generally spiking around 60 100 and the amount of FPS tearing is ridiculous. Parachute mechanics could use some work. Shoes only for looks but you typically drop them for the quieter foot steps. No benefit to having shoes on. Poor maintenance times. Right in the middle of prime time NA. Head clipping seems to be a thing though there is also gun clipping as well. Still manage to shoot things in front of me when it seems like i should have a clear line of sight. You can't alt tab out of this ing game to right a review or it doesn't load in the next match. BP is a joke. The loot crates will constantly give you the same crap over and over again. The more BP you spend doesn't increase your chance for getting something decent. Loot crates are random and some require different keys so only buy keys when you need them.Things out of their control Human beings Racism Constantly a new hack on the market that they can't prevent. Anti Cheat is useless.This game is a decent game to play until something better comes out.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

This is only the start of the problems with this mess of a game the next problem is the crashing I swear every 5th update this game has makes you crash on launch and their solution is a 50mb megabyte update every single day and 5 15gb update every mounth making thing game basically impossible to play on data.

2017-09-04,0,0,680,False,Not Recommended,For the 93 hours so far the game has been worth it. With a decent PC you can run it smooth despite the fact it's Early Access. There's an active development going on and you can judge by the speed they fix things and implement new features.UPDATE 190 hours Game is still worth it. Very promising updates on the Test Servers right now. Can't wait for 1.0!Update 520 hours so far. And I won't play it any time soon. The developers on their fans with endless Monetization systems and very slow and inadequate optimization progress. Game ia full of bugs runs poorly cheaters are all the rage and to top it off we got a Battle Pass which is ing joke. $10 for literally couple of more pais crates. Yay. No you Buehole.

2019-01-18,0,0,22,False,Not Recommended,Here's my stance on all battle royale games like PUBG Fortnite and the rest which are usually bad rip off copies of both.A game shouldn't be based off chance especially when it's as crucial to such a game type where the ultimate goal for you is to win and yet if you land in say a big city and you know someone's in the house next to you what you 2 will get will be up to chance and it's based off this initial chance that your game ends or begins. If you're lucky you obviously find a weapon. If you're unlucky your opponent will find a weapon who can consequently end your game. You get frustrated and you return to lobby. And this process repeats over and over again. Your chances might be better if you que with a squad or something of the sort but what's the point considering the fact the game becomes much harder as co ordinated members will try to be taking you down as opposed to uncoordinated individual players in an all out in the act of self?Is the game fun? That depends on you.Is the game repetitive? Sure as hell it is.Does the game have replayability? Yes but it's incited by anger and frustrationDo I like it? No.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

(becuase it was) However they devs have done an nish job polishing the game but still alot more they can do. Im a massive hater of microtransaction so to see devs push them more than *new content* PSS me off. I think overall even though i personally play the game i wouldnt recomment its a very buggy and broken game and balance is all over the place. If your looking for a battle royale game well keep waiting for the one becuase this game is so badly over hyped and praised its stupid.EDIT Encountering a silly amount of hackers highly suggest you stay away from this game hackers a rampant and devs are not doing anything to combat it ing disgrace of an industry.

There is a ZERO reward system for its players zero progression all they care for is money. The rewards you do get is locked behind ""pay to open"" crates even then you get SH((*T. They are so focussed on creating skins etc. that they fail to deliver on what the community really wants. The community wants devs that cares for their player base reward people for putting time and money into the game and besides getting a chicken dinner play for something like a rank better rewards etc. Some people might play 50 games without winning why would they keep on playing if there is nothing to play for accept a chicken dinner (even then you get rewarded only a few BP points????)

2018-08-16,0,0,1395,False,Not Recommended,Okay I am not one for writing reviews but after playing 1300+ hours of this game since it's first conception until the latest map I think I can objectively summarize my experience with PUBG. I came over to PUBG after getting hyped up for these battle royal games such as king of the kill and the Arma mod. I spent a long time playing games like DayZ Epoch Mod for Arma 2 and the only thing that excited me more than that was an arena based shooter where one instant it could be calm and the next things are jumping as two people are trying to take pot shots at you from afar and another guy is in the house in front of you camping and holding it down. I was hooked instantly. I played mostly solo (managed to get in to the top 200 NA at one point after 3 solo victories) but also loved duos. Groups weren't my forte but I still enjoyed them with friends.PUBG is a great game. It's definitely worth noting though that it has it's flaws. A few weeks ago I uninstalled the game to my dismay since I have been playing Sea of Thieves since it's launch in March (which is a Sandbox game totally opposite of PUBG) Which surprised me. I love(d) PUBG. When it first came it out was pretty balanced. the weapons the map itself the vehicles. Every game was different despite the repetitive nature and the replayability was high. And it kept getting better. They added more features did a few optimizations and fixed bugs that would sometimes break gameplay. That is not what brought this game down for me. For me it was the net code. Not even so much the cheaters because I so rarely came across one in game (perhaps just luck) And also those horrible loot crates and paid events.. upon writing this review the game just became free to play. It seems like a desperate last attempt to regain player base again since people have been in steady decline. I would still have paid $30 for this game again I do not regret spending many hours playing this game it's one of my favorite games of all time. But until Blue Hole gets their act together and focus on the actual net code I don't think I can bear coming back for no incentive except loot crates that take $2.50 Canadian for a useless cosmetic item that I probably already unlocked three times already. I cannot reccomend this game in it's current state. There are better battle royal games now unfortunately.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2018-09-09,0,0,552,False,Not Recommended,I cannot recommend this game. I bought it from release and have put 550+ hours into it.I've put up with making it to the top 10 and a hacker just spins in a circle and kills everyone nearly every game before they really started cracking down on hackers. Even though the hackers aren't in every game anymore they are still very much active and almost to the extent of old COD servers. I've put up with the amazing amount of desync. I can peek out from behind a boulder and shoot someone 12 times and get blood spurts with each hit only to have them not die. I go back behind the boulder and two and a half seconds later I get gunned down by the same guy in the same spot he was in while not having any possible angle to shoot me at. Watching the death cam it is as if I was standing on the other side of the boulder when I clearly wasn't. There are many examples. This is only one.I've put up with the greed that pubg has shown. I understand that a company needs inflows of cash and with a $30 pricetag and millions of people buying the game that should be nearly enough. I really enjoyed the first iterations of the lootboxes. They gave me something to play towards as a cool reward. Now that most lootboxes have keys associated with them to buy I hate them. I don't want to have to play your unoptimized game to pay another $2.50 for a key on top of already paying $30 for the game. No thank you. They should have put the deluxe skins and clothes as optional dlc and not put up a pay gate to what was free in the beginning. They also make money off of the Market trading of the items and boxes.I've put up with the poorly optimized everything of this game. The graphics. The balancing. The simple mechanics of the game. Let's start with the graphics. When the map Miramar first came out I won my very first game on it. Was it luck? Skill? No not really any of those. It was due to the fact that a guy crawling through the grass was thought to be unseen but little did he know that grass stops rendering after a SMALL distance. I saw a dude crawling on what seemed like a desert but was actually a field of tall grass. I took my shot and promptly ate my chicken dinner. After I reviewed the match I realized he thought he was hidden and felt my chicken dinner spoil in my gut after knowing that my dinner was not earned but cheated. It takes a special kind of game where the entire community tells you to put your graphics settings on the lowest setting while only keeping view distance at max not only to actually get decent frames but to gain a competitive edge on the other players. Now let's tackle mechanics of the game. The idea of a closing circle where only one survives is okay. The idea that an AC130 would randomly drop crates of goodies for lucky individuals or those actually ready for a fight is okay. What isn't okay is a circle that randomly chooses where it wants to close in on is not okay. If the circle was always moving and had a designated spot (randomly chosen at the start of the game) this would be better mechanically. I've been in a top 2 situation when the circle has chosen the victor way too many times for this to be a proper game mechanic. That is my opinion obviously. Now for balancing HA! I just can't.I'm now uninstalling the game and will never play it again. Thank you for reading my review and I hope I have given you enough information to make your own informed decision on this game purchase.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-03-28,0,0,436,False,Not Recommended,This game will go down as the most successful disaster in history. Such a fun game ruined by promises never fufilled hackers and greedy developers. But the fundamental flaw in this game is that it's boring. Fun gun fights occurs either in the beginning or at the end and the rest is 30 minutes of running. Then add on top of that a few games with game breaking bugs and deaths due to de sync (you're behind the wall but still take damage because the server thinks you are still outside it) and you have a formula for a terrible and not fun time. Sadly none of the updates fixed any of the issues instead useless junk was added to the game to make the developers richer. Still better than H1Z1 developers but they all sail on the same boat essentially. Another one bites the dust two popular companies thinking they were untouchable due to their success in battle royal both now are owners of dying games. This game is still fun with friends but so is fortnite and that's a way better game atm so i see no reason to continue playing this game.

The game is still sorta glitchy the movement fells stiff but it is still playable and can be fun...can be... but the worst part about this game is the developers they are hot trash... around a year ago my steam account has hijacked and I lost all control to it and had to conntact steam support which they confirmed to me it was hacked into so they gave me my account back however when I got back on I was banned from pubg for no reason other then the hacker must have played on my account with pubg cheats. I contacted the support team showing the evidence proof and messages from steam support themselves but they did nothing for f*cking 80 days strait and the only replies I ever got where pre generated t messages.At least the twitter support team actully listened to me and helped get my account unbanned. Yes this game is fun and I still enjoy it but it had so much potentail that was ruined by these terrible developers who banned me for being hacked into... but I hope they fix its issues and maybe get a better support team that isn't blinded by there own stupidity,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-10-08,0,0,1189,False,Not Recommended,I saw one person say that PUBG players can never be satisfied... But how the hell can anyone be satisfied with the poor development going on for nearly two years? The fact this game is considered to be out of early access is a complete joke. The 'fix pubg' campaign has to be one of the worst things to ever happen in video game development history. They straight out admitted that they have fallen short on promises made to the community. Maybe a few more crates will help the game run better? I have hundreds of hours in this game... I supported this game even when most people I know downed it in every way shape and form. Patch 22 is the final nail in the coffin of PUBG for me. I uninstalled this game the day patch 22 was released. I reinstall it to give it another chance and what happens? I boot the game up and it crashes before even getting to the main menu. 1st squad game I was matched with non english speaking players. Latency issues were unbearable. 2nd squad game no one speaks english and I couldnt not pick up a weapon for whatever reason so I backed out. 3rd squad game still not matched with anyone who speaks english...

They've taken away the option to pick a region. There are no Oz servers. My pings are over 200ms I was getting that range connecting to Asian and American servers. What happened to the Australian server/servers. I was getting a better ping of around 30 50ms which is good. Now I'm getting a terrible ping. which makes for a crap experience. This also has nothing to do with my internet. Even before the region lock the Australian server was broken and you couldn't connect to it. Had to connect to another region which was not ideal.

You can choose your playstyle do you wanna rush to the most popular city or rather start your game quietly in a cottage in the middle of nowhere and slowly move towards the victory. Tacticality is very important in this game you have to listen make decisions and be ready to shoot at all times.

2018-07-26,0,0,444,False,Not Recommended,UPDATED 16/01/19 360 hrs playedSo my previous review for PUBG was negative from around September last year. In a few short months several improvements have been made however there are still plenty of shortcomings.The netcode is vastly improved although there are still uncommon sync issues I haven't experienced these myself. Playing competetively feels doable now and I haven't seen a noticeble cheater in weeks. The new map is very good but the map selection has effectively killed Solo Miramar games on the EU server and several others which is a shame for me as it's my favourite combo.The gun mechanics and balancing are second to none. The gun equipment and loot scavenging mechanics are for the most part very tight with only Vikendi standing out as being quite challenging loot wise in certain games. Getting to know each map is satisfying and in the closing minutes the tension can really get your blood pumping. Thankfully the new map has drawn some more players back in for a while and the population has been rising again for the past two months but it's far from its heyday. Bluehole need to listen to their critics set the game at a reasonable entry fee and drastically cut back on the prices of their in game purchases or simply make them free but difficult to achieve. The base mechanics and gameplay are right there and they keep bringing me back for one more drop. Every other problem with it can be traced directly back to how the developers have handled this game.As it stands if you like online tactical shooters but haven't yet tried a BR genre game AND you don't mind there only being 4 maps (3/4 of which are fun to play on) AND you don't mind the relatively steep price for what you initially get AND you don't mind the company trying to nickel &amp dime you for just about anything they can get away with (I haven't paid a penny on top of the entry price) then you'll probably enjoy PUBG. I do enjoy it althought this review might not sound like it.Things are improving but not fast enough.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-12-19,0,0,135,False,Not Recommended,The game has alot of potential the learning curve isn't so bad . It's kind of a stealth fps battle royal hybrid sorta thing not so kiddish as the other game with the storm. The maps are huge so the gameplay isn't so hectic you have time to think and strategize. Would be a bit more interesting if they injected some humor into the graffiti signs and billoards. How about some killable animals that make sounds too ah its just a chicken in the bathroom or its just dog crapping in the back yard or some pigeons on the ledge. The game tends to keep you on the ground in buildings and always looking for cover. The scavenging for weapons at the start of each map mixes it up but alot of players seem to have memorized where the good stuff is so kind of defeats the purpose and makes it alot harder for new players. A good set of headphones or surround sound speakers is a must. BUT ITS FAR FROM GETTING A THUMBS UP FOR ONE MAJOR REASON....CHEATERS!What I don't like.Cheaters Cheaters everywhere and no real plan to get it under control! Aimbot ESP No Recoil Macros even teleporting players. Cheating so bad it's even pervasive in their top competion teams with nearly an entire team getting banned from competing this past December. They need to get the cheat detection working well enough so that it stops most of them from even joining a match and perma bans them instantly just for trying otherwise its a no go on this game. I would not have purchased it if I knew it was so overrun with cheaters. NO EXCUSES FOR DEVELOPERS GETTING CONTROL OF THE CHEATING SHOULD BE TOP PRIORITY OVER ANY NEW CONTENT.Vegetation and tall grass don't render consistently for all players so you may think your hiding but the someone that turns down graphics my see you and not the vegetation... major foul. Vegetation render distance should be intrinsicly tied to player model rendering distance to avoid people that exploit the game in that way. No cover rendering no opposing player redering.There really is no rewards its all vanity items and you pretty much have to pay for them all. Even the better loot crates you can buy with game time earned BP require you to buy a key to gets some RND reward. Bah just put all the items up for sale for 2.50 dump the key and the crate thing either people will buy stuff or they won't the locked crates is kind of pointless.Matches are long but it seems so anti climactic sometimes and frustrating. You survive to the end but I can't tell if you really get anything for the 30 minutes you just spent gathering gear stealthing around finding cover killing the random player you encounter hear and there Something is missing in the reward system. Then you your #2 and the guy your against cheats with aimbot esp or no recoil macro and all you can do is report him and hope they catch him.I can't see myself playing this much longer the cheaters are sucking the life out of this game. Unless they get the cheating under control this game is not worth a single penny. I could forgive a FTP game overrun with cheaters but I think many FTP games do a better job of keeping the riff raff under control. This thing is paid for has microtransactions and season passes simply no excuses for developers not to have this problem under control. Get on board wtih VAC BANS so these people lose their Stream Accounts as well.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Suing Fortnite looks like nothing so much as petty jealousy and resentment at not being the biggest game in the world. It must be so very hard to only be one of the biggest games in the world. Just tragic really.We'll see how the legal system in Korea handles this case but no matter how it shakes out this is going to reflect very poorly on PUBG Corporation and PUBG. Rightfully so I'd argue. This kind of lawsuit only achieves one thing To stop competition and reduce consumer choices.It might also backfire in spectacular ways. Suing the company whose engine you're licensing seems like a rather perilous choice. I guess we'll see.""",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Maybe that means I need to be more observant or perhaps it's a testament to the game's anti cheat system which is banning more than 6 000 suspected cheaters every day.That's according to BattlEye which polices the game's servers. Its official account tweeted yesterday that between 6 000 and 13 000 players are getting their marching orders daily.On Saturday morning it had cracked down on nearly 20 000 players within the previous 24 hour period. The ""vast majority"" of those were from China where in game ads recently caused a flood of negative reviews of the game to hit Steam.In total the service has blocked 322 000 people double the number that was reported by the game's creator Brendan Greene aka PlayerUnknown last month. That's a rapid rise.PUBG continues to go from strength to strength it passed the 2 million concurrent players mark three days ago and today it peaked at just under a whopping 2.2 million official Steam stats show.

Large enough that you aren't always on top of another player vehicles are useful while also being small enough that generally it's not a painful chore to run somewhere SPECTATOR MODE IN TEAMS (No more sitting staring at a death screen for 20 minutes waiting for your teammates while also making your teammates feel guilty for ""leaving you behind"") Cons Server stability (There are semi frequent heavy lag spikes that can affect the entire server from what I heard this wasn't as bad in the closed beta hopefully this will be resolved soon) Performance/Optimization is quite bad Aside from those 2 negatives I cannot think of anything else that's bad enough to be worth mentioning.

And not just the funny small stuff there are indeed game breaking issues. Furthermore the performance is still ""ok"" at its best.

Textures not loading properly lag when getting hit not regaining air when resurfacing from water having to reload the god damn lobby to be able to join a game again... I could continue for much longer. Weapons you pick up are always in single fire and there's no option to change that.

The gun play is amazing and has now become one of my favourite shooters. I personally think the game has a perfect balance of running and action.

2018-02-09,0,0,105,False,Not Recommended,"Having brought this game in April 2017 I can safely say since those early months PUBG is nothing like it once was. Sure the childlike joy of looting and fighting opposing players can easily wear off in any game but Bluehole has made an art of destroying that thrill since October. I doubt anyone will ever read all the reviews posted to this game but at least the numbers can be interpreted as PUBG has since become an ugly mess.For most of my time owning the game I've had graphical glitches which make the buildings unenterable from anywhere for 30 seconds to 5 minutes. This computer ain't what it used to be but even on 'very low' settings? Well turns out it was just a simple game patch (of taking the game out of beta into full release) which fixed it. All in the meantime I got frustrated when I did want to play it as many other people definitely had performance related issues too. Keep in mind that this was never the case when I first purchased PUBG!As for the apparent Chinese overflow into the surrounding regional servers (which has served to be a severe source of discontentment in this game's community) I never really could notice half the time as I couldn't enjoy the game due to the fact 'my' 'potato' 'system' couldn't even load the buildings in the first place. So I guess I'm going to let the ""region lock China"" and calls for more legitimate hacking investigations (and not those silly stream sniping claims) pleas speak for themselves.But I guess I should've known what I was getting myself into with the ""Early Access"" banner explosive popularity and subsequent poor management of what is the fastest growing popular game for PC in the world (since Minecraft). It's just a shame I can't give a good review on what ought to be a truly successful and enjoyable multiplayer battle royal experience.Ultimately then 36 dollars (now CURRENTLY 40 DOLLARS) is far too much to invest (per game unit) considering the heavy issues this game SHOULDN'T (but does) have.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-08-03,0,0,771,False,Not Recommended,Fun game when it doesn't screw you in one of the thousands of ways it does. Riddled with bugs hackers and network issues it can be quite frustrating to play. Recently the biggest issues have been related to desync getting shot around corners and behind cover. The other big issue with the game is the hackers after supposedly fixing the issues I did see a drop in blatant hackers but they are by no means gone. On average I run into a hacker every 10 games or so the most common hacks I have encountered were no recoil/ESP hackers. In summary it is a game with a lot of potential but if they fail to fix these major bugs and deal with the hacking problem it is not a game that can continue to be successful.UPDATE 9 3 18Took about a week or so off the game and came back to play today.First game had a Chinese hacker jumping around with a DP which wiped our squad.Third game had another cheater which shot us all from behind a wall.Last game was a 1v1 for the match and I was shot beforeI even peaked the guy.Sorry PUBG but it is time to uninstall.UPDATE 1 13 19Not as many issues with cheaters anymore still issues with desync but not as bad now.I will change my review to positive once they completely fix the desync issues.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The very thought of the word sends a shiver down my spine. I laugh and shake the notion out of my mind I reminisce on the good ol' days of Minecraft... back when society had taste. Now society is ridden by a plague. ""Fornite "" the voice screams. ""FORTNITE!"" it yells! Make it stop. Please make it stop. Help me. They are coming and they won't stop. I can't give my son any money in the fear that he ends up like those other kids. They'd take the money and buy their foolish skins for themselves or worse influence my boy into that cursed game... If only I could educate them. Show them the truth. They think the poison that they willingly inject through their eyes is so amazing. No game needs developers that active. It's just bad news. There needs to be space between the developers and the users. And bugs? Those add character to the game. Without bugs in a game you just get a lifeless white hallway set in some dystopian future. There needs to be something that pulls you back to reality so that we can still grasp our humanity. Just thinking about the ideal state of a game reminds me of an old friend. Todd. A man of legend that quickly fell from grace because society just wasn't ready for his genius... That's a story for another time though. I must go now. They say the regime knows all.

It's the same thing over and over again playing against people who have put 2k hours into this and snipe you instantly either via experience luck or 3rd party programs. The missions were pretty bad and dull while the rewards were even worse.I suppose it's fun the first 100 matches more or less but it doesn't have anything else to offer.

In addition to that the servers are not so well working you will never know if your bullet actually hit an enemy and damaged them. There are times that if you hit the enemy in the head an amount of time enough to kill it you couldn't. Instead you are being killed with 2 or 3 bullets with a level 3 armor or helmet. Mostly this was occurring to me when fighting at close range (there are fps drops when you are near an enemy or fighting with an enemy close range). With these numerous updates almost 2 times a day i don't see anything visible that is fixed. And it is only getting worse and worse with each update.

I have spent multiple hours to get crates then I have to buy a key for 2.50 I still have no clue what I'm going to get. I understand this in Tf2 or Counter Strike but for a $30 game this is unexscusable and honsetly offensive that someone bought the game for $30 then not being able to unlock cosmetics with skill.

In a small mixing bowl add the ricotta and mash with a fork. Add in the 3 cheese blend Cheddar cheese eggs salt and pepper. Mix all ingredients thoroughly until you have a smooth paste like consistency. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and place it in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes. Make the Ravioli dough. Crack eggs into a large mixing bowl and beat them with a fork. Add water oil and salt. Mix. Add 1 cup flour to the bowl. Use a fork to mix the flour with the eggs water oil and salt. Repeat with the rest of the flour. Mix until a smooth dough is formed. Clear and clean off a large work surface and dust it with flour. This is where you are going to roll out your dough. Take the dough out of the mixing bowl shape it into a ball and place it on your work surface. Knead for at least 10 minutes or until it becomes elastic. Dust a rolling pin with flour to prevent the dough from sticking. Roll out the dough until it is about 1/8 inch (1/3 cm) thick or about the thickness of 2 stacked quarters. With a cookie cutter or upside down water glass cut out circles in the dough (will make about 15 20 dough circles). Ball up the unused dough and either roll it out and make a couple more raviolis or wrap it and put in the freezer for another time. Dough can keep for weeks when frozen. Just make sure to wrap well so that it doesn t suffer from freezer burn or absorb freezer odor. Fill the Ravioli shells. Take the ravioli filling out of the refrigerator and place a tablespoon of it in middle of a dough. Fill a small bowl with water dip your fingers in and moisten around the outer edge of the dough circle. Fold the dough in half over the filling making a half moon shape. Be sure all the filling stays inside. Pinch the edges together and then seal the edges of the ravioli with a fork. Make sure to press firmly and go all the way around. This will add a homemade touch as well. Repeat this process for all your dough circles. Dust the finished ravioli with flour to keep them from sticking together. Form the Shells and Fill Using a Ravioli maker. Roll the dough into two sheets Place one sheet on the ravioli maker and form the filling cups. Fill with the ravioli mixture. Lay the second sheet of dough on top and roll it out. This will seal in the filling. Remove and separate the finished raviolis.Cook the Ravioli. Fill a large pot with water and bring to a boil. Place the ravioli in boiling water for 5 6 minutes or until they float. You can also test for doneness by nibbling on the edges to test. If you don't want to make all the ravioli at one time you can freeze the rest Take ravioli out of boiling water with large slotted spoon and place on warmed platesServe it up.Top with your favorite sauce grate some fresh cheese over it and enjoy!",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-04-12,0,0,859,False,Not Recommended,There are no absolutely steps to better the game/gameplay from the devs. They keep changing the things that are actually okay and ''tweaking'' them. The circle was fine but nooooo they had to change it. The maps dont need any change but noooooooo they have to change little things in them without any gameplay consequences. Not to mention the ing crates that are released every few weeks so that they can make money off of the community. And while all that is going on the servers are 14 17 ticks ING 17 tick. And we CS GO players can tell that 64 tick servers are so bad. SEVENTEEEN TICK. The hitreg is awful as well. It takes so many tries to even connect to the lobby coz 'servers are too busy'. Actual games are plagued with cheaters from aimbots to wallbangs straightup shooting through walls and trees. There is no ping monitor coz they know that they will get flak on high it is. Many regions don't even have FPP servers yet it has been that way for the past year. The worst is the beginning of the matches too if you get down in a region with many people your fate is dependant on the whim of the game you can shoot a guy 10 times in the head and it won't register and he will kill you with a p92 with level 3 helmet in 2 shots. The cries of the community are falling on deaf ears. They are just in it to make money not improve the core gameplay of the game itself which IMHO in the long term will benefit the devs. #esportsready,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

There was no effort or thought put into the concept of this game other than to specific on a Trend. The game looks horrible plays uncomfortably (in my opinion) and the Company is a load of scumbags. Trend development does not make memorable quality games. It makes popular profitable ones. But I guess that's all they were looking to do.3.4/17.55 thank god this trend might be dying this is worse than most memes,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-11-20,0,0,33,True,Not Recommended,PUBGWhere do I start?First of all this game is no way at all worth $30 For that $30 all you get is one map a few weapons and fewer vehicles. You also see an assortment of basic items which are only obtainable if you can find them. As well as that the loot crate system is worse. You are expected to spend in game points of which are very sparse to collect (you have to endure the length of the game and kill a lot of people). These crates only UNLOCK YOU APPAREL. What a deal.Don't get me started on the actual game itself. $30 for what is a big game of last man standing. No actual creativity just a map and some physics. The fact that this was consodered for GOTY truly shows what gaming has become. Whatever sells the most gets the most prestige. It's utterly ridiculous and I'm appalled.Enough said. If you buy this game to play with a few mates fair enough. Do not buy iy because it is popular because it really isn't a good game.Have fun being bored while I play a game where I actually progress xx,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2019-01-20,0,0,37,False,Not Recommended,"Ok where do i start. I ignored this game for so long cause i hate developers of this game but all my friends love it so i had to eventually buy it. I played a lot on the phone before i bought it on PC. First of all i still can't believe that mobile version is better than PC version. Like that is a ing shame. I never once dropped from the game on mobile version. On PC version lag spikes dropping out of server connecting to a server in the first place is hard. Don't you dare do the alt tab your game will probably crash. This game even after two years is still unstable to the point where sometimes it frustrates me enough so i don't play it for few days. But even that is not the worst part. The worst part is the net code. Like honestly this game has one of the worst net codes ever. The only thing this game going for it is fun gameplay. Like honestly when there are none of these technical issues the game is fun to play especially with friends. But these bugs and technical issues really kills the experience for players. Developers focus more on adding more passes and skins and other microtransactions then fixing the game. Its been 2 years since it first came out and 1 full year since the ""full release"" of the game and technical issues are still here. So honestly i don't know if i should recommend this game. On one side it is really fun when it actualy works but on the other side a lot of times it just doesn't work well. So i don't know. My review is mixed but being there are only two options i will go with thumbs down. This game still needs a LOT of work from developers. It needs full focus on simply fixing the game and servers and less work on trying to add new microtransactions.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2019-01-20,0,0,276,False,Not Recommended,I normally do not write reviews for any games I play but for this game I need to make an exception. I always loved PUBG from the first day I saw it. With almost 300 hours ingame over the course of the last months I became more and more sad to see the game get worse and worse. When I bought PUBG it was riddled with bugs and physics glitches but I thought it is a new game and in these times that sadly does not mean it has to be polished when released and I thought the developers seeing how much attention the game got would try their best (and spend the time and the resources they have gotten through the 30+ million sales) to develop the game further and fix any major bugs/issues as well as adding some new maps. But (apart from the maps) the only things that came were microtransactions for ingame items and for keys to open the lootbox styled crates. And even worse with the last updates they seem to have implemented a new game breaking bug that makes the game crash everytime thus making it unplayable for me for the last months. (And yes I think it is a gamebased bug because I have tried already toA. Repair the game via SteamB. Reinstall the gameC. Wipe my C and reinstall Windows and then Steam and then the game.My drivers are of course all up to date aswell.)And I have not been able to finish a single round which lasts more than a couple minutes!So now I have lost all my love for this game and I write this review/rant to encourage everyone not to buy the game because such a behaviour from the developers/company should not be tolerated by anyone if we want to see better games in the future.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-11-29,0,0,532,True,Recommended,The game has so much potential. Will the developer achieve it? That remains to be seen. Rife with bugs and rampant cheating. You would think the developer whos influx of millions of dollars via sales on steam could afford constant updates to the anticheat program. But it seems they either are unwilling to pay for the anti cheat software updates or they just can't get ahead of the cheating. All in all the game is tough as nails to play but it is loads of fun when you find a good crew to roll with. I'd recommend you pick it up on a steam sale. Otherwise I'd wait until full release to see if the developer fixes bugs and actually pays for updates to their anti cheat program.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

It's UI4 engine but it runs like the in house Enfusion engine. Just as many issues with server tick. Don't anticipate most of the prominent issues with the game to ever truly be fixed as the devs are mostly focused on making this as attractive as possible for streamers (prime streamer bait) to suck it dry.Top that off with micro transactions for a pointedly UNFINISHED game and you have a recipe for an eternal EA cash grab.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-04-15,1,7,277,True,Not Recommended,"Want to love the game but its terrible in its current condition. The game currently has horrendous player movement/mechanics which the dev's have stated they will not change i spend 50% of the time played ice skating into things and 25% of the time in my inventory menu. Server's arent stable at all random disconnects server crashes are common. In a recent game i got teleported out of a match with 27 people left to a brand new lobby. Scoring system is also trash it awards people who like to play hide and seek ""PLAYERUNKNOWN'S HIDE AND SEEK"" should be the new title. Bullet desync is common place also parts of the map dont render in correctly so when you think you're in cover you're not! Loads more bugg's but i think you get the picture. Early access games in my opinion should come with a money back option button or dev's should only get money from steam on the release of the full game because all the time we get baited into the latest poop early access games.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2018-11-23,0,0,123,False,Recommended,I'll be honest I haven't played this game since March. This review is mostly being written so I can get the Steam Awards Nomination Badge. I do have a few things to say however. This game is at its best when you have friends to play it with. The game is slow a lot of the time but that's kinda the point. It works well as background noise when socializing and looting and driving around the world satisfy that urge to do something while talking. The vehicle physics were incredibly messed up when I played but I loved that. I loved driving riskly to push this game's crazy vehicle physics to its limits and it gave my friends and I some great laughs. This game can be both casual and suprisingly tense once you enter a populated city. This game's terrain make the combat very dynamic in a city with a lot of cover stealth might be a good option in combat whereas sniping might be a better option when in an open area. One of the major downsides to this game was the monetization and flaky servers however if you see past these issues surrounding the game the gameplay is very enjoyable. If you need something to play with your friends don't look past this game it can be a really fun option when playing in duos or squads.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-07-24,1,1,110,True,Not Recommended,Not a really exciting game. It's a campfest and sadly it's by design. You're pretty much at the mercy of the game and whatever skill you may have it matter much since it's all mostly based on luck.Best case scenario for you You MAY get a decent weapon and you MAY get a decent attachment to that weapon AND/OR protection and you MAY be blessed to be in safe zone which changes the game from a running simulator into a camping simulator and you MAY actually win a game if the above conditions have been met .Even then it feels bad as it's mostly boring camping where you kill a few dozen people who desperatly try to reach your location because the game forced them to go through an open field where you and every other camper with a scope can have a competition of who gets the most kills.The rest is a very poor experience which is what more than 50% of the players in the current match will have.Scavanging and running towards the safe zone while getting shot at from random sides you dont have time to check because of the limited time you have to advance and repeating it all over again with the new zone. Struggling with poor equipment to the point where you'd hide in a corner hoping to get lucky and backstab someone for better gear which to me personaly feels boring. Not firing a single shot because it'll draw attention you cant handle.If I have to summerize playing for fun feels bad and playing for the win feels bad. You either try and have a shootout with someone and have fun doing it provided there isnt a camper involved(good luck) or you try to win by which I mean staying hidden and not firing a single shot that will get everyone's attention and probably get you killed in the next few minutes. To survive means to avoid playing the game which feels like bad design.Playing with friends vastly improves the stale game by picking up the pace and action which death timers dont allow for.in solo play but what game isnt better when played with friends. )Also performance is a bit of an issue atm but will most likely get resolved at some point so it's not really a dealbreaker.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

A big part of this game is looting but that is incredibly buggy at the start of the game. This games shooting physics do not work quite often i will kill people without the actual reticle being on them. The lag spikes are disgusting the way your character moves in the first person mode is like wading through mud. Do not buy this game if you want to just get out there lag/bug free and have a good time with friends.4 months later all of this stuff is still true. Furthemore thinking about it this game could be so much more interesting and have so many more mechanics or just even animations (e.g. a melee kill animation better looting animations).

On countless occasions i loot 4 5 houses and find no rifles at the best i find a UMP. Then i get instantly killed by someone with a M16 full attachments witha Kar98k on their back. Its stupid and totally ruins the game. Even if i do manage to find loot i will often proceed to have a game filled with me running looting running looting running and looting some more this will then lead to me dying instantly without seeing a single person therefore wasting 40 minutes of my day that to be quite honest id rather spend fisting my with some thorn brass knuckles. However.............If i get lucky and manage to find some loot. get into a few gunfights get a couple kills. This game is really fun its guns are satisfying and fun to shoot.

There are many ways to play this game you can land in hotspots and play this game for kills or you could land in the most isolated places for survivability and most importantly all that loot to yourself. The developers while they are attempting to fix the many problems with PUBG they are ignoring the simplist solutions. The most requested change is to force a region lock to China as that is where most of the cheaters in this game come from but they also severely lower ping. region locking China would make servers and the game better.But besides the many bugs issues cheaters and glitches the game is just fun whether I'm playing with friends messing around or getting to the top ten just to die in a corner on a solo.If you are looking to buy this game read more reviews though the negetive reviews are mostly true I'm just optimistic.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2019-01-20,0,0,427,False,Recommended,it's a really fun game even more so with friends and vocal ! Actually I strongly strongly advise to play with friends or friendly people you find and in vocal. (but if you don't have lot of friend into these kind of game like me just join a gaming community there is a ton. I'm in TAW and everyone is super duper nice there 3 )I'm recommending it if you love some tension and strong learning curve (learning to handle distances with scopes spray...different with each weapon different if modded or not...)(it's cute because after a while people will have their preference on different weapon when usually in shooter people just all take the same gun all the time because it's the strongest here there is other thing to consider like yes maybe it's strong but can you control it well too stuff like that) but arn't a rager/flamer. don't play the game if you rage easily it's probably not for you. the games makes you work on long term strategies (when you have time planning your route when you track someone. making trap..) but also short term (when you are blocked in a building and a team is rushing you when you need to run for your life to get in the zone but there are fight everywhere...) reaction time staying calm when situation all of a sudden is going wild it's really nice ! Got a lot of jumpscare moment and lot of laughing out loud moment. there is still performance issue but I'm not too bothered by that it's a lot better than in the beginning only Vikendi seem a bit more taxing but it's still playable by a lot. (and Vikendi is my favorite map so) maybe people that downvote only play alone or are super competitive...idk...games run fine...I see a lot of pro player running the game fine too... I don't mean there is no performance issue problem but its not as bad as people are trying to tell you... (not anymore lol) the only thing I regret is the weather being disabled I loved the constant weather there was in the beginning now we have it a bit too but it's random and less powerful and not all the time. (I seriously loved the rainy map) I understand competitive were angry but still.... the biggest problem is cheater it's a lot better than before but still...and the feeling reports doens't count... my team reported a whole 8 chinese players teaming together that we encountered (that was wild) and we didn't get the banning message...that's a bit discouraging...even more so that I don't report very often. also another small complaint the mission...they are...really bad....I agree with Ibiza when he said on stream that with these kind of mission they make it looks like the dev arn't playing the game themself because 80% of them makes no sense and are no fun to do. I hope than for the new pass mission will be better maybe then will I buy it... but not this time (too bad because some cosmetci are really really nice looking but I'm not grinding annoying as heck mission for a cosmetic with a pass that I paid for (when I paid for the game already lol). but it's really a small complaint at the end of the day it's just cosmetic and as cloth goes and weapon skins you can take the one on your dead ennemies so I just steal for the game cool stuff that I find lol.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Miramar is a joke its 90% driving jist to hit a pebble and crash and die so dont play that map.

Gameplay is great with fast paced action and a good community if you find the right people the reigon lock is great you no longer have super laggy players in NA servers although there has been issues with people with VPN's getting sent to the country they are set in but servers are being maintenenced right at this moment to help solve that issue. Overall a great game dont listen to the negative reviews they may seem like its a bad game but they come from people who dont really put in effort to enjoy the game people complain about performance but it runs perfectly on a 150$ card (1050ti) unless they are too bent on running on ultra 4K 120fps which is unreasonable good game WELL worth the price",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-22,0,0,19,True,Not Recommended,PUBG a youtube sensation and why shouldn't it be we all like to see someone come out on top against all odds to beat 90 or so people the gaming industry relies a lot on youtube and youtube coverage can really make or break a game. Youtube made PUBG popular and I am not sure if that was a good thing or not but the general concensus is that it is. THis game has only one mode with a few slightly different variations. It is a belief of mine and many others that a game doesnt really need progression if the gunplay is good and there is a high skill requirement. Lawbreakers has no advancement but it is the urge to master it that brings me as well as others back to it. Lawbreakers has little progression only granting you cosmetics for completing a game. My point is that you have to have either a balance of progression skill and mechanics to make a good game or go really strongly with one or two of these catagories. PUBG has no progression the mechanics seem unpolished and wonky but what about skil? Well you lose over and over and you feel compelled to get that winner winner chicken dinner you try to be better than everyone else and only the most skilled people will survive. Not really. A first time player of PUBG who drops in to a cluster of three houses with a highly skilled player has a pretty good chance of winning if they find a gun and the highly skilled player has a pan. Now you might be thinking well this doesn't really work large scale. Well I can assure you I have gone for about 20 minutes finding an acog scope and a variety of hats and backpacks with nothing to put in them and then eventually getting shot down by someone who could have found an AK in the first house they looked for. The Red zone where bombs drop randomly is put on the map in random places and can kill you as you are running to the play area because you thought you could find a vehicle but the PUBG gods were not in your favor as you watch your health slowly tick down only to be killed by a person who managed to drop right where the random safe zone would end and they found an arsenal of weapons in their first house. So PUBG has nothing going for it in my books but for some reason the pull to win is still there and I still play it even though I tell myself it doesn't really matter what I do. All things accounted for though 30$ is a bit much. I would wait for the price to go down or something because $30 is a lot on steam and you could definitely do better than PUBG If you have $30dollars and you already own everything sure go ahead and buy it.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

But there are still just too many issues for me to recommend this game at $30 when you compare its competition. Yes it's half the price of your standard big budget game but you are absolutely getting what you pay for. The vehicle physics are lousy and will likely never be truly fixed. The netcode and server registration is shoddy at best sometimes headshots on your client just don't register with the server other times you can switch guns in the middle of an intense firefight and your gun just doesn't fire for a few seconds. Maps still have areas where you can get permanantly stuck and yet are overdesigned to the point where every tree every rock and every building is placed in such a precise manner to both discourage camping and to give a ""fair"" chance to those that decided not to place priority on positioning. Teamkilling and hacking are tolerated and I would bet that the developer figures that if a player is going to go through the effort to do those things they would probably then make the effort to leave a negative review if banned and not buy another copy.Bottom line for me is this When everything works it's incredibly satisfying. It has a blend of stealth strategy and tactics that no other battle royale game on the market today quite has.

2017-08-10,0,0,1826,True,Recommended,PlayerUnknown s Battlegrounds has taken the genre popularized by games like DayZ and boiled it down to only its best parts making for quick and accessible rounds of pure hassle free survival based action. Even though it s as rough around the edges it s absolutely worth playing right now. I will continue to play as it gets closer to a full launch and revisit this review with updated thoughts once it s out of early access.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2018-05-05,0,0,459,False,Not Recommended,The concept of this game is amazing and fun however the amount of cheating and all round poor optimization will have you struggling to stop yourself from putting your fist through the screen. And for a little while it was actually fun and the cheating seemed to go down but everytime the devs push a bigger update the cheating multiples by 10 and becomes almost unplayable. Most games you can make it to the top 10 then get killed by some prick using aimbot or some form of ESP/wall hack. Possibly the worst part is the daily 25 to 26MB update that is supposedly anti cheat updates yet the game is plagued by cheating. The servers are full of desynch and bugs and fps drops. IF the devs would put more effort into optimizing the gameplay instead of stupid visual crates it would be a good game. at this point save your money and wait for Battlefield 5 to drop.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-11-01,0,0,512,False,Not Recommended,"Yes it has good graphics and fun ballistics etc but it's the most popular game in the world for one reason winning a match is the best feeling you will ever get playing any game ever. That said there are several problems with this game. Now the game has been around long enough for them to be fixed. The reason they aren't fixed is because the developers can't or don't want to. There is literally no other reason. They have had more than enough time. It will never be fixed. Don't even get your hopes up. ""Fix PUBG"" is to this game as ""Change"" was to the Obama administration. Anyways the following are the main issues 1) Cheaters/Hackers2) Nonexistent hit detection. Your bullets will go through people every single game. 3) Teammates in duos and squads who act like they're in a solo.4) Abysmal matchmaking. You will be teamed nearly exclusively with asians unless you already have friends who play.5) Being killed from behind cover enemies (and teammates) who simply teleport between locations frame rate drops every time you look at an enemy enemies with no footstep noises it goes on and on. General lag and terrible networking. Probably due to the matchmaking issue above. Not recommended unless you already have friends who are good at the game.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

PlayerUnkown and his team need to stop caring about fortnite and start COMPETING with them. I don't think that's going to happen. This game has many bugs and glitches that have been here since day one. Everyone who's played since then knows. I don't how this game still can get 1 million concurrent players. They have millions almost billions of dollars and they decide to not do anything with that money to make the game less buggy and glitchy.

However playing it with friends is fun and I will continue to do so.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
