2016-12-31,0,0,656,False,Recommended,This game is incredible! It's as simple as that it's the type of game you don't have to deticate hours of your life to to play but it is also the type of game that can get really addictive. Roughly 5 minute matches make it the perfect game for people who have minimal time but once you play a chain of games hours of fun can be experienced. Personally I enjoy this game so much due to its multiplayer. You can play for fun or play competitively with your mates and rank up together. You have full customisation of your car (Aside from 2 DLC cars) so you can enjoy the game in your own unique way. This game does contain downloadable content but it is not pay to play. The DLCs in this game are 100% vanity and will not really affect the experience of your gameplay. Also the developers and the creators of this game actually LISTEN and will make and keep updates and DLCs that the customers enjoy. I highly respect that. The servers are placed globally so you can connect to UK US and more international servers. I would seriously recommend this game and the best thing is it is relatively cheap for the amount of fun I guarentee you will have. Enjoy! D,Rocket League®

2015-08-11,2,1,1311,False,Recommended,This game is a Must Buy... At first I imply bought it to play with my friends and didnt expect much but this game showed me up. I've spent so much time on this and still suck10/10 would lose to a scrub againUPDATE After 400 more hours I've fell in love with this game over and over again. No other game has pulled me in with this amount of force and kept me there to struggle and strive to get better. I've made 20 + amazing friends just from playing and when dealt with properly the community isn't as bad as it's being made out to be. This is far and above my favorite game I've ever played and probably the best 20 dollars I could spend. Beware though of a tough learning curve and some early on frustration as you start your path on addiction.UPDATE again 1.1k hours so far and I haven't put the game down in almost 3 years,Rocket League®

2017-10-01,0,0,619,False,Recommended,The game is basically football with cars instead of people but have to say haven't played a more fun sports game than this one. The game is very interesting and would recommend it to anyone who is searching for a game to have fun with although there is a competitive part to the game as well.,Rocket League®
2016-02-11,1,1,1375,False,Recommended,Okay so this game is nice. Everybody knows it and i have it almost since launch. Pretty fun to watch it grow to get new friends to learn new stuff. I remember to play casuals and distinguish pros from not pros if they could fly or not. Right now i think only Bronze 1s cant fly everyone can flick 90% of the population does freestyle. Also crates got all my money and ruined the essence of the game not to talk about all the CS GO players that came with it making Rocket League a cluster of toxic players shouting quick chat sarcasms at every mistake you do. The game used to be really fun now everyone is comparing their Even me i have almost 700 hours at the time of this review and man those were some sweet 700 hours. But im through this game it is extremely addicting and fun but so are hookers and i dont know any hooker that doesnt have aids.,Rocket League®

2016-06-03,0,0,1093,False,Recommended,Great game. I have almost 700 hours in this game for good reason. Rocket League is easy to learn and difficult to master and has a great learning curve. The devs actively try to improve the game's features functionality and fairness. It is very satisfying to finally hit the ball well then to hit it into the goal then to start doing aerials and aerial goals and many more tricks and skills. It looks great feels great and is overall a fun game with great features such as cross platform splitscreen and great car customization. Side note If you do buy this game on PC (which you would if you're on Steam) try to start with a controller and not a keyboard and mouse. A game pad has more functionality in Rocket League and other driving games and has a higher skill ceiling than a kb/m. Plus if you do switch from kb/m to controller at a higher level like I did you'd have a hard time adjusting to the different control style.,Rocket League®

2016-07-09,0,0,136,False,Recommended,Ahh what isn't there to compliment in this masterpiece of a game? At first glance soccer with RC cars can sound a little... odd. But this game is so much fun that even someone who has no interest in cars (me) or soccer (still me) can fall in love with this gift that Psyonix has bestowed upon us. If you don't have friends you can play solo and if you do have friends you can play with them too. I have the most fun staying up late playing with my buddies laughing and screaming with satisfaction if one of us scores a crazy goal. There's nothing more fulfilling than scoring a double touch aerial or juking someone so hard that all you can do is prey for their ankles.Best game of 2015. Best online multiplayer game I've ever played. Best sports game I've ever played. 10/10Do yourself a favor and buy this game. Remember it's easy to learn but hard to master.I'll never be as good as Kronovi. '(,Rocket League®
2016-07-25,1,2,287,False,Recommended,Overall fun game but the ball physics (which is 99% of the game) is very... meh. You will drive through the ball have the ball warp around you have the ball take the weirdest bouces off walls but if you can get past all that then its great.,Rocket League®

2016-08-21,2,2,2020,False,Recommended,It's a great game you have to play as if you were at least 2 people in order to win any ranked unless you have found someone your level and are queing with them. If you're solo queue you will be placed with people still learning the game (even though their account says master/rocketeer) with low turn rates no ability to save even a medium difficulty goal and an even worse reaction time. It's agrivating to then see their rank higher than yours even though you consistently have more points in every aspect. I can understand if it's me not seeing what I'm doing wrong but it's past that point. I cannot find one rando in solo q that will be better than me. I am not saying that to try and stroke my own pride. If you do get lucky and find a solo q teammate who isn't fully inept add them immediately. You won't find anyone better than you they don't exist. You can sit in goal making up for their mistakes then leave goal after their rotation is done so that you can try (as the only one on the team able to make a goal) to go shoot but you're then going to need to be back in your goal after shooting because your teammate won't be there. He will be trying to defend goal from mid field and at that point they will launch it with a side wall pinch or just shoot and it will go into the goal without fail over your teammates head. No matter how much you've done in that game in terms of saving offense and supplemental it wont matter. You've already taken 4 minutes and 24 seconds of defending hardcore and luckily managing to solo juke for a goal. But remember they slammed the ball into the wall without any purpose other than getting it away from you. It goes past your teammate because they're too busy watching from 15 feet behind you as they're too used to the ball never going higher than half way to the ceiling. They get a goal and end up then winning ot because your teammate gives up blaming it on the fact that they had picked up momentum after the first goal. After going through this same story for about 1.6k hours it gets a little tiring saying things like 'Was a nice try' and at the end of the game 'gl next time'. When you lose because you have above 1k points while your teammate has at most 200 the other team starts talking smack like '2ez' even though nothing has been said on either side all game. There's no winning in this game. If you're a nice player you only tend to find people playing the game for fun. More losses. If you are an you are viewed as confident and get other confident s who most of the time are still incompetent and are worse in the fact that they will not understand what they don't do correctly and will openly deny it in the end making no progress for themselves so you can't rank up with them for more than a couple divs before they get raged at everything.From my standpoint this is how the game goes. People who are too proud to be open minded and others who just want to have fun. There is almost no in between. It's a toxic game not toxic like csgo or league but it's toxic in a sometimes intelligent way. It mirror's peoples love for soccer in real life and I love the game for that aspect. All in all your teammates if you are not queued with a friend will either be slow because they are trying to play for fun because they got carried to a higher rank they should be in and are now trying to play it for themselves (ty smurfs you're doing the lords work for everyone under you) or you will find angry children who can't even see all aspects of this game. Fun game but not fun trying to rank alone.,Rocket League®
2016-03-24,1,2,806,False,Recommended,I rarely write reviews but because this is such a unique game I know there will probably be a lot of people still on the fence about buying this game and I figured an extra voice couldn't do any harm...This is hands down one of my favourite games of all time it is extremely rewarding and even though you will be absolutely shocking at the start the satisfaction from the progression from being an absolute noob to being able to achieving a crazy aerial goal (albeit luckily).This is best played with friends but if you play enough you'll soon find rocket league is full of great people and I've made some amazing friends with strangers through casual games. If you lead a busy life don't worry because the beauty of rocket league is that you can just drop in for a couple games yet you may struggle because IT'S JUST SO DAMN ADDICTING.,Rocket League®

2016-10-12,1,2,1352,False,Recommended,Pros The gameplay is a lot of fun easy to learn hard to master. Controls are pretty simple but i would recommend to customize it a little on gamepads (LB Air roll left and RB Air roll right). At the beginning it takes a while to get the hang of hitting the ball right like you want it.But with a bit of training and matching up you ll get it eventually.Graphics are good no epical super graphics but still pretty nice. But it s better this way so you dont need an ultra high end computer. Car models remind me on hot wheels. The maps graphical designs and variaty is very nice. From space station halo style to future soccer stadium style to old McDonald had a farm style. And i expect more to come.Cons The guy who constantly chases the ball.The guy who leaves as soon you as you trail by one.The guy who is always trying to destroy you.The guy who doesnt go for the ball even though you quick chatted Take the shot! The guy who goes for the ball even though you quick chatted I got it! The guy who is afkThe guy who tries to freestyle but can t.The guy who flames even though he is the one that sucks.The guy who constantly misses the ball.The guy who drives away from the goalie position.The guy who drives to the goalie position even though there is a goalie already.The guy who is just driving around randomly.The guy who wants to trade but noticed his keys have still cooldown time.The guy who is driving in circles taking all the boosts all the time.The guy who always fails. A liitle Rocket League story Rocket League Player Unknowns Diary______________________________________________________________________________Day one I noticed a stinch of fuel in the air. The countdown was counting down.............. It went down to zero and i had no real sense of what i m doing. I put the pedal to the metal but no use. I missed a big ball with the size of of a big ball. Our enemy seems to be too expirienced to get beaten.Overpowererd by the overpowering enemy the odds were against us. The enemy took the shot and i went for the epical save with a move not that epical. Infact i missed the oversized ball.It was 1 0 on the scoreboard and the clock said 4 52 minutes left. It felt like an eternity.The countdown was counting down................. again. My teammate went for the kick off oh yeahh and me too and my other teammate also. Suddenly there was a bright light that overwhelmed the whole playfield. Everyone was stunned. Top left corner said Rocket Jesus joined the match.Too bad i wasn t in the christian team. Rocket Jesus drove up the wall with the ball started to dribble through the air flipped around like the real Jesus would have done it if he had a car that can fly.Another goal. Enlightend by the moves of RocketJesus i went to the training grounds of the gods the free play.______________________________________________________________________________Day2 DeletedDay3 DeletedDay5 DeletedDay6 DeletedDay7 DeletedDay8 DeletedDay9 DeletedDay10 DeletedDay11 DeletedDay12 Deleted..............................______________________________________________________________________________Day 379 After months of training and training matches and matches that weren t training i finally see the light of freestyle.I started the match and again the countdown was counting down. I boosted to double jump and than boost again to hit the ball.I had the first touch. The ball rolled up the wall and i went after it. I tip toed the ball from the wall to the air i used my second jump just 1.5 seconds after i jumped from the wall to hit the ball to the enemy goal. I flew after the ball 360 flippin through the air because i had 70% boost left. Suddenly a bright flash again and the top left corner said Rocket Jesus joined the match....................again. I was dribbling through the air to the enemy goal when Rocket Jesus went for the epical save and started the counter attack. The ball flew through the air again and Motor Moses Rocket Jesus his teammate went for the redirect. Motor Moses redirected the ball straight to our goal when our teammate Nero the slayer of christians saved the ball with a super dooper mega barrel roll. Stunned by the amazing beauty of the save Rocket Jesus started crying.Our counter attack was fast and furious tryhard and the enemy team had no chance to save the ball. Countless tryhard attacks left the enemy no chance to recover from the countless goals we made.10 1 on scoreboard and still 2 minutes left on the clock. Overpowered by our overpowering power in tryharding Rocket Jesus and Motor Moses forveited the match leaving their best buddy Prophet of Redirect Mohamed behind on the battlefield. Two followers of the Prophet Maverick and Wolfman joined the cause with no use. They were just stupid minions. I tried to put an end to the prophets misery with the ultra giga hellfire spinner shot. But the prophet made one of the most epical saves in history. Unlucky his teammate Wolfman was too stupid putting the ball in the own goal.I looked at the clock still 1 10 minutes remaining and the score was 14 1 andfinally the last enemy realized he had no chance. He gave up leavin us in our glorious tryharding victory.,Rocket League®

There are a lot of maps cars and customizations but there's one thing that I hate about this game... the community. Sadly it's full of s ready to insult you for every little mistake you make. If they lose it's your fault if they win it's their merit.So yeah you should definitely buy this game you're gonna have a ton of fun but bring some friends with you!,Rocket League®

2017-04-13,0,0,1880,False,Recommended,If you haven't played you should. It's the first game in history to make soccer cool! (football for the rest of the world)Learning to play is fairly simple as their isn't much for controls but....When you learn to fly with your rocket propelled car the game really opens up and you start to really learn how to play.Their is more than just soccer modes however which includes hoops hockey and the newest mode dropshot where teams of 3 try to break the oppenents side of the floor than score through the hole they have created.Car selection is pretty good if you're willing to pay for all the dlc's and keys to find the others. Car's are mostly cosmetic with the shape of the vehicle being the only gameplay difference. (all cars have same speed/acceleration),Rocket League®

2017-07-02,1,2,99,False,Recommended,My message today is titled Life is hard and it s about how to live a great life despite the fact that life is difficult.Everybody wants to be happy in life. We all want to live a perfect life. We want that great job or a successful business. We want to be married to Mr. Right or Mrs Perfect. We want to have great kids. We want to have friends that stick by us come rain or shine. We want to be able to have all the material things life has to offer and have all our problems just disappear.Everybody wishes for good life. It may be at different levels. One person may define a good life one way and another may describe it another way. For one person a good life may be just having three meals a day and a roof over their head. For another it may be having a huge mansion and a couple of million dollars in the bank.There are different levels and meanings to what a good life is. But whatever you definition of it there is perhaps one thing that you may have in common with many other people. You might want that good life stress free. You would like to have it without having to work so hard or struggle so much for it. That is a normal human expectation. Nobody likes to struggle through life.Unfortunately that is also what may be stopping you from having that great life. The thought of all that work all that planning overcoming hurdles and resistance is enough to make a lot of people give up before they even start. It can all seem too overwhelming and for many it all just doesn t seem be worth it. It s like being drained of energy just at the thought of running a marathon. Before you are even at the starting line the thought of all that running just scares you and tires you so much mentally you just decide not to go for it. It s just too hard.One of my favourite books is titled The Road Less Travelled by M. Scott Peck. The first sentence in the book is Life is difficult. Now if you pick up a book and the first thing it tells you is life is difficult you may just think is this book going to get reassuring and encouraging after such a start?But as Peck goes on to explain once you accept that life is hard it no longer becomes an issue that it s difficult. He says Once we know that life is difficult once we truly understand and accept it then life is no longer difficult. In life you will have difficulties getting anything you want. It is very rare to get anything in life without some degree of effort. Only if you win the lottery will you have everything without effort and even then you would have had to go out and buy the lottery ticket anyway so it s not free at all.Life is hard your boss will not always be the nicest person in the world. Your job will have challenges that you did not foresee. Your workmates will sometimes be a pain. You won t always get the salary and recognition that you want and deserve at work. Your clients may not be the nicest people in the world.Life is hard your kids won t always be the ideal kids you want them to be. Your wife or husband may not be as perfect as you thought they were when you married them in fact I can guarantee you they are not. Your home may not be the ideal place you would want it to be. You may not the perfect wife or husband that you once thought you were.Life is hard running a business is not as easy as you thought it would be. No one is lining up to bring money to your business even though you are a really nice person and your business has great products to offer.I could go on and on with these examples but the bottom line is that Life is hard. I don t mean to say in all this that you don t deserve a break. I am not saying that you are not justified in thinking that you deserve more than what you have gotten from life and the world to this point.I am not saying that you are not justified in feeling the way that you feel. I know you have had it tough at times. I know that at times you feel that it s all very confusing and just too hard. I mean you have worked very hard. You ve done all that you possibly could in your life whether it is at work or at home. But things just don t seem to have worked out as well as you had planned or hoped. It all just seems to have gone wrong and you don t know or understand how or why.But that s okay. It s normal. That s what being human is all about. That s what life is all about. Life is hard. Accept that.Once you do you will feel better about your circumstances. Then you won t think of your situation as anything but what is common to every human being. Then you will think of your situation as a part of life. You will no longer beat yourself up about how bad things are or how you are not doing so well in one area or another. You will realise that you are only human. You make mistakes just like everybody else. You are not perfect just like everybody else.But don t stop there. Accepting that life is hard does not mean that you accept every circumstance and simply go with the flow.You see there are two sides to this story. There is another side to this coin. On the one side of the coin is where you have the words life is hard inscribed but if you turn that coin over you will five very small but powerful words. They read You can make it better That is one of the beautiful things about life. You can make your life better. You have total responsibility for what you do and how you respond to the fact that life is hard. As the now cliché saying goes If life hands you lemons make lemonade. Accepting that life is hard comes with accepting that you have the responsibility to make it better. Not only do you have the responsibility to make it better you have the ability and the power to make it better.You can make it better become a better employee and someone worth giving more responsibilities at work. The promotions and the better pay are sure to follow one way or another.You can make it better learn how to raise better kids and have a happier home. Become the good husband or wife you would like your spouse to be.You can make it better learn how to turn that business around. Gain the extra skills you need to run a successful business.You see the only person you have any control over is yourself. You cannot change other people. Let s take the example of marriage for moment. Notice that I did not say you should turn your husband or spouse into an ideal spouse. I said you should become the ideal husband or wife you want your spouse to be. Then once you become such a person you may have several choices as to how to relate to your spouse.Firstly once you are as near perfect a spouse as anyone can be your husband or wife might see the difference and also decide to change for the better or they may just change naturally as a response to your new attitude. Secondly if they don t change perhaps you will have reached a level of maturity where you are content and satisfied with who they are and their faults no longer bother you. Or thirdly in some cases such as in abusive relationships or in relationships that are a risk to your health you may reach a level of self acceptance and courage where you are able to leave that abusive or unfaithful partner.Whatever the case may be this example illustrates one other important fact about teh fact that life is hard and taking responsibility. That is You always have choices No matter what situation you are in you have a choice. No matter how bad things are you have a choice. No matter what you think you can or cannot do you have a choice.Now it may not be an easy choice by any means. It may be a very difficult choice and the road you decide to take may be a tough one. It may push you way out of your comfort zone. It may mean that in the initial period your life may get even harder than it already is. But it is a choice nonetheless.A lot of times you will actually find that the choices are not as hard as you thought they were. You may just hav,Rocket League®
2017-07-13,0,0,587,False,Recommended,This game is the best car simulator you could ever get/play! 1. You have different ways of getting cars just like in real life (you have to buy DLCs or open cases)2. You learn how to perfectly drive a car in different situations (use the walls or your boost to fly into the air)3. You can get petrol in the same way as you can in real (use the boost points which are scattered about the whole map)4. You get ranked for your driving performance (this shows if you should try to drive in real life or not)Bonus You don't need a driver license to use these cars!So if you ever are afraid of your next driving lesson just buy this game prepare yourself with some hours of practice and surprise your teacher with your new learned skills in driving!*No liability for damage or something similar* This game isn't a car simulator,Rocket League®

Common negative points Servers I've had one server with rubberbanding and it really didn't last all but a minute and a half tops select a relevant region granted I'm in the USA so I have the freedom advantage. No replayability If you play sports games you will have all the replayability ever it's soccer the replayability is the game itself. Shallow singleplayer Honestly haven't even tried singleplayer so I can't speak on it. EDIT I played season mode for a little bit on single player the AI is very smart I really wouldn't be able to tell the difference between them or real players season mode seems pretty fun you pick a team with a premade livery and logo and you get to select team mates go through a season of however many games you chose and try to make the playoffs. EWW HATS C'mon they're fun don't be such a grouch.This game is one to support and I can't wait to watch it flourish. Go on my friends list and ask any of them what I think of trading cards and badges they'll tell you I hate them I CRAFTED THE BADGE FOR THIS GAME I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHO I AM ANYMORE!

2016-05-25,0,0,1,False,Recommended,At first I found the controls a little difficult to master as they were very sensitive but I got the controller a couple of days after and found that to be a lot better. High internet speed is recommended as I'm in the highest speed area of my town and experienced lag when I didn't plug in my ethernet cable. Playing it is very fun and a friendly but competitive atmosphere quickly creeps in. Once customised controls are very responsive and games are fun. Granted I've not played for very long but I normally get tired of games very quickly but not in this case. In their original on the PS3 Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket Powered Battle Cars I played for weeks and weeks. I'd give it a solid 8 in all.,Rocket League®
2016-05-27,0,0,207,False,Recommended,I was very skeptical about this game at first. I dislike football and I don't really have something with cars either but what the heck it was a free weekend why not?So I started playing and I liked it near instantly for some reason so I kept playing for a few hours afterwards I bought the game immediately.What makes this game so great?This game is fairly easy to start and for people that have played some sort of racing game on a console/pc you'll adapt very fast. The physics in this game are fun and not too harsh ( like reality you would just fall like a brick but in this game you can make some pretty awesome air time). With this it is possible to do awesome air tricks and try to score ( which is a lot harder then it looks )But isn't this game repetitive?Isn't league of legends repetitive or every race game ever?You can make it as fun as you yourself want it to be. I generally play with friends and then it never gets old do stupid stuff and still make awesome goals. So compare it with league of legends you make awesome team combo's and you still enjoy the same map after a few hundred games.The soundtrackI still haven't considerd shutting it down it isn't anoying even so it is pretty good. Nothing more about that.GraphicsYeah no Would love to comment on this one but I am playing on a toaster so no comment. ( it does look nice tho )Final verdictI actually recommended this game to all my friends so we could play together. It doesn't take a long time for one game which makes it really nice for just one game ( HAH ever tried to shut it off after a winning streak? )You don't have to crack your brain on this game either it is playable for everyone!p.s. the communityWell this is fun. I have had a few guys that actually started cursing via voice and this wasn't the first time. I don't really mind I laughed they laughed and then we laughed. But if you you have a weak soul for faulmouthed people turn off the voice chat or only enable it for your team.,Rocket League®

2015-07-08,0,0,74,False,Recommended,I started playing Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket Powered Battle Cars when I was at my friend's house in the PS3. It was absolutely fun and we played it for almost 5 hours(yes that is kinda long). Now the sequel to the game just released and I am immediately excited for it.Rocket League delivers everything well from the gameplay mechanics customizable features graphics and... FUN! I have not tried playing this game on a mouse and keyboard though I've been playing it with a controller and it works fine. The game is easy to learn and hard to master. The only gripe I have with this game is that I have trouble connecting to the servers. Sometimes I can and when I do I actually quite amazed with the connection. I had a 154 ping(which you might think yeah that will ruin your game experience) but it didn't affect at all. It runs really well until someone joins the game and lags for 1 second but that is no issue. Of course there is no South East Asia (S.E.A) server which I hope they would make one.Now should you get this game? If you love driving(with extreme nitro and acrobatic skills) and a little bit of football then yes get it. This game is extremely fun. If you have friends even better! Go get it! its worth it. Encourage your friend to get it as well!,Rocket League®

It's amazing with friends local multiplayer flawed experience online but great if you can get the LAN party environment going for it. I hope they eventually have multiplayer league support and essentially every mode that major sports games have because they would all be perfect.THIS GAME COULD GET ME WATCHING ESPORTS.I just can't recommend it highly enough.They really do need to get to work fixing the online experience though.I know this review seems to contradict itself but that's kind of how the game is. It's crazy amounts of fun with friends it really needs to be played. But the actual gameplay deserves more/better modes and better online and matchmaking.And claiming random matchmaking is cross platform play is just dirty but that's on the publisher not the game.,Rocket League®

You will be ranked by the skill of people you play with and no matter how good you are someone is always bad enough to make your skill useless. Ofc this goes in the other way too.

2017-02-28,0,0,6,False,Not Recommended,Alright so I love Rocket League. I have many hours racked up on ps4. My cousin and I upgraded to the pc so that we could get those buttery frame rates. And for a time we did. We played about 3 matches earlier today and they went smooth. Had a lot of fun enjoyed ourselves blah blah blah.Then unfortunately we were unable to invite each other into a party. Every time we tried it gave us no confirmation that anything had happened and the other person recieved nothing. We suspected it may have something to do with our controllers(I have the xbox controller he has a ps4 one both wired into our pc) but unplugging them did nothing.After some quick googles I have gathered that other people have had similar problems but with no real sure fire solutions(at least none that worked for us). /Restarts didn't work verifying the integrity of our local files didn't work reinstalling didn't work. I love this game. ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT. But I can't recommend it for anyone who wants to play with a friend or family member because you may run into a similar problem. Please Psyonix please fix whatever bug this is. **It could also definitely be a steam overlay issue and I suspect it may be. If that's the case who knows when it will be fixed.**,Rocket League®

Right now (11th of july 2015) the game is ""trending"" and I expect it to become really popular. Finding players takes a few seconds. You can limit the region to search for servers (east us west us europa asia/australia). US seems to have a good number of players europe not yet so much. I did not see any server browser.I diddnt notice any bugs. But the game can be quite laggy if you end up on a far server and/or someone from far joins your server.should you get it? I think yes this is a game for almost everybody. I do not do racing games yet I like this. I dont play soccer games yet I like it. its just... fun!so if you can spare the 20 bucks buy it lets support the makers instead of yet another green light zombie disaster.if in doubt wait until it is available for a reduced price but I almost can promise that you will get a few hours joy out of it. at least for 20 bucks that is a fair deal!edit 24hrs later seems to have been a temporaty problem with the lag. no trouble finding players (eu) and lag has gone down noticeably. no more rubberbanding so far!",Rocket League®

In a small mixing bowl add the ricotta and mash with a fork. Add in the 3 cheese blend Cheddar cheese eggs salt and pepper. Mix all ingredients thoroughly until you have a smooth paste like consistency. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and place it in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes. Make the Ravioli dough. Crack eggs into a large mixing bowl and beat them with a fork. Add water oil and salt. Mix. Add 1 cup flour to the bowl. Use a fork to mix the flour with the eggs water oil and salt. Repeat with the rest of the flour. Mix until a smooth dough is formed. Clear and clean off a large work surface and dust it with flour. This is where you are going to roll out your dough. Take the dough out of the mixing bowl shape it into a ball and place it on your work surface. Knead for at least 10 minutes or until it becomes elastic. Dust a rolling pin with flour to prevent the dough from sticking. Roll out the dough until it is about 1/8 inch (1/3 cm) thick or about the thickness of 2 stacked quarters. With a cookie cutter or upside down water glass cut out circles in the dough (will make about 15 20 dough circles). Ball up the unused dough and either roll it out and make a couple more raviolis or wrap it and put in the freezer for another time. Dough can keep for weeks when frozen. Just make sure to wrap well so that it doesn t suffer from freezer burn or absorb freezer odor. Fill the Ravioli shells. Take the ravioli filling out of the refrigerator and place a tablespoon of it in middle of a dough. Fill a small bowl with water dip your fingers in and moisten around the outer edge of the dough circle. Fold the dough in half over the filling making a half moon shape. Be sure all the filling stays inside. Pinch the edges together and then seal the edges of the ravioli with a fork. Make sure to press firmly and go all the way around. This will add a homemade touch as well. Repeat this process for all your dough circles. Dust the finished ravioli with flour to keep them from sticking together. Form the Shells and Fill Using a Ravioli maker. Roll the dough into two sheets Place one sheet on the ravioli maker and form the filling cups. Fill with the ravioli mixture. Lay the second sheet of dough on top and roll it out. This will seal in the filling. Remove and separate the finished raviolis.Cook the Ravioli. Fill a large pot with water and bring to a boil. Place the ravioli in boiling water for 5 6 minutes or until they float. You can also test for doneness by nibbling on the edges to test. If you don't want to make all the ravioli at one time you can freeze the rest Take ravioli out of boiling water with large slotted spoon and place on warmed platesServe it up.Top with your favorite sauce grate some fresh cheese over it and enjoy!",Rocket League®

Overall the performance is great the concept is great car customization is great and most things about it is great. Is there anything negative about this game? Unfortunately yes. Opponent finding. Sometimes a rookie can join a semi pro and go against 2 veterans which is really annoying. This is something that really needs to be fixed because it annoys the out of people. Being 2 rookies and a semi pro against 2 veterans and a pro is no fun. You should play with people on your own level. Not 20 levels above you. Anything else? Yes. I Find it hard to play one of the maps with only 20 FPS. This one map makes my FPS drop below 20 all the time. But only that one map which I rarely find.Scores and Reasons Positive Factors Score +15+++ Graphics Graphics are great and not too laggy (Except one map).++ Customization Great opportunities to customize your cars as you want.++ Ranking System Ranking up is hard. Very hard. But this just makes it funnier eh?+++ Performance It requires no beast PC to run this game at all. +++ Fast Servers The servers are quite fast to find you a game. I Have not waited any longer than 1 minute MAX to find a match.++ Good Singleplayer / Training The singleplayer part is fine and so is the training. The training really gets you through the different scenarios and can really help.Negative Factors Score 7 Opponent Finding Coming against 2 veterans while being 2 rookies is VERY annoying and really makes the game annoying. Laggy Map Only this one map is laggy. Too much stuff is happening in this map at once. Stupid AI For the bots joining you or the opponent I can't say much good. Their objective Hit the ball no matter what which often results them in either completely screwing up your go for it or even score on their own goal which is REALLY annoyingOverall Rating and Score Positive Score +15Negative Score 7Overall Score +8Overall a great game which needs some small finnishing touches. Great to play with friends and it has potential to even become a great eSports game. I Do recommend this game.

It didn't really look like a game I would like so it sat in my library for awhile before I finally decided to install it. And now it is one of my favourite games! This game is so fun and addictive I can play it all night or I can squeeze in a match when I have 10 minutes to spare (the game length is 5 minutes but if the people you're playing with dont skip the replays then it can take longer). Psyonix is continually adding free updates like hockey and basketball which keeps the game fresh. The game also has splitscreen so I can play with my friends which alot of PC games these days dont do. The DLC is just cosmetic so this isnt a pay to win game.TL DR THIS GAME IS SO FUN! BUY IT!

2017-02-01,0,0,48,False,Recommended,Product received for free. Rocket league teniendo tan poca experiencia en este juego puedo dar una review... un tanto acertivaPuntos positivos Es un juego muy adictivo! demasiado diria yo si sobretodo juegas con amigos... tiene modos distintos de juegos y partidas para rank global.. asi como Dota 2 o Counter Strike Global Ofenssive..En cuestion grafica tienes buenos graficas para su tipo de juego.. considerando que empezo como juego indie..Los modos de juegos son variados... mapas excelentes Y MUY APARTE es su alta customizacion de carros... es excelente permitiendote elegir entre muchos carros (si los desbloqueas claro esta..) y muchas cosas mas PUNTOS NEGATIVOS Yo creo que el peor aspecto de Rocket League es la forma de como nos quieren sacar mas dinero... NO contentos con los cofres que se pueden abrir.. espera me explico.. cuando tu juegas cada cierto tiempo al final de una partida regalan cofres las cuales no negare.. traen cosas muy bonitas y geniales.. pero para abrirlas cuesta dinero (Alrededor de 1.30 dolares la llave).. no contentos con eso.. tambien tiene una seccion para comprar coches exclusivos que la mayoria cuesta 3 dolares ... La comunidad.. No es TANNN toxica pero tampoco es perfecta tiene sus flamer o gente que se enoja facilmente...Pues nada mas... Yo la verdad recomiendo este juego es bastante entretenido y si... vale la pena comprarlo.. a mi me lo regalaron pero yo queria este juego de verdad y cuando tuve la oportunidad me gusto mucho ) Gracias,Rocket League®

2016-08-09,0,0,408,False,Recommended,This game never gets old. Its such a basic concept yet its very addicting and very high skill cap. like with most good games it is extremely easy to get the grasp of you just shoot the ball into their net and keep it out of yours using a car but of course there is much more to it than that. I have now played over 200 hours and am still far from good at it. I consider myself decent but compared to the really good players i'm pure trash which i actually like. because i know that when i become that good i will be able to on noobs just like i get on now by extremely good players. New cars games modes and expansions get released pretty frequently to keep the game a little fresh since it CAN get repetitive but personally i haven't found it repetitive because of how addicting it is. The new cars/expansions are also fairly cheap (around 2 euros) which is good. 9/10 game for me,Rocket League®

2017-03-10,0,0,186,False,Recommended,Although the most powerful individual in the Roman Empire Augustus wished to embody the spirit of Republican virtue and norms. He also wanted to relate to and connect with the concerns of the plebs and lay people. He achieved this through various means of generosity and a cutting back of lavish excess. In the year 29 BC Augustus paid 400 sesterces each to 250 000 citizens 1 000 sesterces each to 120 000 veterans in the colonies and spent 700 million sesterces in purchasing land for his soldiers to settle upon. 216 He also restored 82 different temples to display his care for the Roman pantheon of deities. 216 In 28 BC he melted down 80 silver statues erected in his likeness and in honor of him an attempt of his to appear frugal and modest. 216 The longevity of Augustus' reign and its legacy to the Roman world should not be overlooked as a key factor in its success. As Tacitus wrote the younger generations alive in AD 14 had never known any form of government other than the Principate. 217 Had Augustus died earlier (in 23 BC for instance) matters might have turned out differently. The attrition of the civil wars on the old Republican oligarchy and the longevity of Augustus therefore must be seen as major contributing factors in the transformation of the Roman state into a de facto monarchy in these years. Augustus' own experience his patience his tact and his political acumen also played their parts. He directed the future of the Empire down many lasting paths from the existence of a standing professional army stationed at or near the frontiers to the dynastic principle so often employed in the imperial succession to the embellishment of the capital at the emperor's expense. Augustus' ultimate legacy was the peace and prosperity the Empire enjoyed for the next two centuries under the system he initiated. His memory was enshrined in the political ethos of the Imperial age as a paradigm of the good emperor. Every Emperor of Rome adopted his name Caesar Augustus which gradually lost its character as a name and eventually became a title. 198 The Augustan era poets Virgil and Horace praised Augustus as a defender of Rome an upholder of moral justice and an individual who bore the brunt of responsibility in maintaining the empire. 218,Rocket League®

2015-08-16,0,0,1699,False,Recommended,I have gamed for 20+ years. I grew up with Nintendo Sega SNES N64 Wolfenstein Doom Quake every sports game ever made... I've watched video games progess into modern marvels of technology lived in west LA where they now put giant billboards of AAA games like CoD in the middle of Hollywood with celebrity endorsements. Watching the evolution of the gaming industry has been mind boggling. And this game tops anything I have ever played. It's pure simplicity the beautifully tuned physics/speed/gravity... the easy to jump into extremely insane in fact IMPOSSIBLE to master (I regularly watch the #1 player in the world Kronovi stream and I cannot count how many mistakes and missed opportunities he has every game). This game simulates playing a real sport better than any EA game ever could. Think about how many times Lebron James misses baskets Messi misses passes/goals/gets the ball stolen Peyton Manning overthrows a receiver... they are the best in the history of the game and they mess up all of the time. This game is exactly the same. The amount of precision and skill required to master the game is limitless. When you beat somebody you BEAT them. You didn't lose because you were outcomped like in a MOBA or you rolled the wrong class in the FOTM in an MMO or from catch up logic seen in many racing games. You lost because you were outskilled. I've never been so addicted to a game in my life... not because there's some gear grind or arbitrary progression forced to make me put hours into the game. No... I'm addicted because I can always get better... always. I get a little bit better every single time I play and I've put 200 hrs into this game. It's amazing and a STEAL for 20 bucks.

2018-04-24,1,2,1105,False,Not Recommended,Sadly the game is turned into a shell of its former self filled with trolls griefers and tryhard toxic players which has finally resulted in me to place this game on the do not play list. After a thousand memorable hours playing with friends it's time to put this game back on the grayed out Steam library. I am tired of watching fellow teammates or even opposing teams kick and scream which does more harm than good. Not to mention the repetitive stale nature of this game that makes you regret sinking hours into it. Sadly Psyonix let toxic players run rampant for far too long. It wasn't until they started losing players did they finally take notice. Either that or Nintendo forced them to address it. I wish anyone who is trying to play this game solo the best of luck. In casual you will likely never end the game with the same teammate because of rage quitting. And the chances of you having to report a player in ranked is practically guaranteed whether it is for harassment or trolling. If you do not already own this game I would recommend staying away. Psyonix did this to themselves. Next time listen to the community instead of feeding the trolls.,Rocket League®

First off this game has almost the worst community only narrowly being better than the call of duty community but atleast call of duty has the single player so u can still play and have a bit of fun without having to listen to all the complaints from the ""im the best its just my team is quot gang. You can rank up pretty fast which actually makes playing this game even worst when u get there. The higher ranks are good really good! provides alot of challenges which is not a bad thing. But the community does not let you off with anything. Even when everyone on your team are playing their best theres always one ""l33t"" that thinks hes the best in the world and complains about the team and ruins the experience. There should be a bigger penalty for leaving games and forfeiting especially in competitve games. I played a game where each time we were winning the opposing team would equalize and each time that happened my team mates would vote to forfeit! EVERY TIME! and this happened like 3 or 4 times in a row. even when a game is only started and the opposing team gets a lucky goal in the first few seconds u can be sure there will be a forfeit vote! My advice is to play this game with the chat muted and play with your friends over teamspeak or discord. You'll be able to play better as a team that way and wont have to listen to the insecent kiddy whining if you can do that then i recommend this game! But trust me when u play and someone starts complaining about you being ""noob"" and then starts coming out with pre puber ""i shagged your momma"" jokes u will become more interested in giving a backlash than playing. Everytime that happens i refuse to even focus on the game and just let the other team win as payback to the whiney prick just because doing that makes me smile D",Rocket League®

With that said as someone who is not particularly fond of soccer this game is brilliant in its ability to turn what I consider to be a bland sport into something esquisite. The satisfaction of making a great save or getting a nice ariel hit is what keeps me coming back. Combine that with smooth car movement and team focused gameplay and you have the perfect game to wind down to with friends.While it does get repetitive after awhile short bursts of gameplay every few nights keeps the game entertaining enough to be a staple with my group. I would reccomend this game to anybody looking for a co operative focused game with casual relaxing gameplay.,Rocket League®

I started off playing my first 200 hours having fun and not having a care in the world. Then i got pretty good i practiced daily tried new things and the wow... i was 98th in the world got into platinum (season 1 top rank).... Next season comes along i hit the champion league (lowest of the top 3 divisions) i got up there with the big boys.. Every season after i have gotten into Grand Champion.. Got invited to play in the ESL tourney. I ACCEPTED! Now im a sweaty guy who takes his rank seriously..... What im saying is this game is for everyone you can spend countless hours having a laugh and doing all but playing around or you can take it to the next level and go into professional playing. The game really suits everyone and i would literally recommend it to anyone Honestly guys you cant go wrong with this buy.... Its not even that expensive really.10/10 My favorite game!,Rocket League®

The gameplay is great with a variety of maps to play and more comming it never gets old. There is an exibition mode (where you do 1 match with CPU opponents) also a campaign mode it is set up as Seasons of an acctual soccer game in this mode you take on bots of the skill level or your choice. The controls are great they are easy to understand easy to use. The CPU in the campaign mode and on the exibition are not that good. When a CPU gets assigned to the team you are on and you are in the lead your CPU ""partner"" will do a self goal on purpose going from one side of the map to your own goal. One thing that was irritating me was getting items. It isn't hard to get items you just play some online matches. I just keep getting dupes but wth the new update comming up that will no longer be a problem. Which I'm Glad to see the makers of this game hearing what the community is wanting. The CPU scoring on you is the only point I see that are not that good. It is not game breaking it is only a minor thing. Overall I give this a solid 9.5/10",Rocket League®

You land quickly jump and make a frontflip to dodge the third enemy they are past you it's you the net and the ball......oh nevermind your teammate just rammed you and screwed everything up ggHighly recommended but play it with friends trust me it will save your sanity.PROS AMAZING SOUNDTRACK SERIOUSLY WHOEVER MADE IT DESERVES A NATIONAL HERO TITLE (IT IS BETTER THAN HOTLINE MIAMI) Amazing optimalization the game will run no problem at stable 60FPS on a 2011 """"""""""gaming"""""""""" PC.

2016-07-14,0,0,251,False,Recommended,"Ok Rocket League Rocket League. The best analogy I can think of describing this game is a pair of fake knockers. When you first see or experience the surface of the game it'll be like finding tiddies but when you sink your head into it to feel the consistency of this game the truth will finally dawn upon you as you realize you're resting your head upon a pair of fake hooters.Rocket League is a game where two teams of cars are placed out on an open field and ""mostly"" play traditional football. The game feautures some solid mechanics for misc movement and controll. It's a competitiv and online focused experience where you'll be matched with/against others around your skill level or leauges above you.The game itself was originally designed with consoles in mind which you should keep at the top of the head fellow pc master race. In order to enjoy this game as a rather picky player there is quite a bucket of sins you're going to have to let slip through your fingers in order to enjoy (not take a at) this game.The premise of the game is quite simple indeed and the controlles are quite solid (When you pick up a pesant stick for what all thee hold sacred thou cannot with any level of patience and loyality play this gameth with our blessed interface which so cullionly forsook.) alas still not the best. As this game WILL feel clunky as all hell for some and despite a rather well feautured options menu it lacks the option to ajust your controller deadzone which is a rather... triggering minus. (And the developers actually defined an option in the input settings which governs the controller deadzone they just couldn't find themselves bothered enough to add a gradient bar in the options menu and title it accordingly.)Another nitpicky fact is that ALT+F4 does not work in this game. (Yes I do that sometimes.) But I really find that quite worrysome. ALT+F4 is a keystroke registered by the operative system Windows to attempt (not force) the current active window to close. And to this day I have not yet managed to deduce what causes this to not being registered while in Rocket League it's in no way been announced a feauture and the game definitivly has no need to lock down any controlls in game as some do. This little issue is likely the result of some shoddy coding and not a good sign by any means.Unless you find it to your amusement observing micro machines wannabees smacking a ball or find any entertainment value in the competitive thrill of hitting the ball and try to make look like a decent pass you're going to rely on good friends to give you any proper fun out of this. (Or you're after a ghetto TF2 where you don't have to spend money to get the hats labeled ""Rare""). Although there is most certanly a good amusement to master it properly. A friendly advice from one human to another. Mastering a few parlour tricks and magic tricks can net you quite a bit more use for quite a bit less effort.This game is an online experience it's community is UNsurprisingly enough ridded with saltyborn and the toxickind and if it looked good and filled you with false hope at first sight you're quickly going to realize you've stumbled upon a pair of fake breasts. Then again there are two kinds of people in this world those who mind and those who don't.Sen_ signing out.",Rocket League®

If you win you're called a tryhard and if you lose you're called a noob. To top this all off the devs killed it by essentially breaking the ball view feature and it hardly works like sometimes if you're even at the slightest different angle the camera just stops caring. All because if you spammed the ball view key it crashed the game. This game feels like it was made by teenagers and it probably was and it really shows.,Rocket League®

Scoring a goal has its own awesome feeling. Competitive and rewarding. You dont like Football? Neither do i You dont like cars? I kinda like them It doesnt matter.You WILL like Rocket League! Awesome Tech like themed. Awesome graphics.Cons Your pc's performance is based on other people's ping. Lagging despite the fact my pc meets the requirements but its easily fixed by lowering the settings.

2018-08-24,0,0,384,False,Not Recommended,"When I bought this game I thought it would be fun to play and kill my spare time now its not as fun at all. I've started to experience more and more problems with the game and it just sucks. What bothers me Community is utter ****. They will disrespect/hate everything if they lose and even if they win too. That's not the case sometimes but usually that's what happens in competitive games. Which is something not so pleasant to stay around. Sure you can mute them but for the people that like to chat while playing its a big disadvantage. I did not expected a church like community but seriously they are ruining the game. Physics make no sense sometimes whatsoever. Rocket League's physics are unique and does not have that many bugs at all but the ones that it has are just miserable.*When your car should land smoothly after a fast flip/turn in the air but it just makes you unbalanced for a couple of seconds that count.*When you literally touch the ball and your touch is not affecting the ball at all even though your car 100% touched it. I often associate this bug with ""going through the ball"" that is because your touch does not even count. This started happening much more often that I was ""used to"" and its ****. The matchmaking is not accurate. You will sometimes play matches against people that are not in your league or vice versa. The worst is to have better enemies than your teammates leaving you the same as being outnumbered because your teammates are bad. This is what mostly keeps you from progressing. The trading system is okay except for one big downside that mostly leads to you being scammed. Rocket League's trading space of items you can put in to trade is small. This benefits people who want to scam and trust me there are a lot. Some items for example are worth more than the trading space Rocket League offers and the trade for those items usually go like ""Yeah you put first your items then I'll put my item too."" Now there are people that really don't scam in a situation like this but lets be honest this leads to scam 90% of the time. Other than this problem the trading system is really okay. Connectivity/Internet issues. Its just... ****. I have to admit my internet is not the best sometimes but mostly it is just fine. *Sometimes you will see the ball teleporting or freezing and you're going to be stuck in a confusing situation that could lead to the opposite team scoring most of the time. *Sometimes your ping will be high out of the blue when you've had good ping all day long or you'll just have high ping randomly between matches then its gonna be fine all day. Or who knows when you'll have its random as hell.*You might have packet loss 50% of time which is bad in two ways the UI distracting you from what is happening and making the game ****.*Hitting the ball but a slight lag making your play bad. Unlucky/Annoying Moments. Rocket League is not really to blame here but those are some situations that are just ridiculous *When you spend a lot of time in your enemy's half trying to score and he shoots in the wall/counters your shot on goal and it goes straight in your soccer gate.*When you do a counter but you're the one getting pushed away and not the ball leaving the enemy in a better position.*When your teammates/enemies pushes you making everything worse.*When your enemy only knows how to demolish and push you which is so annoying because it destroys the purpose of the whole game. Don't get me wrong demolishing and pushing are strategies but its like keeping you away from the game if used as the people I've encountered. Now this mostly depends on your enemies. It happened around relatively small number of times so I guess its not that much of a deal but it is annoying. Those are some problems that I've encountered during playing. Rocket League is a great game and its a lot of fun but when those things keep happening and you can't progress anymore because of them its not so good.",Rocket League®

2016-11-19,0,0,867,False,Recommended,I started off playing Rocket League on my Xbox One when it came out earlier this year but i have now made the switch over to PC and it is such a huge difference. In total i have about 400 hours combined hours both on steam and on Xbox and i have never grown bored of this game. Rocket League is so much fun to play even if you are on your own or with a friend or two there is always something interesting going on. Watching RLCS season one this year has made me loved the game even more and has actually inspired me to become better at the game and eventually find a team of my own to play for and hopefully get somewhere with it all. The likes of Rizzo Lachinio and Squishy Muffins have all inspired me to become better at the game and maybe one day be as good as them but i am still a long way from doing that. Rocket League has allowed me to meet a variety of different people from a lot of countries and has made playing a lot more fun and interesting. If Psyonix or Rocket League doesn't recieve some sort of reward for best game of 2016 or best sport game of 2016 i'll be severely dissappointed with whichever person or company has decided not to!,Rocket League®
2018-01-18,0,0,34,False,Recommended,Sometimes I sit and think who in their right mind would come up with soccer but with cars? Because that person is a true genius.Rocket League is a game where you play soccer but with cars. Their are even other modes such as basketball ice hockey and much more. You may think that it would get boring but with the games hundreds of thousands of car decals and collectables there really is something to keep you comin. Back for more. When it comes to playing the game there are its pros and it s cons. At a first glance you may think that Rocket League is for everyone ranging from kids to adults but the games cars take lots of time and practice to perfect manouvering the car and especially with the prize pools. Oh lord don t get me started on the prize pools. The game still offers great animations and some base items is you don t want to pay more than you need but it can still cause boredom after a short time.Pros and Cons about Rocket LeaguePros the game offers great animation and new innovative ways to play soccer/sport game has items from other tv shows movies and games to get you interested and make you want to play to get said items game has lost of different cars to chose from depending on playstyle game has hundreds of thousands of car decals for customisations and as a reward for playingCons game has prize pools/crates that cost money for exclusive/rare decals and import cars takes time to get used to controls game has slightly broken matchmaking system (friends and I have experienced bad/unfair matchmaking many times)Rocket League 6.5/10 recommended for patient and experienced gamers,Rocket League®

In my case its one of the most satisfying games I can think of. Only a few things can match how good it feels to win a close match in this game. You can see a clear difference between the different rankings and atleast on ranked you get fairly good matchmaking (unless youre on bronze/silver where you meet a decent ammount of players that play way better than their current rank).

2017-07-27,0,0,50,False,Not Recommended,I definitely have a love hate relationship with Rocket League. This review honestly could have gone either way but I'm gonna play devil's advocate and give it a thumbs down despite my extended play time.The basics of it the concept physics and fast paced gameplay are awesome. There's no game remotely like it. If you measure the merit of a game simply by how many hours you're likely to play then Rocket League is right up there you're likely to get sucked in and play for dozens of hours.But after a certain point it became a negative experience for me. The matchmaking system leaves a lot to be desired. Way too often I found myself in 3v3 matches with expert players who would run circles around me and other players running up the score. It's really not fun when that happens even when the ringer is on my own team. Maybe this is a quaint sentiment but I usually play games to have fun and surmount a reasonable level of challenge not drive myself crazy trying to become a ninja master at them.The community can also be toxic but I guess you ll get that in most MMOs especially when the player base mushrooms. Most players are friendly but a minority are not. If you want to play for hundreds of hours in order to get good that s certainly your prerogative. But if you then criticize your anonymous teammates for not being up to your level it makes you nothing more than an obnoxious a hole. That s not really Psyonix s fault but if I m being honest it still drives me crazy. I wish it didn t but I guess that s just human nature /Anyway maybe matchmaking can be fixed. I don t really know but I d like to see Psyonix at least try to address it.,Rocket League®

2016-04-28,2,1,1198,False,Recommended,I can sum this game up pretty easily with a single word FUN. If that is what you value in a game then read no further and buy this game. In fact buy a 4 pack share it with your friends and let the addiction take hold.Let me tell you a little story You had been eyeballing this game for a while with interest as you d seen some clips of it and it looked fun. But you couldn't get your friends to bite on it so you just kept it on your wishlist potentially waiting for a sale. You didn t have it in your coveted #1 most wanted position because after all who could put a simple indie game about rocket cars playing soccer above some much anticipated AAA release that is coming up. But you had it on there it s bright blue logo lying in stark contrast to the grim blood splattered wasteland that was the rest of your wishlist.Then it happened a Rocket League free weekend popped up when you logged into Steam on an average Thursday night. Sweet a chance to try it out and see if I enjoy it you thought. So you spent the next few nights of your free time playing it and then the weekend arrived. You had a few things to take care of but there was plenty of time to enjoy your new favorite game. You also managed to get one of your friends to try it out and they seem to really enjoy it as well. Since the game had now proven itself worthy of purchase you decided to pick up a 4 pack of the game.A few days had past and the weekend was nearing a close. And while the prospect of Monday was rapidly approaching you knew there wasn t much going on and you could take a sick day without much recourse. But then Tuesday turned into Wednesday turned into jeez you re really sick. It has only been one week since you got that first taste of free Rocket League and you ve already gone from almost respectable member of society to an adrenaline addled junkie who can t sleep and is looking for his next fix. Your responsibilities have been ignored divorce papers have been filed and even your dog is giving you serious looks of concern as the level of food in the feed bin has dwindled. You ve deleted your wishlist as there are no other games now and on top of all that your friends are now starting to show some of the symptoms as well. You ve got to be ready for work tomorrow but instead you re holding your game controller (which you bought to play Rocket League) in your hand crying. All this has happened because you decided to try Rocket League for free on the weekend one time. 10/10 would experience life devastating addiction again.But seriously now I'm not really much of a sports fan and my competitive streak has waned as I have gotten older. I mean I watch a little bit of college football when it is football season but I don't really get into it too much. But playing this game has a transformative effect and will have you shouting on every big goal or clutch defensive block from the moment you make your first big play. When the teams are evenly matched and a round goes into overtime things will get intense palms will get sweaty and friendships will be ended. But that's ok its all part of the process of letting go.When you first start playing the game you are immediately confronted with the fact that you are terrible. You ll whiff just trying to simply connect with the ball on an easy play. You ll get knocked into next week and sent tumbling across the field and unable to make a recovery for 15 seconds as you flail about. You ll plow the ball into your own goal amid cheers of Great pass! and What a save! from the other team. Being a complete disgrace to your team and your country combined with the fact that there is a guy on the opposing team who is flying around spiking the ball into the goal off of your face while eating everything you throw at him for lunch will bother you. But seeing what is possible will have you wanting to improve your game.Because the matches are only 5 minutes long it is ridiculously easy to get swept up in the desire to just play match after match and before you know it several hours have just flown by. The adrenaline rush of clutch plays is just so huge it really will get you pumped and you WILL have problems sleeping until you calm down (confirmed from friends). If you lack the discipline to just put the game down DAYS can easily go by in your quest to become the Kobe Bryant of Rocket League.If you are at all a fan of playing games to have fun do yourself a favor and play this game with some friends. If you don t have any friends you will undoubtedly make some along the way once you bust a few decent moves on the court.Edit 800 hours later can confirm its still life destroying.,Rocket League®

2016-12-24,0,0,83,False,Recommended,After a while of not engaging in fun and enjoyable mulitplayer experiences I finally plucked up the courage to buy this wonderful piece of art. I actually played this game when it was on the 'Free to Play' weekend but then I never came back to it.First of all the game fundamentally replicates the theme of a football (soccer) match which initally sounded awful becuase I really don't like football...or any &lt enter body part&gt ball tbh. But I was so wrong. The standard mode of the game consists of a 3 vs 3 game where you attempt to score goals with a massive weird exploding ball. This is so competitive and fun to play and is more particularly enjoyable when accompanied by friends. We tend to get really in the spirit yelling at other players and eventually finishing with 'gg' regardless of the abusive shouted from both teams whether in text or voice chat. There's some good back and fourth banter going on when this happens (I cringed a bit writing that). Second of all the game consists of not just standard mode but also a RUMBLE MODE. This mode takes the game to a whole new level of enjoyment and laughter. Rumble is a mode which is constructed of the standard mode but then adds different power ups in which the player can uses to their advantage (and if you're me you'll manage to use them to your disadvantage). One of my favourite things about this game is the customisation of your car and the many MANY different flags and toppers that the player can earn after games. The game also includes different takes on different sports like hockey and basket ball but for me personally the fun is in waking one great massive ball at the back of the net.Overall I would reccomend this game if you and your friends are looking for a new game to play which is enjoyable funny and ADDICTING!,Rocket League®

2017-11-25,1,1,751,False,Not Recommended,"One of my longest torments in form of videogames. I should recommend this and would have about a year ago but now I must say this as it is. You feel bad most of the time playing this game. It starts with ""uuuh and aaah""s and you're having fun at the beginning even awesome time when your skills develope and you start to raise in the ranks. It*s those even mathes where it starts to you off. Those games are too often decided with bounces caused by highly questinable physics that you never get used to. Frustration easily begins to ad up.This game is too fast and chaotic for proper tactics that rule in many ball games. Differences with cars are mostly cosmetic so there's not much to go from there either. Cosmetics are most of the time dumb and dull lost potential in my opinion. Chat in this game is full of people (8/10) that can turn happy man into a grim man. Only reasonable thing to do is to swich it off and therefore miss those nice people you would enjoy chatting with.This is not the game for those who play for fun and stress relief. This is a game for those who like to whip themselves and go to bed with sour mood. Play it if you will but be warned.",Rocket League®

Please describe what you liked or disliked about this game and whether you recommend it to others.Please remember to be polite and follow the Rules and Guidelines.Where do I start? Theres no complimentary breakfast which was incredibly disappointing given I bought the Game of the Year edition. The soundtrack is produced by TrashCan who wouldn't know good music if you five starred him with a hand. (REDACTED). Theres too much water. Tiddy . The Magic School Bus isnt in the game and i wanted it. Everytime you score this big ol guy comes outta the hole and dabs so hard my game crashes. this game and the poeople who made it. Its so poorly optimized that if you try to kachow after you score your fps jumps to 800 regardless of what your pc is made of (DIAMOND!!!?????) so frame jump suck. The digging mechanic is weird. Weird side note if you play this game on a mac it breaks completely and all the cars turn in to horsies so you have to fly using their butt rockets. Its SOOO garish. 2/10 wasnt impressed with the new Need for Speed. Try playing Flatout 3 Chaos and Destruction if you want a real womans game,Rocket League®

2015-07-18,0,0,960,False,Recommended,A Legendary Game!I've randomly seen a youtube review about this game and 20 minutes later I bought it because I was so fascinated by this Style of playing Soccer.For 20 this game is a bit expensive because there is only 1 gamemode playing football (soccer) with cars but it's making a lot of fun to play it with friends!So in this game you can unlock a few things you get after you played a match even if you lost! (not anymore). These things you can unlock are just cosplays or cosmetics! So no one who played it for hours has an advantage to anyone playing this first time!So this is from beginning to ending fair!There is one thing i am criticizeing and this are the BOTS. The Bots are so overpowered sothat you havent got a chance to win a game if the enemie has 2 or more BOTS in his team! (not anymore)But for playing with friends its the best game i've played for a long time because it's just like Mario Kart with a Ball sothat there is only shouting in Skype or in your Teamspeak!I think everyone should have played it once!!!This game developed in such a good way..Can't believe this (April 2017),Rocket League®

2017-03-31,0,0,327,False,Recommended,Rocket league has quickly become one of my favourite sports games to date. It has a pretty big learning curve but once you get the hang of how it plays and how the ball reacts to your car you'll have a great time. As with most multiplayer games this game is very enjoyable with friends. With that you'll also have more coordination with your teammates which will lead to more wins thus more fun. The only bad thing I can really think about is how toxic the community can be with chat spammers trash talkers smurfs etc. But most online games will have their fair share of those kinds of players. Rocket League is extremely well polished and plays great with smooth uncapped framerate good graphics great music selection (depending on taste of course) and the game is receiving updates monthly. Rocket League is a great purchase for people looking for a new game experience filled with exciting moments and fresh game mechanics.,Rocket League®

2015-07-08,3,3,65,False,Recommended,OK So you've seen this game featured all over the web it looks kinda quirky and you're not too sure about it. Let me break down some reasons why this game is one of the most fun online experiences available.Think of it as a cross between Demolition Derby and Soccer/Football set in a futuristic enviroment where the cars are loaded with rockets (which require constant refueling) and battle for a massive ball on a caged field/pitch. The game is fast competitive and quickly addictive. Pros Extremely quick load times between games takes between 2 5 secconds. Yes really. Stable fluid online and offline play You share a profile which levels with you and unlocks new cosmetic looks to your cars. Simple controls fully embraces a controller for optimum gaming experience. Simple to learn difficult to master. Beautiful but simple graphics which are beautifully optimized. Online gameplay includes 1v1 2v2 3v3 4v4 and 1v1 2v2 3v3 Ranked. You can party up with up to 4 people local splitscreen up to 4 people (Yes on PC) Quick communication through the d pad seems to avoid nasty online communicationCons As far as I know you can only party up with people on your platform. IE) PC can only invite other steam players. This is a must have a massively fun unique and competitive game that ANYONE can enjoy to the point of ADDICTION!10/10 Will Score On Own Net Again,Rocket League®

2017-09-02,0,0,126,False,Recommended,"Rocket league IS a good game no doubt.At it's best it's a fun fast paced competitive multiplayer experience.At it's worst it's the game of who can get spewed the most insults at from your because you missed a save....which they were responsible for. Although there are plenty of nice encouraging people in Rocket League the cancerous community can be overwhelming at times which would be less overwhelming if the report function would be more responsive. As an example of the toxicity of some of the players just the last match I was playing a 2v2 competitive game at Silver III level. The opposition were the same skill level as eachother however one of them kept on hurling F Bomb's and the typical ""you're a boosted "". The person of which these insults were thrown at wasn't having the best match but still not making stupid mistakes. Some matches if you're down by a few points and there's one minute left and your teammate votes to forfeit but you don't they'll start playing with the other team scoring own goals and blocking your shots. Frustrating.Apart from the community the game while flawed at a few points is a surprisingly fun experience. Who would've thought that playing football/soccer with RC cars would be so fun?The graphics are flashy and fun. There are plenty of cool lighting effects. They aren't too distracting (provided you've turned motion blur and weather effects off) for a multiplayer competitive game and they set a good tone.The gameplay itself doesn't get stale and is essentially flawless. Easy to learn hard to master. That kind of stuff. Impressive moves are extremely satisfying to pull off.The soundtrack is nothing short of a masterpiece for ears fine tuned to EDM. Although most of the tracks are not songs which you would've heard before they're still fantastic. In a *fairly* recent update they've added a song from the soundtrack to be played once a goal is scored or an ""epic save"" is made. Overall it's very fitting.Communication between teammates is simple and intuitive. It would be nicer if you could add custom emotes however I guess there's a reason why you can't.....The devs are very faithful and still giving a constant stream of updates 2 years in and listening to what people want. My only gripe is that some of the updates do not quite accomplish this such as the Chaos Run update (where they added 2 cars no one plays with the Ripper and the Grog and a map that no one likes Wasteland). They do make up for this however with some amazing new gamemodes such as Hoops and Dropshot and new customizability options. A nice segway for....Customizability. The battle cars aren't affected by the customizability options apart from car body so it's nice to decorate without worrying about stats. There are plenty of customizability options and extremely cool black market animated decals. Although I own none personally I hope to trade up to one eventually.So what's the verdict?It's a fun experience I'll probably be playing for quite a while longer. Although the community is quite a bit toxic and devs can make some weird choices at times it's one of my favorite games.",Rocket League®

2017-02-23,0,0,1007,False,Recommended,"I love this game! I purchased it twice now once on the ps4 and then when I purchased a gaming PC I bought it again on Steam. The game is easy to learn and love but hard to master. Between the two systems I have over 200 hours of play time and can't wait for more. For someone that has never tried the game the concept is simple. You play 5 minute soccer matches with rocket powered RC cars. That's it! It sounds so simple that you'd think it would be boring. It is FAR from boring!!! There are a million different ways to score and defend. The quick chat is usually very positive with the team celebrating your success as long as you do it in return. There is the occassional rude user that spams ""what a save!"" when you wiff on a save but just brush it off and leave after the game.I use a PS4 dual shock controller most of the time and works great! A CONTROLLER IS A MUST! playing with keyboard and mouse is no where near as fun.In some of the reviews I notice folks complain about having to pay for some of the unlocks. My justification is that I've been playing since it launched on the PS4 and the developers have been really responsive when the server fails or balancing isn't fair. That continued development costs the company more than the $20 it is to purchase the game. Let them charge $2 for cars that were not available at launch. The crate system for some of the crazy skins and mods frustrates me some. I work really hard in hopes of getting a crate then when I get one I have to buy keys to open the crate and I risk getting a lame skin I already own. When you get something cool though it feels amazing! Overall I recommend you buy the game. The game is designed as such that the paid unlocks only make you look cool and by no means give you an advantage. Give the game a shot!",Rocket League®

2018-01-12,0,0,1555,False,Recommended,My favorite game I have about 1500 hours cross console and 850 at the moment on steam I really love this game and the community I highly reccomend anyone who likes quick games that can either be extremely wacky and funny or very competitive.Though I do reccomend a good computer to run it on good settings because on low settings which gives the best fps but it looks very pixelated but you can get used to it.There is also a great and big community growing rapidly there are many teams that have fun together or play in tournaments and this game can be very fun with your friends in modes like Dropshot Chaos or Lab and even competitive modes like Doubles Standard (3v3) Solo Standard (3v3 with only solo queue) and Solo (1v1).If you are making a decision to buy this game or not I would give you the thumbs up but there are many Youtube videos showing you the pros and cons of rocketleague. One pro would be the price it is extremely cheap compared to the standard $60 per game. A con would be some of the toxic people in the community which can sometimes throw competitive games and say bad things to you. There are many pros and cons though so do your research.Thanks for reading this long and boring review.,Rocket League®

2018-04-27,0,0,1277,False,Recommended,I consider this an addiction... I have other games in my library gifted and purchased I am yet to play because I enjoy this so much. This game ticks many boxes if you only have 20 minutes free you can jump in and play three solid matches. It matches you against similarly skilled players as you go up and down in ability I tend to rank down a bit after a drink or if I'm tired and go back up when I'm concentrating and the matchmaking does a great job of pairing me with similar players so I never feel like I'm overly outgunned by others.There is a really satisfying progression aspect to it as you learn new things and how to anticipate your teammates moves and others attacks etc. I only play 2v2 ranked this is the sweet spot for me. If you're new jump into unranked for a while to skill up I'd say 3v3 then 2v2 avoid 1v1 unless you want to get really annoyed then go to 2v2 ranked. I'll never be a kuxir or squishymuffinz (pro players) however I do enjoy it. 1 065 hours in so far... worryingly high amount of time to spend on a single game...!Great job Psyonix.,Rocket League®

2017-03-22,0,0,1915,False,Recommended,Ever since I saw gameplay I knew this had to be mine. So I went to the Steam store and bought it straight away. Ever since I started playing I have never thought about stopping. I would always purchase new games that I seemed interested in yet after a day or two I would always venture back to Rocket League even after it's release back in the middle of 2015. That say's something. The concept of the game is incredibly easy hit the ball into the goal but... the amount of skill it takes to master this game even the professionals who have been playing Rocket League and it's prequel SARPBC for over 6 years still haven't fully grappled every corner of this game. This is what gives Rocket League it's longevity and the developers know that which is why there is no plan for a second sequel of this style of game. 10/10 game I've loved it ever since I started playing. I'll hit Grand Champion one day!,Rocket League®

2016-03-24,0,0,943,False,Recommended,"Amazing game kept me addicted even when I've bought other games as well.From the gameplay aspect it feels very realistic. Has much physics embedded inside this simple game. Graphics are nice albeit being playable even with the worst graphics possible.It takes a little bit of effort in the first hours as you get used to positioning but once you handle it you're ready to go and explore other skills.DLCs are quite great everyone may have their own preferences when it comes to choosing cars. Luckily this ain't ""pay to play"" games so people using DLC cars isn't necesarrily better (unless they're used to it and very good in using it).There are microtransactions and trading (either with other players or trading in items for a higher quality item you'll understand once you buy it.) inside this game but it's not disturbing or anything bad. I may also say that this is a quite profitable game if you use the trading system and understand it well. (sometimes needs luck but hey everyone has that)Recommended whether or not you like soccer and cars short length of matches and unique concept makes it a great game for everyone.11/10 would keep avoiding and muting toxic salty players )",Rocket League®

2016-06-23,1,1,108,False,Recommended,"Sometimes the simplest ideas are the best ideas. ROCKET LEAGUE GAMEPLAY Take asSOCCiation football (SOCCer). The game where you kick a ball into a net. Now take a car. The thing that you drive to get around. Attach a rocket to it. The thing we used to get to the moon. Now mash these two things together. Sounds stupid right? Nope. Rocket League is so simple that anyone can ""get it"" in their first try playing the game yet just complicated enough to reward skill and have replayability. The maps are pretty much the same aside from size though the new Neo Tokyo map hoops and Rocket Labs changes them up enough. Different modes such as hockey and basketball mutators that let you play with unlimited boost gravity etc. Cars have a good weight and feel to them good turning radius the boost has a good feel to it the controls are slick with both kb+m and controller it's great. GRAPHICS Beautiful. The graphics have a nice little charm to them there's lots of subtle details texture types particles while keeping a steady art style and remaining well optimized. SOUNDTRACK I mean soundtrack's good? Really good. I would have personally preferred if they had gone with synthwave (the concept of rocket powered cars and the aesthetic just screams 80's to me) but the soundtrack they chose is good. Consistent themes catchy tunes good. CONCLUSION I always thought sports games were kiinda stupid. Unless you did something really different like NBA Jam or Wii Sports or any racing game you could think of they were pretty much all the same thing. Rocket League is not the same thing obviously. Taking roots from soccer and racing games the gameplay is simplistic enough for even a toddler while competitive enough to be a professional esport.",Rocket League®

2017-08-04,1,2,269,False,Not Recommended,Rocket league is a good game for competitive players. Not so much for casual. I used to like it for what it was but the game is now more about the items. Pretty much every item in the game is cosmetic with the exception of import bodies as they have different sizes of hitboxes. There are a lot of toxic players (suggesting that the game is mostly played by kids) and it gets boring after a while. It's literally just football/soccer with rocket cars. As the game has always been it's overhyped and boring. Now I'm not saying rocket league is a horrible game but the concept itself just gets boring after a while. Overall I would not recoommend playing the game.,Rocket League®

And I nearly do. Everything from the first game has been improved up on but unfortunately Rocket League is unplayable. Lag and rubber banding in every single online match I have played makes it impossible to play which is why I cannot recommend Rocket League as it stands.Edit 18/07/15 Servers seem to of durastically improved no longer are matches unplayable due to rubber banding.

Matches are short and quick and it's really easy to find yourself playing several in a row. Plenty of parts to unlock and customize your vehicle with and yes there are hats in this game.

But unfortunately it's overshadowed by one problem and it's a big one. The matchmaking. What were the Devs thinking of? If you just bought the game you will be put into a match full of veterens and those veterens will run up the scoreline like Germany did against Brazil. It makes it pretty much unplayable.

2016-08-13,0,0,376,False,Recommended,The Napoleonic Wars (1803 1815) were a series of major global conflicts pitting the French Empire led by Napoleon I against an array of European powers formed into various coalitions. They revolutionised European armies and played out on an unprecedented scale mainly owing to the application of modern mass conscription. The wars were a continuation of the Revolutionary Wars which broke out in 1792 during the French Revolution. Initially French power rose quickly as the armies of Napoleon conquered much of Europe. In his military career Napoleon fought about 60 battles and lost seven mostly at the end of his reign. 22 The great French dominion collapsed rapidly after the disastrous invasion of Russia in 1812. Napoleon was defeated in 1814 and sent into exile on the island of Elba he then escaped and returned to power only to be defeated at the Battle of Waterloo and was exiled again this time to Saint Helena.,Rocket League®

I would recommend to anyone that wants a unique fun game to play with friends.",Rocket League®
2016-12-12,0,0,1926,False,Recommended,Rocket League is a football based game where you are in rocket powered cars there are two teams orange team and blue team. The main objective of the game is to score more goals then your opponents in the five minute time frame. I've only played around 450 hours of this game but I have to say it is one of my favourite games I have ever played I highly recomend it to anyone who likes video games or likes playing football (this game is quite big if you don't have a decent quality computer it is a lot less enjoyable).,Rocket League®

2015-08-06,0,0,587,False,Recommended,Rocket League is a very fun game that can easily be picked up by anyone who plays soccer/football but also people who does not like it. A game that is a sports equivalent of CS GO with very competitive gameplay that requires knowledge and experience to play to it's fullest.A game about flying cars empowered with rockets to score goals can only be fun right? A very unique experience.I believe RL (Rocket League) is a fantastic pickup and can be played for hours and hours. The only problem I've had is server issues in which I've been forced to play many ranked games alone as a result of the server not picking up my teammate. Otherwise Rocket League is an amazing game that I see no reason not to buy.,Rocket League®

2016-12-16,0,0,624,False,Recommended,This is one of those games which look very boring. But once you try playing you just can't stop.At the start it's a challenge to hit the ball. As you progress you learn not only to hit the ball but also to hit it into the right direction. At this point it is very important not to only play solo duel because at this point you have to learn to be cooperative to play any other gamemode. Later on you learn to hit the ball in the middle of the air and then you know pretty much all there is and can try amazingly cool stunts which you can find all over youtube.Be warned though. To get to this point you will most likely need to spend about 150 hours with this game.P.S. Mostly only playable with a controller so either get one or don't get this game. Keyboard controll is possible but it's much better with controller.,Rocket League®

2015-10-26,0,0,81,False,Recommended,I feelt that I should review this game after playing for 23 hours I AM ADDICTED!. If you look at other reviews it says theirs a server problem I have never had in issue and I have wired ethernet. You probably just have a bad wifi provider. Secondly everything about this game is addicting although theirs not a lot of modes. I have heard alot of people saying that having the items not make your car better is bad. I think its good because newbs won't get crushed by people who have all the items. The gameplay is solid although I wouldn't recomend using a controller for accurate gameplay. The graphics are solid and caping the fps at 60 was a nice touch. Even on high settings my game has never lagged even if I drop to 30 fps. What they mean by an easy to learn hard to master means that you can't play 1 hour and be able to always win. I thought I was good until people started using rocket flying more frequently. Overall their looking to add new content and more dlc and have a lot of cool features already implemented so I rate this 10/1O,Rocket League®

2015-08-26,0,0,53,False,Recommended,This game was brought to my attention at Quakecon this year. Everybody was playing it instead of the usual deathmatch arena games. I had no idea it even existed I was highly interested and it looked incredibly competitive. It's a very interesting idea and it works beautifully with the fluidity of the physics exploitation. It is incredibly fun and every match is different. Some people can maneuver their vehicles to make some amazing shots. The only thing I have to say negative about Rocket League and it isn't even a negative is that you won't enjoy it as much if you don't play with friends. I haven't played it much more because I don't find random matches all that appealing.Great game though it has a lot to offer and you'll get more enjoyment than you paid for.,Rocket League®

2018-04-01,0,0,534,False,Not Recommended,Awful Toxic Community. Dodgy Match making. Smurfing beyond belief. I love the core of this game but there are a few major things that let it down.As a title that is rated PEGI 3 the type of language harassment and abuse you see in nearly every match is awful. I know friends and colleagues that play this game with their kids who have inevitably had to turn the text chat off to get away from this. As simple as this is to overcome it shouldn't really need to be done as the text chat is a vital part of playing RL.I only really play ranked RL these days (other than the occasional game of rumble) mainly because of the awfully dodgy matchmaking when searching in Casual. The match making system when searching for casual games seems to match you completely out of your skill level. Not only does it match you out of your skill bracket but it also chooses to match you into games that are already 5 0 down. Now this comes into an entirely different problem of people rage quiting after just conceding a goal(s) where maybe some form of penalty system (like in ranked) may benefit.Because i've only really played ranked rocket league for the last 6 12 months i've been exposed to how common smurfing really is even in ranked matches platinum and above. Things like this just ruin the competitive nature of the game for those who actual enjoy playing.,Rocket League®

2017-08-08,0,0,489,False,Not Recommended,Auto Ban for 24 hours for language?! I took a day off of this game anyways due to some incredibly toxic and own goaling teammates in ranked and I come back slapped with a ban for my language?? Absolutely fantastic. Don't want to scare away those kids who spend their parents money on your lottery system with some foul language ohhh noo. Use the mute function if you don't like how I talk don't completely shut me out of playing the game. That makes absolutely no sense! That's why I enjoyed playing on the PC over my xbox I used to play on (with over 500 hours on that alone) I was able to voice my frustrations without being censored for no reason. It's just more censorship on the internet because heaven forbid someone gets offended by words that a completely anonymous person typed out to them.If you wanna start banning people maybe put a system in place that recognizes when someone own goals more than 3 times in a match so I don't have to play with self hating narcisistic kids when I actually want to play a ranked game. I mean I would be more than happy to play unranked but I can't remember the last time I played that without my entire team/the opposing team quitting after they get scored on once. Please Psyonix. You have a great game here but your eye is quite literally not on the ball. Take care of what matters before your community destroys itself.,Rocket League®

2015-08-17,0,0,2200,False,Recommended,This game is amazing. Simple sleek competitive hours of fun await you in this Fifa meets Mario Cart hybrid. This game is destine to be a major e sport player for years to come. The game play is simple yet refined and there is an even playing field for all players. No unlocks in this game give you an advantage over any of the other players. In theory you could launch into the game out of the box and beat the world s top player in your first match. You won't. You'll lose. But the beauty in this game is that everyone has a fair chance. After a few hours of playtime you will start to figure out how to use the game's flight mechanics to start scoring dazzling aerial goals.The only open issue with this game out of the box is a small glitch that affects players using a mouse and keyboard. This is easily fixed by following the instructions set out in this video I made. Enjoy and I'll see you out on the pitch!,Rocket League®

The one that plays defence no matter how far into that goal the ball is. The guy who steals every goal no matter how hard you worked for that The one who lags all the time and usually ends up driving on the walls of the stadium. And you the guy who sets up and makes goals. My friend and I have spent hours (maybe even days) on this game and you work so hard at achieveing nothing just to have that one moment where you think you are going to make the most pro goal in all of Rocket League history. Then it is ruined by that guy who stole your ing boost and messed with the ball to make the shot miss. You become an alcoholic shortly after yelling at your teammate.

I have been playing this game for more than 700 hours now got to decent rank(superstar) and in my opinion this game has one of the most toxic communities similar to LOL DOTA CS GO Rust etc. It would really help if devs make a good reporting system or some solution to this issue but for now you can only play in stack with your friends to avoid toxic players on your team. I played 3 games in a row with a guy who was not the best player of all but expected me to carry him and ruined 2 out of 3 games intentionally. It is really easy to smurf in this game. I made an experiment myself started playing on my friends acc at the end of the season and found out that on Challenger 2 are actually smurfs in 50% of the games(in opposing teams). This is just harsh for new players they can't really relax playing this game when in a lot of games they face people 6 ranks higher than they are. On high ranks on other hand there are a lot of toxic and boosted people. Some even say that they are boosted some just leave ""pro"" status on them and run like potato in circles chasing the ball. What are the incentives for those players you might ask. End season rewards and big **** to show their friends. Hats off to the devs they countered the smurfs somehow with the matchmaking in parties based on the highest rank but that's also not enough and also affects some legit parties of friends different rank who want to play together. You actually need to carry your friend if your ranks are significantly different.To conclude this game has serious matchmaking issues which is really bad for healthy environment in community. Other things such as gameplay customization different game modes are awesome but they are offset by a terrible issues listed above. I understand that it is really hard to fix smurfing and toxicity but devs haven't done a thing since launch about it.

It's remote controlled cars with aerial abilities and football (+ hockey basketball and a variety of experimental areanas) combined to create an addictive multiplayer experience. On the surface it looks silly but you really have to play it to understand what all the fuss is about great gameplay experience with an energetic atmosphere that requires skill to pull off some amazing goals and is even more fun with friends. Controls are solid and performance is buttery smooth to boot. Cars are customisable with new bodies decals paintwork toppers (hats etc.) and antenas. New content such as game modes are added to the game for free however you can pay a little more for some extra customisational options (though do note that these are completely aesthetic no stat boosts of any kind).Highly recommended to those who want to try something different.

2018-02-19,0,0,310,False,Not Recommended,"TLDR What once was a fun casual party game has been shaped by its ranked community and Psyonix into a highly competitive game all about eSports crates ranks and wins. Sadly this isn't the game I originally bought 3 years ago and I can't recommend it to non competitive gamers in good faith anymore unless you REALLY know what you're buying.If you're reading this you most likely know what Rocket League is. You know the game where you hit a large ball around with your rocket powered car in an over the top fantasy equivalent of Test Drive Eve of Destruction's 'Soccer' mode. Overall there's nothing like it and it's pretty good too.So why the thumbs down in spite of 300+ hours of playtime? Well first of all as of writing this I haven't even touched the game in over 5 months. Deep down I still enjoy the concept of Rocket League so much that I can't outright hate the game itself and I wish I still could enjoy it like I used to. That being said my main problem with Rocket League nowadays and the reason I'm writing this is the direction the game and its community have taken since launch.When Rocket League originally came out in 2015 it was just a simple fun soccer game. Hop on play some matches ignore anyone that took the game too seriously customize your car grab some new items here and there through sporadic post match item drops stuff like that. There were even DLC packs that you could buy and get a couple cars with some items. I liked that and I would buy them to show how much I liked the game even the ones I wasn't crazy about. $4 for 2 cars and some items released alongside new free maps? What a steal.Then the crates happened late 2016 and everything went downhill from there. Psyonix stated that some proceeds from key sales would go towards funding eSports prize pools which to me was kinda weird back then. Now I think it's just absurd. Asking your playerbase to pay for your eSports tournaments' prize pools is bad enough in my opinion but doing it through psuedo gambling cosmetic crates by exploiting people's gambling addictions whether you consider these crates to be gambling or not is just wrong. Those new cars that looked super cool? You have to gamble for them now you can't just buy them outright anymore and free Decryptor keys don't count they just enable people to buy more keys. The exceptions to this are the licensed DLCs which while still cool comes off as having your cake and eating it too which isn't that great a business strategy for an indie studio to be partaking in at all.By the way I know there's a subset of the community that will tell people like me that oppose the crate system to just buy some keys and start trading with people. Sadly Rocket League makes doing that overcomplicated. I have bad anxiety problems I can't randomly add people to trade stuff because my uneasiness from even typing this review just won't allow it. Also even in that subset there's scammers you have to look out for. If only Psyonix actually cared and either integrated Steam Marketplace to let people resell/trade that way or make an in game trading marketplace feature maybe I would buy some keys and support the game that way but since trading doesn't directly benefit Psyonix they naturally buried that idea before it was ever considered.The final straw for me was when the community backlash to Neo Tokyo caused Psyonix to create a flat standardized layout for it. Then came Wasteland and Starbase Arc. Does the ground slightly curve on the sides? Better flatten it to make our toxic community happy they're apparently completely incapable of adapting and adjusting to different scenarios to overcome their opposition and need Psyonix to ""fix"" the game for them. This also made the eSports competitions themselves completely unwatchable for me. Why would I watch people play a computer game where all of the maps are the same and no different strategies are required? I'd rather watch the Overwatch League.Speaking of toxic good grief this game is REALLY toxic. I remember joining a match a ball flies past me before I even have control of my car and my teammate calls me slow in text chat and starts berating me until he rage quits. I'm not the type of person to get offended by it but seriously dude? Saying I'm mentally crippled over a video game? How about you lighten up and stop taking casual play so seriously? (The kicker was that we started scoring the moment he quit so the joke's on him and yes this was in CASUAL not ranked I've never been that competitive a gamer to invest any serious time into ranked and I have my reasons.) This game and Overwatch seem to be the biggest offenders of this (if you don't count MOBAs and every multiplayer survival game of course) and frankly it just makes me sad. Again I have bad social anxiety problems as it is and all this kind of behavior makes me want to do is just stop playing entirely. Is that what this community really wants for people to just leave and never come back due to the sheer toxicity of its casual playerbase?This is going to sound unrelated but I swear I'm bringing this up for a reason. I had a friend for years while I was growing up. Generally he was one of those that I felt had my back if I needed help yeah he would make some edgy jokes once in a while but nothing that was unbearable. Flash forward nearly a decade after I met him and the last time we talked he was constantly dragging everyone down using racial slurs every night and feeding off of any sort of happiness he could wring out of us. I called him out one time and he didn't want to hear any of it and guilt tripped me into apologizing. A few months after that I had to just stop talking to him entirely because I just couldn't take the toxicity anymore it was making me miserable.Guess what his favorite game was? Rocket League. He hated it at first like most newer games where he would just quit without trying to learn anything but then he saw me starting it up and I grabbed him a copy. We had some fun matches but even from day one if a goal got past he got agitated real quick blaming his own teammates for the other team scoring even if we did everything he wanted us to and this would happen every night we played games with him because all he wanted to play was Rocket League all the time hence the 300+ hours. Eventually he decided he could only play VS AI with me that we would never be good enough for even casual online play. It was probably for the best honestly because even in those few online matches we did play if someone on the enemy team said something negative to us there he was with the racial slurs it was embarrassing. I wouldn't be surprised if he got banned from the online now.My point is these days I like to think of Rocket League and that friend as one and the same. I hope deep down that something will change that maybe Psyonix will make a PURE CASUAL playlist put all the fun other modes in there (Dropshot Hockey Rumble) with the original non standardized maps add a trading marketplace in game just...something other than tournaments. Tournaments that only really cater to the competitive side of the community the ones that value wins and numbers over just having fun with the game in the first place. I'm not judging anyone that plays games this way (hey more power to you) but I read the YouTube comments on said Tournaments teaser video and I see this gem ""If you're not hyped then you're not a real fan."" 238 upvotes as of me writing this. Nope guess I don't hate myself enough to be a 'real fan.'Hopefully my former friend can get his act together and become a better person but I doubt it. Same with Rocket League sadly. It was a lot of fun while it lasted but the toxicity has gotten to me and it's just not the same now. To those that still enjoy the game please keep enjoying it. It's not a bad game it's just not what I want anymore.",Rocket League®

2016-05-22,0,0,8,False,Recommended,"I know this review is quite late but I only got the game three days ago. I've played probably about 60 matches about 55 of which were all in the online competitive ranked mode. And the game is great. It's a fast paced mashup of soccer and a car combat game. Not much to talk about there. It takes a surprising amount of skill and spatial awareness to play well.But what I will mention is the terrible community this game has. I bought this game three days ago and only played more than an hour the past day and a half. About half the players I've played have been fine no issue. The other half of them however will do annoying things like saying "" you"" at the end of a match they lost or ""bullcrap"" in reaction to one of your goals. They'll claim something was lucky even if you did it on purpose. This is 1v1 btw. In 3v3 the pug 3v3 people spam emotes and leave after a 2 goal deficit.Or another time a player yelled ""GET VAC BANNED."" I scored like 3 goals and he had 8. I play a ton of sports games. I've never cheated in my life in a multiplayer video game. And I truthfully only bought this game so I could have something to do while I wait for Overwatch to be released. Not to say this game is just going to be something I leave behind afterwards I do love this game. But the idea that I would cheat is just absurd I'm not THAT invested in the game at this early on. I recommend buying the game if you like a really fast paced actiony sports game. It's faster than any sports like game I've ever played. I didn't try the hoops mode yet but it seems cool. But the toxic community is unfortunately here just like it is in every online game.",Rocket League®
2016-06-09,1,2,498,False,Recommended,"53 hours and counting... at first I thought it would stop at like five or six hours because ""for how long can this be fun?!"". Well considering how short the matches are (five minutes) and how fast paced they are it's one of those ""pick up and play one or two games just to kill some time"" games.W... what? What this game is all about? Well. You're driving rocket cars with which you're playing football/soccer (depending on where you're from) and there's also game modes to play hockey basketball and such. If you're mostly into football (hey I'm from Europe we say it the right way!) then you can play that 3v3 2v2 and 1v1. You've got training modes to make you better at the game. I probably have missed som oh yeah one of the biggest features of the game.Customizing your car. What can you do with the car? Great question! There's the body decals the colors of the body and decals wheels flames (for when you're using boost) different hats and also different things to put on your antenna. So pretty extensive all things considered. More is also being added as the times goes on.Such a great little game I wholeheartedly do recommend this game.

In fact it is so bad that i wouldn't even put it in the category ""community""...I tried League Of Legends back in the day... Man was that a salty community filled to the brim with small boys who all apparently had sex with your mom...LoL salt is ing sugar canes up your compared to Rocket League's community... Never have i seen so much salt uncalled for trash talk and a terrible misuse of the given ""quick commands"" for the chat. The intention of the command ""What a save"" was meant for a pat on your shoulder if you did something amazing to keep the ball out of your team's net. However this ""quick chat command"" is NEVER ever ever used as a compliment. Rather it is used to redicule accidents and ""bad"" goalkeeping. Ofcourse this would happen and it does happen in most other similar games.. But the kids playing this game are derived directly from the devil himself.I mean the following in the most sincere honest way humanly possible 99% of all people playing Rocket League deserves to die. As in literally fall dead to the ground. Have weird sick happen to their families and get whiped from the face of the earth. These people are bad people. To the core. Rocket League behavior should be information brought to job interviews and first dates. These people deserve to die alone. Without ever feeling the love of a woman/man. They need to be eradicated.I'm not usually a ""mean"" or ""evil"" person. I make friends with most people I come across. But I will never.

I think I achieved it somewhat I put the israel flag and my skin was a bunch of skulls painted blue and white It had devil horns on to represent Israel's malevolence in the gaza strip situation. The trail of the vehicle was a trail of money it represents the amount of money the United States gives to Israel. I felt very limited trying to express this sophisticated joke. There is limits on the colors you can use.Sometimes the colors are perfect in one team and then in the other team the colors are all people say you need a controller to play this i use a keyboard to play this so i wouldnt knowI still suck at this game i still can't pull off the tricks where you boost into the air and hit the ball in the middle of the air some people are really good at this they must be nerds. No. Sometimes I feel that im just playing with bots in this game the guys dont even type slurs in the chat they just use the standard game responses. They are artificial intelligence slowly learning to play through machine learning tricks thats how they end up doing these impossible tricks some AI's are really behind especially the ones that become members of my team the teams i get to be in suck I am just a flower about to bloom but i never bloom because my team sucks hard and they hold me back in how much i can achieve feels like real life.this game is ok i always have internet problems when i play so i just end up quitting i always have latency in this ing thingThere is also a flag of NeoGaf in this game and this offends me some of the moderators in that website are into illegal pornography and my heart darkens when i play this game and i remember that. child pornography is bad.,Rocket League®

Its not 2016 anymore the game is dead glitchy and broken in some ways and the community is toxic not on a cs go or any battle royale game level of toxic but still bad but thank goodness no one uses the voice chat.If for some reason you may still be interested in this game I would recommend a controller because it took me a good 70 hours to just get used to keyboard controls and I'm still bad at the game even after 150 hours total across my pc and switch. I wouldnt recommend the game just because of how psyonix doesnt fix any of the issues above. InsteadThey added the rocket pass!!!!1!!!11!EDIT According to other reviews they removed casual dropshot hoops (basketball) snow day (ice hockey) and rumble (powerups). This has to be the most update I've heard of yet. Not only did they remove gamemodes that casual players may enjoy more than the base game they made them compettitive so that tryhards would ruin the game for them. Honestly if Psyonix decides to make another game I wouldn't buy it because once they make a good game they have to ruin it with bad updates bad server maintenence and greedy desicions. I'd think of myself as a pretty negative thinker to be honest but there is no way that anyone should have the right to think of this game in a positive way anymore. If you've seen a positive review on this game it's likely from wither 2015/16 when the game was actually good or it's from a die hard fan who will deny any proof that the game has gone downhill.Also for some strange reason the devs can't decide between DLC Loot Boxes that give you no chance to get something you could actually use without buying another hundred of them and the new rocket pass that everyone loves so very much.CS GO is cheaper and VALVe cares about that game more than Psyonix does with this one.,Rocket League®

It's just really creative and fun and if you get good you'll do some tricks that will make your endorphins light like candles. But it needs some changes or upgrades to it's report system. I've never heard of anyone getting punished for stupid in this game or serious stuff for that matter. Your options are to report harrasment or afk'ing or just unsportsman like conduct. But it's allmost impossible to check if someone trolled for an entire match. Like i said the game is very fun! And i belive the comunity is great but only if you get past the prospect riseing star div1 players. i just uinstalled the game after i played a 3v3 match. 2 of the people on the enemy team left very early but we kwpt playing 3v1 which isn't fair but i didnt want to risk the match as i was at promotion. half way into the match one on my team starts playing against us. And since we aren't prepeard for that he scores. We thought he just messed up and kept playing but then he scored again and made it an even score. Finally he give the guy the last goal just before over time and we lose a match 3v1 couse of a troll i can't prove did it since i can't send my replays to psyonix and i dont usually run a capture software in the backround. I think the game is fun if you focus on it casually and dont play ranked. But it'll also be fun if you are confident you could get past the challenger ranks where all the trolls and youtube fakers seem to hang out.i hope they do something about this but until then this game just makes me frustrated.

2016-02-10,0,0,178,False,Recommended,Rocket League stole my heart and sometimes that's not a good thing. There is a lot of praise about Rocket League already so I'm just going to present some things which I found to be slightly faulty. In the interest of your time should you be reading this the bottomline is that I loved it but it certainly isn't perfect.I'm not a competitive player so losing very often isn't something I have fun with. Before the most recent patch there was no way to text mute filter or even report players. This would often cause me personally a lot of frustration as this seems to be the kind of game that really invites a good deal of negative offensive or just otherwise unsportsmanlike players. I know the rebuttal to this is that I need thicker skin or that it's just Internet being the Internet but my point is that I shouldn't be forced to put up with it. This has been fixed with the recent additions to the chat options however so I am very thankful for that.Beyond that the matchmaking system sometimes feels a little too unfair. Often teams which are already technically the underdog (through level or multiple losses) will be ignored by the matchmaking and be used as bottomfeed.In one particular scenario when I was at the pro level I was matched with another pro and the matchmaking assigned another bot to our team. We were up against two veterans and an expert. After we lost the opposing team's expert left and the matchmaking sought two new players to join for the rematch. Curiously it took me to their team and left the other pro player alone with two bots after not finding a new player. Obviously the lone pro player was slaughtered for two minutes before a bunch of players were brought in saw the losing battle and promptly left anyway.Ideally the matchmaking would take one of the veterans and match each with either pro in my team to balance both squads. I realize level isn't exactly indicative of player skill but if the game wasn't going to take level into consideration regarding the player's skill level then giving players a title would be irrelevant to begin with.This has happened to me on many occasions.Players leaving mid match is very problematic as well as the ability to do so incentivizes a big deal of players to not stick around unless they're already winning. Losing players halfway through a match can and often is decisive. Players should be penalized for leaving. Worst even as I've mentioned it's very common for players to not want to stick around in a surely losing match. Once two players leave and start losing by two or three goals it's extremely difficult (at least in my experience) for other players to stick around so the remaining player might as well just forfeit.This is not even in question in my mind Allowing players to just leave is absolutely the wrong design decision here.Regardless of these issues which in my opinion are not small issues but ones that I hope will fixed sometime soon Rocket League was in my Top 5 Videogames of 2015. I don't see myself stopping in the near future. The mix of moment to moment team tactics with extremely high skill ceiling and addicting mechanics focused on mastery over the physics engine is brilliant and I have no doubt this will become a very popular videogame in eSports or other videogame competitions. The design lends itself to very very high levels of play with fantastic moves and the capacity for a degree of mastery the likes of which we usually only see in the fighting game community.Rocket League is amazing. Even if it breaks my heart sometimes.,Rocket League®

2016-11-24,1,2,1214,False,Recommended,So i think i got enough hours to sum up a review for this game. It's not gonna be long though you really can't write much about a game thats well done.For me the most important thing a game should have is an easy gameplay cause there are a lot of games that are overall good but their gameplay is grievous. It is really easy to understand the basic mechanics and how the game runs and it is quite hard to fully master them which makes the game an excellent competitive pursuit. This is one of the games which can be played with people with older less powerfull PC's like myself. At almost minimum reqs. i have no problem running the game at 40 50 FPS which is more than enough. Of course the graphics won't be as good but if you aren't pretentious this won't be a problem. There are some problems though which i will state down in the review..The cars and their designs are really good. There is a car for anybody no matter if you like playing with race cars or big monster trucks you will find your suitable car. All cars have unique decals and paintjobs and with all the variety of toppers anthenas and wheels you can customise your car whatever the way you like. Wide variety of in game mods hoops hockey rl labs mutators etc. The maps in the normal and ranked playlist are really cool made all of them maybe excluding Neo Tokyo which in my opinion belongs in the labs playlist due to it's terrain. The main menu is very clear no unnecessary options and decorations. You have easy access to anything from the matchmaking to the options. The bad things First one is the really weird FPS drop on the Aqua Dome map. From 40 50 normal FPS it drops to 15 and it is not playable at all. Keep in mind that this is a problem that is only on less powerful PC's like mine so if you got a new powerful PC you will have no problem here. Still i hope the devs will do something to make it playable for us.The second and last con for me is the random matchmaking at times which is a bit annoying in competitive play although it's much better since last year. So finally if you think of buying this game my opinion is go for it this game deserves its price.8/10.,Rocket League®

2016-11-25,0,0,66,False,Recommended,This game is a ing sensation. Every once in a while someone comes up with a stupid concept for a game that against all odds turns out to be absolutely amazing. The concept for Rocket League is Monster Trucks/Cars with rockets charge after a gigantic ball in a game of football. The basic controls are simple enough drive car into ball to score goal pick up boost and use charge to gain speed or to fly through the air. Still it takes a lot of time to master your vehicle properly to get a good feel of the game and not least how to cooperate with your team. When the feeling of mastery hits you there's no escaping this pleasure machine. This game is simply the good Video game smack. The feel of nailing an Aerial or magically blocking your friends from one. There's not one single game on this planet that's more fun to play with your friends right now.,Rocket League®

2016-06-10,0,0,656,False,Recommended,Premise Take 3v3 5 minute soccer and replace the players with rocket powered cars. It may sound crazy but it s a formula for a great time. The developers have continued to support the game long after launch enabling cross platform play across PS4 and Xbox One as well as adding more sports! Hockey? Check! Basketball? Check!! Custom game modes from beach balls to giant boulders? Check!!Visuals The arenas all look and feel fantastic making you feel like you re actually on the pitch steering your car towards victory. The vehicles all look unique though they all have the same stats. The game also offers quite a bit of customization with myriad cars toppers wheels and antennae to choose from (even more with the purchase of very reasonably priced DLC). They have an update scheduled for the end of this month that s going to expand the items even further with increasingly rare items and even stat tracking ones (think strange items from Team Fortress 2). Sound The stadiums come alive with chants and cheers ooh s and ahh s. The soundtrack is killer though there s no option to listen to the music while in a game strangely enough. The cars all make different noises with the trails having their own unique sounds as well. Overall I m really impressed by how it all comes together. I can tell by sound if the approaching car is an enemy or ally it s that polished.Mechanics This is my favorite part about Rocket League. The game is simple enough to pick up drive and push the ball around. Then you begin doing double jumps and flips realizing that you can contort your vehicle (and physics) to your whim. You can spin twist and turn in place easing the ball in the direction you want it to go. From there you keep pushing learning formations communication and positioning. Then you learn how to fly. That s probably the most enjoyable and frustrating thing about Rocket League the flight. You have to learn it if you want to get out of the lower leagues but it is so rewarding. This game offers a low barrier to entry with a very high skill ceiling. Even with my hours I have a long long way to go before I call myself an expert at anything but that skill progression is what keeps me going. Week after week I can see myself improving and that feels awesome.Fun Factor The variety of modes keeps me entertained allowing me to play daily without getting bored or burned out. I play Doubles (2v2) Standard (3v3) Snow Day (3v3 Hockey) Hoops (2v2 Basketball) and Rocket Labs (Experimental 3v3 arenas). There s enough variety that I feel engaged constantly which is a refreshing change of pace from most games. The custom games are a blast too with plenty of mutators to create interesting modes. My personal favorite is turning the gravity all the way up (which disables jumps) and turning on instant demolitions. Now you ve got a demolition derby. XD If professional gaming is your thing the Rocket League Championship Series is proving to be really popular expect a growing e sports community from this one.Rating I give Rocket League a solid 9.5/10. The execution is solid the content is updated regularly and there are new modes cars and arenas every few months. For the paltry asking price there s plenty of fun to be had. Don t miss this title!!,Rocket League®

2017-09-27,0,0,18,False,Recommended,You have a stadium. You have a battle car. You have a ball. You have simple controls. Does that mean the game is simple? Yes! Does that mean the game is easy boring or that it sucks? No definitely not! General Features Rocket League features several modes as example an online mode at which you can play ranked and unranked games varying between 1 vs. 1 2 vs. 2 3 vs. 3 and 4 vs. 4. Of course you can also play with your friends at home via. local co op because it's one of the games which has a splitscreen mechanism for up to 4 players true old school gaming! It also features several offline modes such as exhibition matches against bots or season mode against bots. And of course it also features a tutorial and a training mode which both are well made. Gameplay Rocket League is incredibly balanced. Ever battle car has the same speed the same maneuverability and the same jump height. The only thing which is slightly different between the battle cars is the hitbox but you probably won't notice that the hitbox is different at all. The general gameplay is very fast very fun and very addictive. The controls are simple but mastering the cars and the battle car is difficult. The bots are playing surprisingly good there's a high possibility that you will lose your first games against the bots. Customization possibilities Players are able to customize their battle car by unlocking items which are gained by completing an online or offline match. This includes changing the body decal (skin) paint wheels rocket trail topper (hat) and antenna of the battle car. In total there are more than 150 customization items unlockable which means that there are millions of different customizations possible My conclusion Rocket League is incredibly fun. Rocket League is incredibly addictive. Rocket League is incredibly competitive. If I would have to compare the gameplay to another game I would only be able to choose Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket Powered Battle Cars which is the prequel to Rocket League made by the same developer. I strongly recommend to buy this game even if you don't like sports games as Rocket League feels way different compared to FIFA or PES. In my opinion Rocket League is definitely worth the money.,Rocket League®

2016-02-12,0,0,1412,False,Recommended,Rocket league is a funny game that mixes cars with football. play with friends for a laugh and have fun or challenge other players with a very competitive style in Ranked Seasons. Lots of DLC Including a cool back to the future delorean time machine (Quick note DLC cars DO NOT give you an advantage whilst playing and only add cool customization) . I have only put a full 24 hours into the game but I love it to bits. GAME PROS Easy to learn with good training gamemodes. 4 DLC Packs. The Ability to customize your vechile in many ways. Ranked Seasons. Loads of maps with different styles. Capture replays of your best moments. Exhibtion mode which lets you mess about with settings like gravity and more. GAME CONS The ability to hit the ball into the goal a soon as the game and or round starts although you can use this as a tactical advantage. This game can really grind your gears even if your not playing ranked. Matchmaking sometimes puts you with people who leave the game instantly or dont know how to play. I honestly can't think of any more bad things about this game its deffinetly worth the money 10/10 Would love to see brum in a DLC for this game,Rocket League®

It's so much more.This game has endless possibilities and a long list of terms that you might not even encounter until you've put more than 1300 hours in.The combinations you can make with your teammates the sick moves you can pull off on your own it goes beyond your imagination. If you just start playing this game might seem simple and not much fun.But it gets so much more fun the better you get at it.Aerialing through the sky getting a ceiling shot or a pinch safe... it feels so amazing when you're able to pull it off.The community might be somewhat toxic but it's much nicer than most competitive games.Don't like a game? Leave. Don't like a ranked game? Put up with it because the game probably won't last longer then five short or long minutes.The customization of the cars is amazing as well the amount of different decals toppers boost trails goal explosions... most of them even beautiful! I'm not talking about the toppers or antennas most of them are UGLEH .It's just a lot of fun simple to play a few games of simple to quit when tired beautiful arenas I just...can't recommend this game enough. If you want to see what kind of possibilities lie in this game... watch the pro's. They make the impossible happen they make this game seem amazing... and also simple. Don't expect that you can do what they do.But... try it. Try it anyway. BUY IT.,Rocket League®

2016-06-03,1,16,814,False,Not Recommended,Only purchase if you have friends to play with and have fun.Otherwise it's not worth a penny due to the quality of matchmaking.

No matter how good you are within a team you will rise or fall depending on whether you win or lose. Carried a game with 3 goals and 1000 points but lost? Too bad you will downrank because of your teammates. And you can't really blame them.This leads to incorrect ranks and horribly unbalanced matchmaking. Ranks should be determined by YOUR skill not your teammates'. The ranking system is an absolute 0/10.Imagine a ranking system consisting of two rows of code lose_elo (when you lose)gain_elo (when you win)Because this is Rocket League.

2017-06-13,0,0,28,False,Not Recommended,"It's hard for me to give this game a negative because I really enjoy it (at least I used to). What I can say about this game is I recommend it if you're on a PC (windows) and if you can use it with a controller. What my problem with this game is is the awful mac port and support it's been getting. Around 7 months ago an update was released and it kind of broke the mac version. A few new bugs came in and the framerate was butchered a ton but the biggest problem is a bug with the steam controller. As I said this game is really only worth playing if you're using a controller but with this glitch the steam controller no longer works. I've also heard of people having this problem with a few other controllers as well but I know that some controllers such as the Xbox 360 controller should work. Back when this happened I just decided to wait to see if they'd make a bug fix well that never happened at least a successful one. They've released a few bug fixes that are supposed to fix these issues but they actually do nothing many people (including me) have contacted Psyonix to ask them to fix this bug but all of them have just said the bug has already been fixed and if we're still having the problem ""they'l work on it"". So really what I can say is do not get this game if you're playing on a Mac even if you aren't going to use a controller. It's just a horrible port I'm not sure if this issue is also happening on Linux but I do remember a few linux users saying they had the same issue.",Rocket League®

2016-11-26,1,1,1683,False,Recommended,I got this game using a $20 gift card from a friend and it exceeded my expectations by miles. Pros The learning curve is very well done. You always play against players right around your skill level and no matter how good you are you will always have more to learn. It isn't tooo stressful of a game. It runs really well on my computer though there are some complaints on the lower end of specs. Try to at least meet the minimum specs. You can party with other players (on the same platform as you) and team up in 2v2 3v3 and 4v4. It goes beyond soccer with gamemodes like Rumble Hoops and Snow Day. The developers continue to update the game with more community suggested features.Cons The Aquadome arena is very stressful on lower end computers. The reporting system still needs some work.

The controls looked akward gameplay bland and overall not something that I would actualy play... and then I played it... and oh I couldn't be much wronger... you should NEVER judge a book by its cover. Who knew RC cars and big soccer balls would make such a good combo? Rocket league is a big game of soccer but with a twist rather than having people kick the ball instead you control RC cars (which by the way are fully customizable) and must hit the ball via bumbs jumps and turbo boosters. 4v4s are pure chaotic fun with extreme concentrations of action at all times while 2v2s are more tactical and competitive with every moment keeping you on your toes. The game features an epic soundtrack plenty of customizations for your vehicles and tons of fun for you and your friends. Even if you aren't a soccer or racing kind of guy you should still give Rocket League a chance. It just may surprise you.Pros + Competitive play+ Amazing soundtrack+ Plenty of customization+ Many gamemodes+ Up to 4 on 4 games+ Quick 5 minute games+ Great graphics and optimization+ Turbo boosters+ Cross playCons Camera angles can get fidgety Your average teammate will not always be up to snuff Servers with both PC and console players can get laggyConclusion There really aren't any big problems with this game. It offers tons of fun for the price of $20 USD and with friends competitive play will keep you on your toes. I recommend even people who don't really like soccer (me) to try this game out as the fun in RC cars and giant soccer balls just may surprise you.Score 8/10Worth a buy at full price? Yes,Rocket League®

2018-01-01,0,0,320,False,Not Recommended,This game would be good if everything wasn't tied to the server's connection quality Blowing other people up and collisions in particular are the most inconsistant and RNG 'features' in the game. Matchmaking rarely actually puts you in a playable/winable match unless scoring 5 8 goals in 35 seconds is somehow consistantly possible to do. Even after 2 years this is still a problem.The most annoying thing for me in particular is the fact that the game's default position while in the air is pointed downwards so if there is any fluactuation with connection ( on my end or the server end) the game will default your car to that position while flying with a rocket boost so rather than actually flying you get a face full of floor while the car completely refuses to even lean back and actually do what you're controlling it to do.,Rocket League®

2017-01-16,0,0,412,False,Recommended,My view on this game? Buy it ONLY if you want to play it with your friends or on single player. The players on the server are (mostly) rude childish and sour losers often abandoning matches and storming out with other players on the team.As far as the game goes it's a lot of fun! The graphics are cool the gameplay is easy to catch and has a good set of skills to master.I strongly recommend it!! Again as far as you don't play with strangers.,Rocket League®
2016-08-25,0,0,1568,False,Recommended,Edit Respect to Psyonix for making free maps and listening to the community and this game was phenomenal when it first came out but ever since the Rumble update last September the glitch of passing through the ball has gotten so much worse... now on every map I play it seems. When it used glitch every blue moon now several times per match. Which sucks for me since I invested at least $25 (There are some who've spend hundreds) on keys for exclusive cars that sometimes pass literally through the ball or a millimeter to the left or right of it. So when hitting the ball is the entire point of RL said glitch kinda makes it unplayable at least in hopes of actually ranking. It's still fun to play around with friends so I still recommend the game under the circumstances that you don't expect much from ranking. 6/10,Rocket League®
2016-08-26,0,0,33,False,Recommended,Rocket League Fun if you like soccer and cars this is the game for you. you can play with your friends for hours days months YEARS DECADES EVEN wait how old am I now?,Rocket League®
2017-12-20,0,0,1387,False,Not Recommended,updated I have put so many more hours into this game I own every version of this game and I absolutely love it. If you don't wanna waste money I'll tell you right now don't buy it the developers need to rework rank still at plat level and diamond level teammates consistently score on you. Another note to point out is that if you win with a teammate 9/10 you will be against them the next round and if you lose with a teammate 9/10 you will be on the same team again. So basically if you and a teammate have bad chemistry your gonna eat two losses instead of one because ranked is so bad. Majorty of players are gold and plat which is imbalanced there is no grind because you win 3 matches lose one and you drop more mmr than you gain and theres nothing you can do cause it matches you with the same teammates over and over and it's extremely hard to even go up one division. Also skill level of plat pc player vs plat console player is extremely different however you can overcome this obstacle by disable cross platform play.old 12/20/17 While the game itself is fun beyond all doubt never play ranked/competitive. This is a soccer game with cars yet all you see up to plat and diamond are hot shots who don't know how to play as a team and were carried to a higher rank. The ranking system needs rebalanced since most ppl are gold and obviously thats unrealistic.,Rocket League®

2017-12-19,2,2,739,False,Not Recommended,Seems fun at first but then you discover things like physics being weird hitboxes being totally different size/shape than the actual cars... Also the ranking system is garbage. I have played like 1000 matches in solo standard with 56% win rate and stayed around low gold all time. Sometimes the game even demotes you after winning a game. Also trolls and griefers run rampant and never get banned. Don't buy this game if you are a competitive player.,Rocket League®

Microtransactions all over the place item trading and people trying to scam you toxic players in literally EVERY match and that's just casual play. In cometitive 90% of the players are just s. blaming others for their mistakes and swearing the whole time. I really miss the time when I could just play a friendly game with strangers quietly level up and try some crazy cosmetic combos. In one of my the last matches someone from my team asked me for my level and when I told him he discussed in chat if they should kick me just because of my level.

Keys cost quite a bit of money.2. You can easily have a situation in which you get 4 times the same useless item out of a box due to increased drop chances of standard items and no protection against redundant drops whatsoever.3.

2017-10-29,0,0,925,False,Not Recommended,Rocket League servers are pure trash right now (since 3 weeks) ultra laggy as soon as the game starts the cars drive like jelly (unlike local games againt the IA that are perfectly fine proof that it's coming from the lags).Random pinches with a light speed ball are happening all the time since the game/server doesn't know what is currently happening on the field or who hit the ball first.I'm on a 15 20 games losing streak (from diamond II) since the servers became trash.I have one of the best and fastest internet connection available in France with a ping below 10 all the time.As a long time RL and SARPBC player I feel like I must give a negative feedback to RL and hopefully some people will do the same thing until we have some good servers again.,Rocket League®

Some say that how is it possible to enjoy playing a game which you control a car to play football. Well every match is unique. Like in real life football matches. 5 minute match time is the best. Just play one game you'll have a great time. Play for long hours still you'll have fun. You should play with at least one friend thus you can carry each other in competitive mode.

And if all of the sudden you have to do something else and you quit the game you are punishd because it's a competitive match BUT IT SHOULDN'T BE PSYONIX. I play this game since April 2017 and back then this was a really fun game but today i don't even know what it is anymore. The game is dead. You didn't just lose a gamer you lost a regular player.

I got 4 crashes so far in just one hour. And not allowed to rejoin either. After last update I can't rejoin any game at all.Could like allow rejoin then remove the ban if I rejoin the same game. Or just at least allow me to rejoin so I don't leave my teammates to the oblivion with an unbalanced team which wasn't their fault first of all.Or at least disable or lower ban time to 1 minute until they fix either the crashing bug or the unable to rejoin issue.Also the fact that there's no casual play anymore is a bit annoying because I enjoyed playing without fear of demoting other players down because of my noobiness.

2017-02-13,0,0,65,False,Not Recommended,Awful toxic waste of human DNA community. In fact if you do like this game I encourage a heavy diet of Cyanide. The game itself is a great concept but... utterly useless.Here is how I get that conclusion.This is supposed to be a fun game to pick up and play just arcade fun if you will but the competitive matchmaking ruined the game for me every single time I played it. The matchmaking doesn't make the slightest effort to pair teams with like skills instead you get two guys who can't seem to find the ball or can't seem to find the correct goal and they continue to be a nuisance... HOWEVER the casual matchmaking is much much better because you can continue leaving matches with utterly useless players until you find a group you really have fun with. This is the only reason I still have the game installed. And this is the only reason I recommend playing. Honestly Every competitive game has this flaw and is the reason I am not buying any game claiming to have a competitive structure. It wastes resources and it is useless.This game is complete fun with the right teamates even when you lose badly you can still have fun and those moments make this game a complete joy to own but when you join a ranked gameplay server you throw all that out the window and the game becomes useless garbage because it doesn't work.Oh and did I mention utterly useless community and microtransactions? Say no to drugs. say no to rocket league.Oh and competeitive play? THis games physics and net code are so bad 1v1 matchmaking is only fun if you love not knowing if your opponent hads warped into your goal or not. The competitive nature of this game can be summarized simply as this A big esport Circle Jerk. Don't waste your time because the moment you get in a comp match and leave it bans you even from casual matchmaking in increasingly annoying and utterly wasteful amounts of time.If I could get my money back on any game I have This would be the one. But since I can't refund such a peice of utter waste of cyberspace I'll troll it for many years.,Rocket League®

Well this game is incredibly team oriented so you must rely on your teammates and they must rely on you. So what if one of you up? Yeah thats basically how matchmaking goes. Every game is just a lab experiment on how humans react when trying to work together to achieve a common goal (no pun intended). Sometimes the players on the same team work together and support each other but what too often the case is they roast each other and destroy each others motivation to achieve that common goal.,Rocket League®

2018-11-12,1,3,1368,False,Not Recommended,first good game usually really fun. awesome concept easy to learn hard to master.but the servers are beyond everything that is acceptable. for some reason psyonix can throw away millions of dollars for esport events but not offer reliable service for the playerbase. you know the 99 9999% of people who finance the game. as long as they don't fix the servers i can't really recommend it.Psyonix here is a pro tip why don't you offer just 750.000 dollars in prize money for teenagers and use the rest to rent better servers? you know machines that don't just screw one player randomly over. or servers that don't randomly disconnect. or servers that don't feel like gambling in regards to touches or demolitions.,Rocket League®

2018-03-10,0,0,133,False,Recommended,Super fun game. It's not hard at all to learn to play but takes alot of dedication and hours to master. A simple but very addictive game. The base choice of cars is good alot of things to unlock (decals hats antennas etc). Every unlockable are cosmetics so no unfair games for newbies. Getting good is just about practice practice and more practice.They have a fairly good choice of DLC cars taht aren't that expensive. Both a good way to treat yourself and to support the development of the game. Those cars however aren't OP or anything like that. For most players it's just about the looking because you'll slighly notice the differnce between the car. You'll mostly feel it when you'll get super good at the game. Best part of this? The current favorite car of pro players is a free one that everyone has. So it remains fair and cool for everyone.It took me a very long time to get myself into buying this and I dont regret it. I have alot of fun in competitive solo and I enjoy very much playing with friends in casual. Just remain calm and have some fun this game's awesome!,Rocket League®

2018-06-22,0,0,6,False,Recommended,Product received for free. Playing this on console with my other friends forced me to come back to this game. I orginally got this game on Steam as a gift from a friend. If you're looking for some fun with some friends and family of all ages I highly recommend this. It changes the whole experience. It makes a party memorable. Though I strongly recommend you use a controller. Playing in keyboard and mouse is a straight disadventage and does not make the game worth to buy. But it easily dies off if you don't have any players around. Now you wouldn't get endless hours on this or last the whole day playing this single game. I spend very few hours on the game. The gameplay's simple with a few mechanics. Aerial seems interesting though.It's a decent and average game but not a god tier game. As I said playing this with other friends makes it extermely fun and does make parties memorable. I would give this out a try.,Rocket League®

Made it to gold status playing in leagues and since I have had 9 games 2v3 in a row because there is no penalty at all for just bailing on a game. Couple that with the fact that their reporting of cheaters means absolutely nothing and you have a great game turned terrible by the company that makes it.

WARNING This product contains addictive substances.I have been playing this game in pretty much all my free time since christmas of 2016. I'm pretty sure I need help.Rocket League ReviewFor a game with very few gamemodes (in comparison to other multiplayer games) this one is surprisingly addictive. I'm not even a fan of soccer! However there are many many aspects to this game that will keep you entertained for 2 20 200 or even 2000 hours plus. That 'drive' for the next goal the next epic save the next cool new item for your sick newly tricked out automobile... this game has more to offer than just a two goal soccer match.The GamesRocket League comes with a few gamemodes. Dropshot Hoops Rumble and of course socCAR. football for everyone else Each gamemode has it's own uniqueness to it. On top of that there is different types of player amounts Chaos (4v4) Standard (3v3) Doubles (2v2) and my favorite Duel (1v1). Each gamemode requires a different playstyle so don't expect one strategy in one gamemode to work in another!Skill LevelI've talked to friends who say they don't want this game because they don't believe they'd be ""good enough"" at it. That's silly. While it is true you WILL be bad at this game upon purchase (probably very bad if you're new) you will be paired with others who are just like you. There is a natural ranking system in this game similar to other games with a major difference. That difference is that you are no better or worse off than your opponent reguarding equiptment. There is no decal wheels or rocket trail they can put on their car that will make them a better player than you. looking at you Scorpion from COD. And if you stick with this game you WILL get better. A LOT better.TradingPersonally I love the trading system of this game although expect to pull your wallet out if you want to open crates on your own. get the five key deal for five bucks that way they don't rip you off. You can get some really amazing looking cars from trading. There are so many items avaliable in different rarities and different series of items. Of course that may not be your thing which is completely fine as well.VerdictRocket League is a simple game with a simple objective. Score. How you come about doing it is what's difficult. But when you do score you'll be wanting more and that's where Rocket League shines. This game does well in presenting itself in every way. It looks beautiful it is incredibly satisfying and it has awesome potential for car customization. Overall I'd definitely recommend this drug game.",Rocket League®

2017-03-24,0,0,280,False,Not Recommended,"So before I explain why I don't recommend this game I will say it is a GREAT concept and loads of fun. The reason I do not recommend it is because arguably the MOST IMPORTANT part of this game is completely broken the ranking system in competitive games. The reason I call this the most important part of the game is because this is supposed to be the system that sets you with people of your skill however you are more likely to find an equal match in the casual play.Let me explain. To determine which rank you should be placed in at first the game has you play 10 games and because I won 8 out of the 10 games I was placed as a ""Prospect Elite"" rank for Standards (3 v. 3) which at the time was the 4th rank. Then immediately after being placed in Prospect Elite I lost roughly 10 games in a row and was dropped 2 ranks lower. The baffling flaw in this is that out of those ten games I scored the highest score of all 6 players in at least 7 of those games. The game does not consider how well you performed and ranks you purely off wins and losses. And quite ironically shortly following this my team won several games but I had close to the LOWEST score every time and I went up a division. This rediculous luck of the draw matchmaking system means you could end up playing any skill level player or be the lowest rank even if you scored 7 goals on your own between your ""teammates"" constantly crashing into you while the other team commulatively scored 8 goals. So even though you scored 500 points higher than anyone in the game you go down a division. Ironically this means that the matchmaking system works better in casual play than in competitive. In casual play other players are placed with you based off their in game level and ultimately ends up typically creating more even games. I can't even play ranked matches anymore because the whole system is a complete joke and I am for lack of a better word baffled that the developers of the game do not notice or do anything about this flaw.",Rocket League®

2018-06-06,1,2,942,False,Not Recommended,"It was a fun game a few years ago but I really hate the direction they've taken with it. While the game itself is a ton of fun they still haven't managed to fix servers after so many years and I still will have everybody in a private match just drop from a server. Not to mention the bad lag/rubberbanding on a 200 mb/s ethernet connection.There is also the loot boxes. I know these are becoming regular in games but I still hate it. You unlcok cosemetics through a spinning wheel and it almost feels engineered to make you want to spin one more time. I can't tell you how many times I've near missed a black market or exotic. At this point I don't even try anymore. Some people I know have been able to trade their way to the top and can get basically anything but this requires crazy dedication and time that to me isn't worth it.Finally there is the future rocket pass that was recently announced. It's pretty much a rip off of Fortnite's battle pass. From what it looks like it will have a free and premium version thjat will allow you to unlock items and decryptors for crates (yay lootboxes). Like the Fortnite battle pass it will likely need to be renewed every few months for premium passes. Ontop of all of this there are DLC packs that offer extra cars and if you don't buy all of them you get an annoying bright yellow ""SHOWROOM"" tab on your main menu showing you all the stuff you don't have and can't have if you don't hand over extra money. This was fine when all the other stuff wasn't in the game but they're seriously asking for a lot at this point. I'd personally be alright with this if Rocket League was a free to play game and at this point it should be. If it was just the 20 dollars I'd say go for it and it would be a 10/10 in my book. If rewards were based on a battle pass style system that you DIDN'T have to pay for that would be awesome. If there were no microtransactions/loot boxes it would be well worth it. If the game becomes free to play I'll change my review to positive or delete it all together. Say what you will about Fortnite but they're doing things the way Rocket League should be doing things and after so much fatigue over lootboxes and microtransactions in other games I'm tired of having it shoved in to my face in the one game I used to play all the time.",Rocket League®

2017-12-11,3,3,1434,False,Not Recommended,Spent a lot of time with this game.Had fun playing it. But the people in this game are the least scum of the earth when you see how they behave.Now I'm getting lag spikes randomly through out the game. There is nothing active except for RL but apparently that is enough. Didn't have those before.I am going through cars when i am in supersonic mode instead of blowing them up. With soft touches i am lagging underneath the ball so it looks on the replay like i touched it but it immediately goes down as if i didn't touch it at all. It's like the ball hits a bump but gravity is so hard it just pulls it down again without any movement of the ball higher in the air.Thanks. Honestly thanks. Then the matchmaking is the iest i have seen in a long time. I have to play against GC's with their whole team all the time. I am not good enough to play against gc's for s sake. Just because one of them has a lower mmr than any other on the team doesn't mean that it is fair to put none GC's up against a GC a friend that is probably around champ and one that is maybe diamond 1. The MMR difference is ing 800 you o's. What is fair about that if the overall MMR of the team is that high above yours ?Go yourselfs psyonix honestly. The Rocket pass is a rip off if you are not playing hard all the time since some people have to work almost every day until late at night and can't grind that hard. With the free version you get NOTHING WORTH putting in any effort.Sorry but this game is not enjoyable if you have reached your skill cap and are forced to play against people that make you look like a fool and your team is around the same as you are.Fix you psyonix and maybe then i will take a look at it again.,Rocket League®

Considering I've only ever defended myself from targeted trolls calling me everything under the sun after they lose. Maybe a screenshot with a support number would be acceptable. Even then a properly timed screenshot could make anybody look like the instigator. You managed friendly fire with this ban. So as a warning to others trolls are becoming a plague by spamming reports on the same person. When you play late like I do you'll encounter the same group of people over and over who verbally harass you until you type something in retaliation. Then the entire team of trolls will report you continuiously every match. Just to find out the next day you're unable to play. Get it together and get the real culprits. The instigators.

This is a spectatular game you can play soccer (which is most popular and default) hockey basketball heck even a version of Mario called Rumble! You are a car that is rocket propelled and your objective is to score shots into other's people net while keep yours safe from enemies. There are hundreds of skills to learn like redirects double touches air dribbles aerials the list goes on! There are thousands of variables to customize your car! There is also ranked modes. Ranked modes 1v1 2v2 3v3 3v3 (solo). There you can play to get to a higher rank and earn sweet prizes when the season ends depending on what rank you were on. If you are wondering what (solo) means in 3v3 it means you cant play in a party. A party is where you invite your steam games to come play with you in this rocket propelled game.

Maybe they would score more if they didn't flop everytime someone stepped on their toe.""Not a huge fan of racing games and I HATE sports games ( I mean I like to play sports for real but I hate watching them or playing the video game alternatives). But this is way more than just cars pushing a ball around. The controls are amazing. I'v never felt like I'v had this much control of what's going on in a sports game as I do with this. It's basically NINJA CARS. WTF is better than ninja cars?! Thats what I thought.. Nothing. You can jump double jump. air dash and even fly. There's driving on and up walls flips.. You name it. The action is intense your fingers will hurt your face will hurt from laughing and if your throat doesn't hurt by the time your done then you aren't communicating with your teammates and communication is key.. Even if it's call your buddy a d0uche for hogging the ball.. How will he ever learn otherwise?10/10 for me. It's a great game.

2017-03-22,0,0,361,False,Not Recommended,Hella hours in the game so here are some pros and cons. Pros it's fun as hell to play especially with friends. Cons B******* COLLISION DETECTION (1) Matchmaking against players several teirs higher than you on a regular basis (including in my experience a rookie against a g****** legend) fly hards try hard teammates b******* collision detection players talking smack young kids (under twelve) talking smack about f****** your mom almost as bad as a first person competitive shooter physics(2) oh and b******* collision detection. Overall not recommended because the b******* definitely outweighs the fun with friends.1) You are also unable to score on anyone roughly two teirs higher than you since they have had more hours and thus far more experience than you as well as chances are they are flyhards. 2) Literally you enter a match and if you touch the ball at the same time as the opposing person chances are it's going to fly backwards towards your goal most likely flying back almost as if with an aimbot and scoring on your goal,Rocket League®

Our ranks are champ 1 champ 2 and champ 3. Rocket league has this mechanic in play to stop smurfing. However its litterly beneficial for us if my friend buys a new accound to get reranked to play with us.

2017-08-03,0,0,1447,False,Recommended,rocket league is a great game about a strange but interesting way to play the game of soccer. The game is a simple thing to understand but deeply complicated as you get into more advanced movements and manouvers that you can execute. The casual gamemode is fun to mess around in with friends and to improve your gameplay before heading into the competitive gamemode and really focusing on improving and rising the many skill tiers that there are. Rocket league is the best 20$ i have ever spent on anything i have ever purchased and i would recommend it to anyone who doesnt mind a bit of a learning curve every now and then.,Rocket League®

In fact the biggest I have seen in comparison to any other game I have ever played. I learned about this game after I stumbled upon a video of Kronovi playing a match. I told myself I would not stop playing till I was able to play like him. It has been over a year with many hundreds of hours on ps4 possibly over 1000 logged and I am not even close. If you give up easily this game might not be for you. If you truly want to be challeneged then buy and download this game!,Rocket League®

2016-09-13,0,0,634,False,Recommended,This is the perfect time to buy this game. With the addition of crates and trading Psyonix is trying to push towards turning into a much larger eSport and with the developing playerbase it's likely headed in the right direction.It's a super fun game no matter where your skill level is at. Even in casual mode the game evaluates your skills and places you with other players in the same area. Smurfing in competitive is not very common and has been actively fought against by Psyonix.One of the best aspects of this game by far is the responsiveness of the devs. If you head over to reddit.com/r/RocketLeague you can find lots of posts with development members of Psyonix openly interacting with the community for suggestions and ideas to improve the game and efficiently put out hotfixes.Get it. Try it. If you don't love it within the 1.5 hours of your beginning play return it. I doubt it'll happen.,Rocket League®

ROCKET LEAGUE! The most videogame of videogames of the XXI century! First Review Probably one of the most spectular and fun multiplayer games ever made. Better than the prequel which had multi leveled maps and made gameplay a bit harder Rocket League takes the same soccer with cars concept simplifies it to a simple arena amazingly good gameplay and a killer soundtrack. Pros Multiplayer is super funGreat options for costumizationRuns great on low end machines (as long as you don't turn max settings)ConsSingle player can get boring (who plays this game alone anyways)Some lag at the beginning of certain matches (not always)Overall 9/10Multiplayer Game of the Summer Award,Rocket League®

I wish there was a spotify connection that let you play your own music while you play (there might be but im just not up to date with it). soundtrack is still SOLID3. Loot crates. couldnt care less for it. 4. Customization is perfect except for tiny issues.

Add in lag issues and this game still gets a major thumbs down.IN THE END The game was origionally great. since then every update has made it worse.

2017-03-24,0,0,502,False,Not Recommended,nearly 400 hours in and the game is still plagued with issues that it had from day 1 and those are as follows.1 Horrid matchmaking which matches you with people well away from your skill is a joke and should have been fixed a long time ago2 Pants servers they are awful even though your ping is good if not brilliant that does not dictate how smooth the game will be the rubber banding is shocking and at times unplayable.3 And the saving the best for the last THE POOR COMMUNITY! the community is a bunch of autistic gob shites who don't know thier from thier elbow who will flame you constantly even though they are the ones making the mistakes and loosing you the game generally resulting in a division down or de rank in competitive. Psyonix need a way to filter out the trash players who troll constantly causing de ranks as it is unfair to the genuine people playing the game to have fun and enjoy themselves. It down right puts people of the gameMy word of advice for this is keep a cool head and report anyone who is trying to do what I described hopefully us the community can make a difference and make the game more enjoyable in the process.Don't get me wrong this game has plenty of good points and it is genuinely a fun and enjoyable game that has some the best tense and brilliant moments of a comp game I have played in a long time and the Esports side of this game is amazing to watch I love this game however as you can probably tell that recently I have just been fed up and let down by the above points which is a shame.if you do buy this game make sure to have someone or a group of friends to play with as it will make it more enjoyable than soloing your way through it.,Rocket League®
2015-08-12,0,0,574,False,Recommended,This game is extremely entertaining and matches only last for 5 minutes so it's easy to jump into when you only hve a small amount of spare time. The gameplay is fast paced and the matchmaking is on an ELO basis so you generally find an equal matchup for your skill level.The only negatives I would mention are random lag spikes (which thankfully aren't too frequent) and the fact that bots are hit and miss they either set up shots/goals perfectly or they camp their own goal and then fail to save even a soft shot meaning you can't trust them. They also seem to delight in deflecting your shots away from the opponent's net and deliberately shooting the ball back to your own half. Better bot AI would be my number 1 update,Rocket League®

Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9 inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate pour in apple slices.4. Roll out top crust into a 10 inch circle. Cut into 8 (1 inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips one at a time into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.5. Pour butter sugar mixture over top of pie coating the lattice and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes.

It has one of the the highest skill ceilings in any game I saw to date but is also very easy to get into and feels immensly satisfying at any skill level.The matches are short enough so that even if you're getting crushed you don't feel like the pain never ends and if you're enjoying the game (not necessarily winning yes) the length is perfect.Indeed it's a deeply enjoyable game even when you're loosing most of your matches as performing any defence/shot on goal/goal etc feels great even if at the end of the day you didn't manage to win the match.The addition of custom game modes and periodic fun updates makes this a definite must have in my oppinion!,Rocket League®

Pros Competative addicting tons of people playing easy to learn controls (with controller) and fun for all ages.Cons Other players can be quite verbally abusive.

2016-05-16,0,0,288,False,Recommended,Not since the original Xbox game Deathrow have I enjoyed an arena based futuristic sports game to this extent. It's very intricate and skill based (with a little twist of luck thrown in for good measure). Time spent better play and is very rewarding. It's fun it's innocent (my 7 year old loves to play it although to this point I'm not letting him play online which is perfectly acceptable given all of the season options customisability mutators training and usage of bots). That being said I've only encountered friendly play online and of course you can mute chat features and report players etc. if that ever becomes a problem. I found this game for around 12 dollars and that was a STEAL considering how much gameplay I'm likely to get out of those dollars. Also my 360 controller works fantastically. It's not terribly likely that this will appeal to someone and then NOT turn out to be a worthy purchase. Just watch some gameplay vids and if you're like me you'll want to pick it up.

They didn't put too much thought in making the port. Cross network is definetly a no no. PS players have terrible skills overall and you can't even tell them to stop acting like a mad dog. Unranked is bugged at the moment because servers for cross platform and PC platform are combined into one giant up meaning you can't play unless you wanna spend 30 40 minutes waiting. Ranked is a nightmare. You get sent to ranked from unranked because you want to play competetive games but what's that? Even the worst players can screw you over? Yes yes they canI had challanger 3 and couldn't go higher because everytime I won a game I would lose the next one due to receiving the dumbest human alive. There is no limit. You can get a newbie in your game to get rising star and he can completely you over. This morning I had 10 games in a row of complete idiots.

Its basically the regular game but you have special abilities that you can use during the game to spice things up. Theres a magnet ability which pulls the ball towards you theres an ability that lets you switch spots with an enemy an ability to knock the ball forward sending it to (or away from) a goal and many more abilities you can use.

Sometimes when I tell what game I am playing to my dad I usually just explain it as playing soccer with cars that has rockets on them. I know that may not sound like much but to me it means a lot of fun and excitement. It doesn't matter to me if I win or lose I always enjoy having fun and it can also be more fun with my friends in Rocket League. I would recommend this game any day to a family member or friend.

2016-07-19,0,0,51,False,Recommended,"Gotta recommend this game. My fiancee and I play splitscreen all the time and the hockey mode is our favorite (we're Canadian of course). Honestly though it's a clean crisp responsive program with excellent design. Our XB360 controllers are a natural extension to the game even though I play every other game I own with a mouse/keyboard. I never feel completely out of my league because the servers do a decent job matching us with similarly experienced players. The in game ""achievements"" (making a save scoring) pop up and make me feel pro in the middle of a match even if we're losing. I never cared too much for sports games (played a few for Sega Gen back in the day haha). It feels exciting to make a great save or have a close match. The devs keep it well updated and the community seems pretty active. We exclusively play onlnie pick up matches but the ""season"" system is fun as well.

Many players just run aimlessly to just hit the ball without thinking where it will land.

2016-11-27,0,0,744,False,Recommended,Addictive. It belongs to the class of co op sports games like PES FIFA NBA2K. Perfect for playing locally or with online friends.The matchmaking element is decent needs better implementation since most of the times players with unequal game experience end up in the same team and that creates issues (and harms the community). The bot players which are used to cover for players that leave during the game are not in the same level as the other players.Good work in the networking capabilities and waiting times.,Rocket League®

2017-03-11,0,0,1811,False,Recommended,First Review Progression system is amazing at each title you feel like youve improved so much and the levelling system more accurately reflects your ability than most other games.Gameplay Simple and easy. Its no pay to win purely based on you and your team mates skill levels. The sky is the limit.Graphics As good as you could want from a gameVersatility As far as car football goes the game allows you to do anything. With boost air rolls double jumps etc... you can hit the ball wherever it is and how you wantCustomization Crates are a little expensive for their value but if you are willing to buy on the trading market prices are fair (just be aware of scammers) cars are extremely customizable but not to the extent they look stupid. There is still the element of simpleness that I think is better.The game has had me hooked since purchase. There is just something about the gameplay that means once you reach a certain level it is just so much fun (when you are comfortable driving up walls and in the air),Rocket League®

I am not a big fan of racing cars but I am a big fan of soccer. The mixture of RC cars and soccer is FANTASTIC! This is actually a game that feels like playing soccer as you have to develop skills to be good at the game. The devs are also excellent and keep on updating the game with goodies and new game modes. The game is very easy to pick up but is HARD to master. As a bonus you can get to pwn PS4 and XboxOne players. 5/5",Rocket League®

2017-04-30,0,0,129,False,Recommended,Product received for free. I'm an old school SARB player. For those who don't know what SARB is it's the prequel to this game on PS3 which is Super Sonic Acrobatic Rocket Powered Battle Cars. I played SARB for about 10 years. Rocket League is decent but SARB will always be superior when it comes to skill base. ANYONE can get good at Rocket League. It's slower paced than SARB and the ball moves slower. SARB is faster ball is lighter and moves faster which requires more skill. Rocket League is fun when you're matched with someone who knows how to play correctly and properly especially in a 2v2. 2V2 is where all the skill is not 1v1. In 2v2 you need to know how to play with another person. You need to know how to set up catch set ups know how to do kick offs properly and just having common sense. If someone trash talks you and says let's 1v1 I'll beat you just laugh at them because 1v1 doesn't know skill. Knowing how to play a 2v2 properly is skill. Forget 3v3 and 4v4 as all that is is people running around hitting the ball just to hit it with no strategy whatsoever. There's no teamwork in 3v3 and 4v4. These live twitch events with Rocket League would be more fun to watch if they were 2v2 not 3v3. Having a 3v3 tourny is really dumb. Anyone can play a 3v3 and hit the ball when it rolls in front of the goal on the opposite side. Anyone who plays anything other than 2v2 and thinks their good is bad. That's just how it is. Any old school legend SARB player like myself will tell you everything I just said. If you want to be respected by us then play 2v2 properly.,Rocket League®

2016-01-10,0,0,45,False,Recommended,I really like tthe concept behind this game I think there's still room for development of new arenas with different terrains maybe even use of the fact that the cars can drive on the walls there could be a mode where the ball is magnatized and sticks to the walls to add a 3D type of arena.Overall I love this game the only critic I could say REALLY needs improvement is the AI I don't know how many times my stupid AI teammates scored in our own goal... I know the game is better online with real people but what's the point of having an offline version if the AI sucks.But don't let this deter you from buying this game!,Rocket League®

In rocket league zitten er ook andere niggurs achter je aan ook in een waggie maar dan voor de bal. psst. de bal is dus de drugs.Soms komt er een niggur in de hood achter je aan maar dan super snel! want hij hebt dat omin andere soorten drugs op waardoor die super snel rent!!!! In rocket league komt er ook een andere niggur achter je aan maar dan heel snel door de turbo!!!(mckwek). PSSSTT hier is de drugs dus ook de turbo snap je?Al in al enzo vind ik dit spel zeker de moeite waard om gratis te downloaden. Dus daarom geef ik het 7 kipcorns uit 10 salades. Rocket league kan zichzelf verbeteren door echte hoodniggurs in te huren voor de voice actors enzo.

2016-07-11,0,0,2439,False,Recommended,Rocket league is like drugs. The more you play the more you want to play.Rocket league is simple on the surface but needs communication and strategy between teammates at higher levels. It is the only E Sport that has ever captivated my attention. It is a bit of an emotional roller coaster at times though. Sometimes I feel accomplished after a hard earned victory while sometimes i want to kill my teammate.Rocket League is a game you need to put hours into to get better it's all about practice practice practice. You also need to be patient as being too aggressive will leave your goal wide open which is bad. One good thing is that controller and keyboard both work well. Most people say that you need a controller but I love keyboard and mouse just fine.Would I recommend this to a friend?Yes.

2016-07-07,0,0,446,False,Recommended,Rocket League is a very fun and challenging game. Some people may not like rocket league just by how its being shown in its pictures/trailer. Rocket league isnt just about smashing a ball into a goal. Its not just soccer. Its much more. I tought the same when i was about to purchace Rocket League. I was not sure if i wanted to get it. But i gave it a go. Rocket leagues new updates are making the game better and theres even more gamemodes. Theres now Hoops which is like basket ball. In Rocket League the main thing that makes it fun (for me atleast) are the good tricks and ariels. I love learning new moves and ariels are one of my favorite things in the game. If you are thinking of buying Rocket League or are just checking it out trust me its worth it give it a go. EHSA,Rocket League®

As you initially look at the game it seems that it is just soccer with cars. Once you start getting use to it as well as ball cam a whole new game emerges. Aerials dribbling passing pinches epic saves that give you goose bumps are all that awaits and this is when you realize this game is more than just soccer with cars. It is actually quite challenging unless you spend the hours but they were hours well spent. Thanks Psyonix for the wonderful game!!!,Rocket League®

2015-08-03,0,0,355,False,Recommended,REVIEW AS OF VERSION 1.19 9/10tl dr s dopeThis game's premise is pure and simple Football/Soccer with Rocket Powered Turbo Cars. If the concept alone isn't enough to get you interested then maybe you should get your head checked because that's the coolest thing I've ever heard of in my entire life.Like the concept the gameplay is also simple and there's a whole lot of fun to be had with it. Turbo boosting into the ball (or other cars) is extremely satisfying and you feel badass when you actually make that all important save or dunk some scrubs with an intense goal.Now for the actual review PROS + Very smooth and responsive controls + The game controls decently on keyboard though a controller is recommended + Ranked Play is a thing + Car Customization has just enough choices to make your car feel your own + Skill based + Cross platform play* + Rocket powered cars. + The game can be just as fun to watch as it is to play (imo). + Splitscreen play. + 100% customizable camera from FOV to the camera's angle and stiffness. + Matches last only 5 minutes so you can sit down and play a quick game if you don't have much time + DLC packs have been handled extremely well with decent pricing and a decent amount of purely cosmetic content + Mutators have been to the mix for private games which alter certain physics/aspects of the game and can amazing fun to mess around with + AMAZING soundtrack consisting of mainly electronica styled music. + Random item drops for extra toppers and such. This used to be a negative for me as you could get duplicates but in the new update you can trade in 5 of a same grade of item for a more rare grade. + Multiple game types and maps to spice things up. + Easily accesible e sports leagueCONS You will be bad at first this can discourage some people The AI is absolute garbage. Especially in Hoops The game can be extremely repetetive at times. The different game modes are just slight variations. ? It may just be me but I'd like an option for the soundtrack to continue playing during gameplay.CONCLUSION If you're okay with a bit of repetetive gameplay and want a game to just pick up and start having crazy fun right away I'd absolutely reccomend it for you.If you don't like the idea of having to practice A LOT to get better at the game or the repetative nature of it all is offputting then you'd be better off spending your money elsewhere NOTES *As of right now there is no way to actually party up cross platform which is sad because I have a lot of friends who play it on PS4/XBOX One and not PC. Hopefully this issue will be remedied. You can however all play in a private match using the room name and password system.,Rocket League®

If you want a fun easy to learn but hard to master game this is it for you. However that's only in singleplayer (NOTE in SP be prepared for autistic AI players) or if you play with friends. If you try to play competitively you will not only be put against players much much better than you you will also experience unbearable lag. As a final rant many maps are horrible to play on (Neo Tokyo in particular).If it's on sale for $10 sure grab it. For the current price of $24 (in NZD) try something else.,Rocket League®

2016-11-28,0,0,203,False,Recommended,Absolutley an amazing game. I have loved every second of this game. It is most enjoyable to me with 1 or 2 friends but the game still supplies a rather fun experience playing solo. Even if you do not enjoy the sport of soccer or Futbol this game will still intrigue and excite any player that joins the community. Excellent game with excellent game modes. Personal rating 9.5 out of 10 (5 Stars),Rocket League®

2016-12-20,0,0,25,False,Not Recommended,It was fun whileFirst of all I liked the gameplay it was unique in most of the way and this is something that not many games have. But my only gripe with the game is that eventually it gets boring and there is not much for it. It s would be better if they had different modes to the gameplay not just score that ball in the other player s goal.Overall 5.5/10,Rocket League®

2016-04-17,0,0,19,False,Recommended,I absolutley hate sports of any kind.Football is one of them. (Yes I think its stupid that America is the only country to call it soccer. Yes I'm American)I don't give two hoots for cars either. But if you combine them it just somehow... works.The music is great the customization is awesome and the cars look amazing.Now there are a few bad things.Playing with another region from your own tends to give you major connection errors seen as an unplugged cable in a triangle.Bad wifi makes this worse.Connection errors result in a little bit of lag. Lag isn't the bad part. Your car will bounce and glitch around sometimes a few inces results in you on the other side of the map.But that's about it.10/10(PS if you don't play with a controller you're pretty much ****ed.),Rocket League®

2015-07-21,0,0,515,False,Recommended,To be honest i wasn't thinking i will like this game so bad. It is a nice experience of fun. It is like FIFA but instead of gameplay same crap every year multiple bugs and others. we have all of this but in fun style with cars.Pro Nice gameplay Multiplayer experience is nice. The graphics for this kind of game are sweet. No bugs It is working on low end PCs also so don't worry about the specs. Simple main menu. Fast matches online which is nice that you don't have to wait hours to play 1 match. Atleast we have some kind of customization. Also the AI in this game is amazing it is a real challenge. Controller support. Very enjoyable if you play with friends that have microphones so you can talk all together. It is cross platform multiplayer meaning we can beat those console ers finally. Split Screen gameplay up to 4 players if you have some controllers to play with. Competitive.Cons Some useless graphics effects that affect the FPS. Rage quiters in ranked matches. The ranking system is kinda . I don't really know if it is based on Win/Lose idea but after you rank up in a division end lose the next game you derank that division. Why i can't ing lose one game without deranking i don't get it.,Rocket League®

2017-10-22,0,0,1910,False,Recommended,This game is not your average racing game. So much so that it's not even a racing game it's soccer (futbol). But this isn't your average soccer game either it's soccer with cars. In my opinion this is one of the best games I've ever played. I recommend if your looking to get this game to purchase the Game of The Year Edition which includes 3 DLC packs which contain 2 cars in each pack for a total of 6 cars the packs also consist of an assortment of other customization items. During sales the GOTY can go down to $15 so snag it when it's cheap. If you're looking for a fun multi player game this is the one to get. In Rocket League team work is crucial you can just pop into a match and play with a random person but communication and understanding your teammates play style is key. Whether you want to just mess around with friends or play competitively this game has it all. You can start up a party with your friends and play a private match or go online and choose between casual or competitive. Rocket League has more than just Soccer though you can play hockey with cars basketball with cars Rumble which is soccer with power ups or Dropshop which I have no clue how to describe. There are a wide assortment of maps and cars currently there are 41 cars in the PC version of the game 10 of them being cars you get by playing 20 being DLC and 11 being Import bodies that you can get by trading or opening crates. The first of my favorite aspects about this game is that it is multi player based but you can play solo in a team or play 1v1's. The second aspect I love about this game is that you are in total control of the car you can steer on the ground in the air you can jump boost fly all normal car things so first you'll need to learn how to control the car before you even get into how to play soccer. The last aspect I LOVE about this game is how original it is. Sure there are many soccer games and many driving game but who woulda thought of putting those to together the creativity in this game is intense. They could've just tried to follow the formula on how to make a game that will sell just throw some guns on a dude and have him shoot things but this game broke the mold and Psyonix truly made a masterpiece.

Play soccer with cars in 1v1 duels 2v2s 3v3s and even a chaotic 4v4. That not your cup of tea? WELL GOOD THING THERE'S MORE MODES!Try out the hoops mode. It's a 2v2 gamemode that's basketball with cars. It's my second favorite gamemode. That still not good enough for you? WELL THERE'S MORE SO SIT IN YOUR SEAT AND GET A LOAD OF THIS! There's a super crazy 3v3 mode with abilities called Rumble. I have seen some pretty crazy things happen while in Rumble and it's my favorite gamemode to this point. You can freeze punch magnetize plunger and pull yourself towards the ball. You can kick people with the shoe make them go super fast or teleport to players. It's pretty crazy. If you don't like any of those than you can try the hockey mode. I'm not a fan of it but some people like it and others don't and I'm just one of those people who don't like it. OH I FORGOT TO MENTION you can customize so much it's amazing! If your a rich kid wanting to spend money than you can customize even more with Premium things and champion crate things.

2016-09-11,0,0,18,False,Recommended,Rocket League is probably literally my favorite non story driven game I have in my entire library. I have a lot of games.This game is absolutely amazing. It's just polished SO nicely and is so smooth. I really can't think of any downsides to the game.Frontend The game looks absolutely amazing. Seriously. The aesthetics and design put into this game is incredible. It has a large variety of gamemodes and tons of features for you to customize your car. The game is fast and has almost no loading time. Many people play the game and it's so easy to meet friends or start a party with your friends and battle others online.Backend The physics in the game are handled very nicely. There's really nothing wrong with it. It's hard to believe you're lagging when the ball is still moving smoothly. The bots are pretty good. Only issue I've ever had with them is they're not so smart in season.Additionally Psyonix creators of Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket Powered Battle Cars update this game very frequently. I have recently been playing Hoops (basketball form of the game) and Snow Day (original game with a puck with little to no friction). Psyonix's most recent update adds a new gamemode called Rumble which adds powerups that you get in a certain timeframe. It's absolutely hilarious and addictively fun.I really don't have a single problem with this game. It could probably be worth $30.00.,Rocket League®

Their only online choice is to fight random players most of which seem to be pros and vets who have had the ganme since its initial release over a year ago.Any expeienced athlete knows that a n00b has to start off with other beginners and advance from there.The only other option availablke to n00bs is to play offline and for most games that is fine. However...Horribly Idotic AI's Even on hard mode the AI's lack of knowledge of how soccer actual works.No sense of what a goalie is.No sense of positions.Horribly Idotic AI's The AI's lack any sense of teamwork.A profound example AI's will intentionally ram their own teammates (users) and steal the ball from a user who is one their own team. WTF?Horribly Idotic AI's I don't mean because they lack strategy because they do.In the last 48 hours I have watched my own teammates (AI's) drive the ball across the field away from the opponent's goal and put the ball right into our goal. I have also seen my opponents do this too.I can't keep track of how many times I have seen this.Horribly Idotic AI's Seriously WTF is wrong with the game's coders and planners? Are they idiots???Didn't they test the AI's? Or did they assume the AI would work perfectly becasue they used the UT 4 engine?Would I recommend this game?No.Most of the people I know care more about gameplay and mechanics than graphics.And given how many people have gone back to 'retro gaming' I would say this is a trend.",Rocket League®

2017-05-10,0,0,316,False,Recommended,This game made me smile laugh and have such a wonderful time after such a long time. Gave me hope during a tough time of my life. I know my hours are too less but hear me out. It's been less than 48 hours since I owned the game and already have 18 hrs in not to mention I also work a 9 hour shift. This game is just too good!!!! Perfectly competitive equally entertaining and the best part is you will laugh through your defeats. It attracts all types of gamers. You will get your kicked initially though but I haven't ever seen any player talking till now. Don't take the defeats too heart enjoy the experience but keep learning the mechanics. As for the developers they are awesome. To have a growing community even after 2 years since release takes a special game and an extra special set of passionate developers behind it.Buy this game this one is worth your money and time trust me. I'm even planning to buy the dlcs which btw are only cosmetic and don't impact gameplay thus not dividing the community. Buy the dlcs to support developers like these who actually deserve it.,Rocket League®

2016-01-24,0,0,71,False,Recommended,"Hey I do know that I have not played that much on here but I believe it is not need for this game. This game is a fast paced Dream of a lifetime. I actually remember thinking of ideas like this with my friends about how I wish you could incorporate some kind of faster pace mechanic into a soccer game. This game unites a great number of players to from my friends that play fifa games to friends who just want to have some fun in some fast pace action. I especially love the fact that you cannot by your way through this because there is not way to do this. The only reason to spend money is for custimization. This also is just a entertaining to unlock and custimize my little road runner for the numerous amazing tracks that you can play on. I could not have more fun in 5 mins. Most of the time. When I do not play with my friends the game becomes not as fun because of the inability to fully communicate with my team. Is there a way to communicate with your team? yes. Does even 50% of the community use it? not really. This game again is really fun but is even more fun with friends because some people I get paired with are just not right for playing this game. I just had a game where a kid just made puking sounds and talked about how he wasn't trying. If I wanted to deal with kids not allowing me to enjoy all my time in a game I would have my own kids. I have also had plenty of games where the people playing are just plain sore losers and sore winners the whole time. I liked it when ""What I Save!"" meant you got a good save. I hate it when it is just spammed over and over from both your and opposing teams about how someone didnt come close to saving it. The Game gets a 8/10 but the community that I have played with get 3.2/10. If I wanted saltiness I would go play League of Legends.",Rocket League®

2016-06-02,0,0,774,False,Recommended,"Incredible game!I felt compelled to write a review for this game because it has quickly become my favorite. It is such a simple concept but with unlimited potential for thrills on every game especially when playing against human opponents online or locally. Highlights Highly flexible options for accommodating split screen and online players in a party or random match Physics that just ""feel right"" Player has full control of the ball in contrast to a traditional sports game like FIFA where the computer does the dribbling and you just make passes and shots Challenges and rewards the player's sense of spatial orientation (great use of a 3D environment) Potential for very simplistic run and hit playing or for spectacular aerial displays of skill Abundant vehicle customization options Workable AI and ""season"" game mode that serves as good practice The developer continually offers free content in the form of interesting gameplay modifications like basketball and hockey modes Cross platform play with XBox One and PS4 which makes for a very large pool of online opponentsThis is one of those special games that causes its players to become addicted to it and are really hard to put down once you start playing. The length of each match is long enough to enjoy but short enough to ""go for one more"" long after you intended to stop playing. Besides the loads of fun RL offers as a party game local or online it also hosts a well populated community for competitive online gaming and a ranking system that entices players to want to climb to the towards the top. Even for offline play the game provides AI opponents which although sometimes are goofy enough to score on their own goal they do provide a stiff challenge for beginner players.You cannot go wrong with this game and I highly recommend it.",Rocket League®

Although the game recommends playing with a controller keyboard is definitely playable. Although I don't have a controller myself after 5 or so hours of playing with KB I got used to it.The matches are fast ( 5 minutes ) and there are enough different gamemode types to keep you playing as well as extra car customization. Overall I would recommend this game to anybody who likes racing football or both. The community is friendly and matchmaking takes around 30 seconds tops because the game still has a very active playerbase.Thanks for reading!,Rocket League®

2016-02-18,0,0,447,False,Recommended,If you're into cars and/or sports or it into games then this is the game for you. This is one of the games anyone can pick up and start playing. Some will get really into it and play it for a thousand hours while some might just play it a few hours once in a while with their friends. Either way you will enjoy it. The essential mechanics are easy to use but extremely difficult to master which makes it a fantastic game to play over and over again.Even if you are really bad sometimes you might just get the epic goal or save and it will feel really good. Or even if you get good you will surprise yourself with skilled plays you never thought you caould make.One of the best games I've played in a long time. 5/7 Kappa,Rocket League®

I've got my Xbox360 controller for pc and love to sit on my on the couch when i want to play my sports games. This game is cheaper than most has less content than most (kind of) but as an action game fan and mostly non competitive gamer this has hit the nail on the head. Even when playing against the AI it feels like you're competing for something worthwhile with different the teams performing and reacting in their own way to get the job done at the end of the every season you choose to start. I've also only had GREAT experiences with the multiplayer matches ive had even with my crappy ping from my 3G connection in South Africa. The single player is typically there for practice for the real deal and has some serious competition of you choose the right difficulty (just try and see how deep this rabbithole goes). I've felt COMPELLED to buy each piece of DLC as these guys deserve the money. THIS WILL BE A CASUALS GATEWAY TO COMPETITIVE GAMING.,Rocket League®

This game is one of the best multiplayer games I have played in a long time and while $20 might seem like a hefty price tag it is 100% worth it.PROS Fully customizable cars Cars that can fly Multiplayer extremely fun with friends Simple party system with local and online friends Flying cars Great tutorial with different aspects of the game so you can focus on one thing you are bad at (i.e. defense offense areals etc.) Soccer but with cars Did I mention rocket powered car soccer? Competitive and amusing at the same timeCONS The occasional cancerous player but what Steam game doesn't have those? Free play is a bit limited seeing as the only thing you can do is drive around and be a loner ""Season"" mode isn't too rewarding and is kind of bland DLC doesn't really contain much only some new car types and paint for those cars only.

All of a sudden he was having a comeback with 2 minutes left 5 1 he was pushing me.. i was playing worse as the game went on conceding goal after goal and getting frustrated as to why i couldnt defend. What was happening? i kept asking myself am i seeing things.. 5 4 15 seconds to go he scores making it 5 5 i was screaming at mt T.V asking it what the f**k did i do to deserve this beads of sweat rolling down my forehead.. 3...2...1... Kick off.. We both boost at the ball.. The ball goes flying over my car.. He scores with 5 seconds to go 5 6. i throw my controller across the room A button flys out i get up and start abusing my T.V. turn my pc off and go to bed10/10 IGN would play again. but prepare your buthole for those kickoff goals. omg rip. xx,Rocket League®

2016-05-05,0,0,802,False,Recommended,"So this game is a great amount of fun I put about 30 hours int othe game my first week and I was having a blast. I would recommend this game to anyone as long as you have someone to play with.With that is where I have my issues. It was a good amount of fun at first I lost an won about an even amount of games. It changed once I hit ""Pro"" Which isn't a rank only to show you've played enough games to hit level 20. At that point all of my games changed I was placed into games against teams of either two or three and we were all singles on my team.Due to this excessive amount of games played against pre made teams I started losing more and more games. My team lacks the overall coordination the enemy team has due to a lack of effective communication. I now only win about 2 3 out of 10 games that I play.With that said I am in no way ""The best"" at this game I would say I'm average most of the time my teammates are around the same skill level I see myself as sometimes lower sometimes higher but because of the lack of communication we have it's very difficult to pull out a win.So it comes down to this if you have a few friends to play with I would highly recommend this game. It's a very fair game that relies mostly on skill and a bit of sheer luck. It's very fun but no one likes to lose constantly.I have 230 games played and am level 24 I had around a 56% win rate when I hit level 20 and earned the ""Pro"" title since then my overall win rate has dropped to 51% since then.",Rocket League®

Its also fun to play 1V1 very intensive gameplay you never know where the ball is going to land and i love that kind of feeling!The things you can put on your car dont seem to matter. I would say that it would be kinda awesome if for example you switch your old car out with the one you just got. And then i would Drive Jump or boost better )They need to make more gamemodes i really liked the one with ""Ice hokey"" where the ball was flat because then you would think about not jumping because if you jumped then you would not hit it. So after i played that i was very happy to play other gamemodes than just that one but sadly there is not any other gamemode.So all in all pretty good game!9/10",Rocket League®

Do you just browse reviews for fun? You know you aren't going to buy it if you didn't buy it two years ago so why are you hear? If you haven't heard of it I genuinely question your life choices. now you've me off. Why are you still reading? This paragraph is just wasting your precious life away by the second. Get out now. Stop reading. Tick tock the clock is ever ticking. You won't ever relive this second. Bam. It's gone. You wasted that second by reading a review for a game you already know you won't buy if you've already heard of it. If you are buying it what took you so long? Oh my god you read so much of this. .... You could've had an aneurysm just then. Then you would've died reading a long review for a two year old game. How would that make the people around you feel? Friends? Family? Do you even have those? My god honestly just just stop. You are gonna hit a picture of somebody masturbating pretty soon if you don't. Tick tock the seconds tick by. Tick. That second is gone. Tock. That second is gone. It's so sad how you choose to spend your precious time. You could be in Paris seeing the Eiffel Tower. You could be in the Galapagos Islands seeing the most interesting life on this Earth. You are reading this. I hope this motivates you to get out there and enjoy life. Because in reality we have so little time and the time keeps slipping. Please take this as an important lesson to enjoy life. Don't play Rocket League. it. This is a negative review now. Enjoy your life away from a computer. See the world. Canada Germany Peru and New Zealand are all there as are so many others. But then again the best way to enjoy life is to do what you want. If its playing Rocket League or WOW or anything else. Do that. Do what makes you happy. You could want to see the world so what's stopping you? You could just want to play Rocket League so what are you reading this for? Christ almighty go and do you. This is a positive review. Buy it to enjoy your life. I need to take my own advice as well. Why did I write this review I could've just played Rocket League instead. Go away and live life however you may see it to be appropriate. Enjoy the life given to you.

2016-11-25,0,0,437,False,Recommended,Rocket League is probebly the best game i have paid money for/installed the fact that when you start you have no disadvantage exept your skill. this makes gamplay fair and since this game cannot be hacked (if it could what hack?)(boost) but can be mastered with time. it all depends on reactions and just plain skill.The fact that when you start you dont have to upgrade say the boost amount means it is completly fair no way to blame anything when you loose.This game makes football seem cool to a person who doesn't really like it.this game will apeal to alot of people and for the money it is completly worth it.The updates bring great thing (rumble) and that means constant intrest and even without them its still a game to love.Now Go Practice,Rocket League®

2017-05-05,0,0,0,False,Recommended,Product received for free. When you have just started playing this game you can feel the electric rushing through your veins every time you touch the ball. It's a really heartwarming feeling and it makes you happy to some weird extent.The game has a really bad concept cars playing football but the developers were able to execute the game so well to the point that I might even consider playing it for the long run.However I would not recommend this game to the people who have no friends that own this game. If so you would just end up grinding and raging. It's a fun game with a fun concept so it is better to play this game with friends.Also the developers need to tweak the cameras a little bit to optimize the users' gaming experience.I rate this 7/10 not because it sucks but just because it does not fit my preference.,Rocket League®

Fun as heck made for insane and spastic weirdos cars do acrobatics galore etc. What is not to love? But then came the mutators update and my love grew substantially! Customizable stuff is my one true love in all games! Sandbox creative mode customizers all of these are my favorite things in games. So this allowed me to really get crazy and have loads of fun. I already have done many videos for youtube of the game and now I find it difficult to reimmerse myself back into Season mode because of the chaos that is created with the mutators. Honestly there really is nothing to dislike about this game and everything to love. If you want a unique simplistic yet chaotic and fun game this is the game you need right now!,Rocket League®

Whoever you are you might as well go to the curators because if you've come for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place. However if you have come for an outstanding chocolate chip cookie recipe you've come to the right place. Ingredients1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter3/4 cup packed dark brown sugar3/4 cup sugar2 large eggs1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract1 (12 ounce) bag semisweet chocolate chips or chunks2 1/4 cups all purpose flour3/4 teaspoon baking soda1 teaspoon fine saltDirections1. Evenly position 2 racks in the middle of the oven and preheat to 375 degrees F. (on convection setting if you have it.) Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone sheets. (If you only have 1 baking sheet let it cool completely between batches.)2. Put the butter in a microwave safe bowl cover and microwave on medium power until melted. (Alternatively melt in a small saucepan.) Cool slightly. Whisk the sugars eggs butter and vanilla in a large bowl until smooth.3. Whisk the flour baking soda and salt in another bowl. Stir the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients with a wooden spoon take care not to over mix. Stir in the chocolate chips or chunks.4. Scoop heaping tablespoons of the dough onto the prepared pans. Wet hands slightly and roll the dough into balls. Space the cookies about 2 inches apart on the pans. Bake until golden but still soft in the center 12 to 16 minutes depending on how chewy or crunchy you like your cookies. Transfer hot cookies with a spatula to a rack to cool. Serve.5. Store cookies in a tightly sealed container for up to 5 days.For a Rocky Road Bar 1. Lightly butter a 9 by 13 inch baking pan. Make the batter as per cookie recipe and fold in 1 cup chopped walnuts along with the chocolate chips. Spread batter in prepared pan. Bake until the edges are light brown and the batter sets about 45 minutes. Cool slightly and cover surface with 4 cups marshmallows and 1 cup chocolate chips. Broil at least 8 inches from the heat until marshmallows turn golden brown about 2 minutes. (Keep an eye on the marshmallows and turn the pan frequently they go from golden to char in a wink.) Cool cut and serve.,Rocket League®

You just need to try it.The Game has just one big problem and these are the smurfs if u get in ""winning streak"" (just 2 or 3 games needed) you get 1 or 2 smurfs as enemies. You cant rank up so. If Psyonix fix this the game is just unstoppable.",Rocket League®
2016-05-20,0,0,235,False,Recommended,The best innovative game i have ever seen. Mixing cars with football / basketball is really very creative.I don't see any reason for not buying this game if you like football.At first you only drive around the ball like crazy after you learn how to hit the ball properly aim properly fly properly fly and hit properly fly and aim and hit properly. When you can fly properly you become veteran already.Enjoy will reach it's climax when you realize actual difference of this game and a normal football game )Let's go to the like/dislike/pro/cons/bugs ( no bugs because i couldn't find any serious bugs. )Things i like Matchmaking system The matchmaking system is based on your hidden mmr ( there are different ranked and normal game mmr ) That means you will be likely to match with a bit better or a bit worse than you. Menu For FPS testers like me main menu has the same render ratios with the game itself. Adjusting video setting is very easy compared to the other games. Menu Menu is quiet simple and straightforward nothing unneccessary. Game physics The first thing you except to be good from a game like this would be physics. And this game has good physics. No weird ball moves no weird car noclip action. As excepted from Unreal Engine. No serious penalty for leaving the game. You get no penalty in normal game. If you leave a ranked game it will count as loss.Things i don't like When you join a server and not every slot is filled you enter a free play mode which you can play with the ball freely before the game starts. But when every slot is occupied free mode is closed and you wait for every people to connect. That oftenly lasts around 15 second. If a player with poor connection comes that becomes more than 20 seconds. For a game which has 5 min playtime 15 seconds are worth considering. I want to exit the free mode when all players are ready to play not just ready to connect.Pros There is no difference between a mere buyer and well paid player. If you have talent you are good. If you are trained enough you are good. Nothing is based on money. Absolutely nothing. All cars have same speed same jump ratio and vice versa. Only hitboxes are different. Fast development Much way to customize your car. You can adjust every single detail of camera Almost no blunder bugs. Games last 5 mins if you are quickshotter this game is for you. Good community. I almost didn't encounter with trolls or toxic players. Too many rooms to improve yourself. Only 1 con i could think of )Cons When the time is over match ends when ball falls to the ground. No matter where it is. Yeah the game will be over even if you are 0.1 second close to score. I love the game but i call this t. Game should be over when the ball leaves the penalty box and falls to the ground.When just learnt to fly anybody would fly to the ball and score a very nice own goal 9 / 10 ),Rocket League®

Challenges to complete to get the new reward. Also the ability to after the online game ends. Too be able to click and view each players Steam page too add them to your friends list and what not. Say you play one game with a player on your team and keep going on and on for another 6 games but you have to get off but you wanna keep playing with him?

2016-08-06,0,0,75,False,Recommended,"I am not into sports or into online competitive games for that matter. I play single player I like a story....With that said Rocket League is super fun and addictive. Cars with rockets playing soccer...yeah it's that fun.The community is very mature (...uh...in the sense of ""having been playing a while "" not in terms of behavior) so it can be daunting as a newbie to get involved especially if you're just here for fun and have no desire to become ueber awesome. Still it's super fun and you can just ignore the trash talkers trying to spoil your good time. Definitely more fun with friends but still fun solo.I've played with keyboard+mouse and with a controller. IMO the controller didn't add much except for allowing local split screen multiplayer. The ""analog stick"" didn't actually behave analog y and yielded no finer control than just pressed WASD.If you have a Mac you'll want to run this in Windows via Bootcamp not in OS X via the Wine wrapper you might find online.

2015-07-07,0,0,21,False,Recommended,You have no idea how many time i passed playing the prequel on my ps3 with my friends and even 1 or 2 years later we would still play it without getting bored even though we would have loved a sequel! Years have passed since our last match but today out of nowhere while i was on the store page i saw this! Within the first screenshot i immediately understood what this game was and i bought it. SO MANY FEELS! I love it! I searched the first one on steam so many times somewhere somehow i wanted to play it on PC since i switched to pc gaming but i found nothing until now... At a first glance it seems like the first one enhanced like an awesome more detailed with everything better version but i just tried the free mode so basically i saw nothing of the game. But STILL! Even if it ends up being just a super enhanced version of the prequel (really improbable) it would still be one of the funniest game you'd ever play! Buy it you will have a lot of fun and if you play it with your friend in local or online... you will never play anything else again this game is the 100/10 Another thing i want to say about the game is the existing local co op . So many games on pc have only the online multiplayer but this is one of the good ones with the local for you and your friends thanks there still are good developers out there.,Rocket League®

2015-11-02,0,0,418,False,Recommended,This has got to be one of the most addictive games i've played. Easy enough for a beginner to pick up and have a good time but complex enough that after 100+ hours of gameplay I'm nowhere near one of the best nor can i do all of the cool tricks you can find people doing on youtube (or occasionally see in game). As time goes on you'll find yourself going from only playing on the ground to climing the walls to hit a ball or use boost to fly and hit a ball near the roof.It's meant to be played online and that's where it excels. you can play anywhere from 1v1 to 3v3 in ranked matches. unranked also has a 4v4 mode. There is however an offline mode that you can use for practice but that's really all it's good for.you get the occasional prick who takes the game way too seriously but the overall community is very great as well.only down sides that i would like to see fixed is the occasional crash (very rare) as well as the ranking system.while the ranking system is decent and overall does a good job it would be nice to be able to gain rank points despite a loss if you put in a really good performence. have those points you earn in the game itself mean something in the ranking system if you score enough of them to overcome the points lost due to a loss. maybe at 500 points or so have no loss in ranking points even if you lose the game.,Rocket League®

The charm of the game wears off very quickly but there is so much more to the game that it doesn't matter. (Within 1 hour of gameplay you're sick of watching your lame goals.)

2015-08-17,0,0,70,False,Recommended,At first glance this game obviously looks really cool. I mean it's Soccer. With cars. The thing is eventually more and more people and Youtubers start playing it and then I at least had a few second thoughts. It was seeming to be one of those games that a ton of Youtubers play and is really popular. For about a week until everyone ends up hating it. (I'm sure some great examples came into your head. Not going to name any specifics c ) Anyways after playing the game it seems that isn't the case. The concept really does last and has some surprising depth to it. This is one of those games that is very repetitive but always fun. It's the kind of game that can have you playing the exact same thing over and over and not get bored. The thing is it isn't the exact same thing. That's why people play it. In hopes that the next match they'll win or get an achievement or do some cool trick or maybe just have fun. So all in all this game seems to be the game that everyone wants but nobody has as many of my friends among many other people really want this game but are a bit intimidated by the price tag. Honestly if you really think the game looks cool and want to try it out I'd say go for it. It's a fun game. At it's core it's soccer a sport which hasn't gotten old among other sports for hundreds or even thousands of years. If I had to summarize this game in one word I'd just say... fun. Whether you're playing online offline etc. There's still enjoyment to be had. I feel this game is at it's best when you're on a team where you can really cooperate with your teammates perhaps essentially getting some friends getting on Skype and taking on the world. Or have your friends split up to fight each other? Anyways the game at first may seem difficult to grasp and it might seem that you'll never get much better but it kind of happens. I was at a point where I didn't see how I could actually get better. There wasn't really anything I could learn. I knew how to do everything I was just a bit inexperienced not the best at timing etc. I thought I really couldn't get much better yet I've slowly been able to beat better players. This was quite a long a bit off topic and slightly redundant review but if you read it props to you. xD Anyways to wrap it up if you truly want to know whether or not this game is for you the only way to know is to play it. ) (Besides Steam refunds are a thing now just in case.),Rocket League®

2016-06-06,0,0,721,False,Recommended,I've spent a total of 480 hours in this game on steam and since the xbox release probably put another 150 hours in. I'm just here to say that if you have $20 to spend and have a competitive itch that you can't seem to fix then look no furhter than rocket league. Since the introduction into cross platform play with PS4 and now Xbox they variety of skill level and the amount of playerw on the servers is tremendous. It was sinking close down to about 50k or lower on high traffic hours but at night it would go down to about 30k. But after the xbox and ps4 additions its around 110 120k on high traffic hours and around 65 70k around the later hours.To wrap things up this is by far my favorite indie/casual game in the world. When I purchased I was just looking for a game to play in between work and school but it has now taken over most of my free time and probably became one of my top 3 game of all time. 10/10 Would recommend to everyone but it might not be everyone's cup of tea.

2017-09-09,0,0,928,False,Recommended,Amazing game Pretty much everything about this game is great. The game is easy to pick up and play casually alone or with friends but is very hard to master. After 500+ hours on PC and around 800 900 on PS4 I can still guarantee that I will not stop playing Rocket League for quite some time. Pros Easy to pick up hard to master Exciting gameplay through a variety of gamemodes from normal 1v1 to 4v4 or non standard modes like rumble hoops dropshot and more. Progress through ranks in competitive modes of 1v1 2v2 or 3v3 and get rewards for your accomplishments at the end of a competitive season. Deep car costomization with dozens of cars decals toppers antennas and much more. Player to player trading allows you to trade items you don't need to get items you want. Many different training modes. Practise on others' or create your own training packs. Season and other offline modes allow you to practise against bots. Save replays of matches where you feel like you played very well or scored an amazing goal or save to rewatch again from different angles speeds and show your friends. Crossplay between platforms makes match queues very short thanks to the massive playerbase. Frequent updates to the game adds new features and improves on old ones. Cons Sometimes toxic playerbase. When trading you may encounter many scammers. As long as you have common sense you shouldn't be able to fall victim to a scam. Can be frustrating at times when you lose a lot or teammates play really bad. Learning curve is sometimes very steep. Becoming consistent in your play at the same time as trying to learn new techniques can be overwhelming at times.I can't really find any more cons and I might have missed some obvious ones but nonetheless it's an amazing game worth a try. I'd give it a 9/10 it's great and the only real flaw in the game I see is how the matchmaker and competitive points works but I am sure that's something that's going to be improved as the devs gather more feedback and data. It's not really something that will matter anyways for most ),Rocket League®

2015-08-27,0,0,328,False,Recommended,"Great game and a lot of fun I have very few complaints about the game. One of them is that it seems the game is running 1/2 a second slower than what it is displaying. In a game where everyone is sub 50 ping the replay of a goal never looks exactly like the shot you lined up theres something wrong.The second issue is that the front part of the car was given some kind of physics defying kick boost to make it work properly. This is not an issue for the ball but if you tap a play you can send them halfway across the map with very little boost invested (just a tap before you hit). This kick property shouldn't apply to hitting other cars.Cars are all speed locked which is fine and to some extent the ball speed is as well... UNLESS you do something called a pinch which brings the ball to hit the frontend ""kick zone"" of your car in which it will move anywhere from double to three times the max car speed this should not be a thing.",Rocket League®

2017-02-08,0,0,1192,False,Recommended,"I can't imagine needing to even write a review for this game. It's reputation already stands firm in the gaming community. It's an amazing game with an incredibly high skill ceiling and deep mechanics.What I can offer are a few pieces of advice/information Pros 1) Can be played for 10 minutes or 4 hours straight. Matches are quick.2) Extremely high replayability lots of achievements collectibles playlists practice challenges and user made content.3) Very easy to play with friends.4) Beautiful graphics (although I will say there is weird stuttering sometimes that Psyonix has not admitted to R9 390 no issues with other AAA games...)5) Very addictive game. Super fun to play and like a great sports game some moments are epic!Cons 1) If you play alone be prepared for a community that is made of many ""next big superstars"" who will criticize you even when something was their fault. This is really an issue with any competitive game in 2017 and I will admit is a low blow.2) Even though you can play against/with PS4 players there is no real way to communicate other than pre set ""quick phrases"". I find this very annoying also you cannot befriend them.3) Servers Random lag even with proper port forwarding open NAT and fast internet. The rubber banding will happen not all the time though. Lag is an issue because this is a reaction/skill based game.4) I hate to say this but honestly Psyonix's matchmaking algorithm needs work. You will be stuck at a certain rank (playing without a dedicated teammate) because you get paired with the worst players 3 games then decent players 3 4 games which just leaves you in limbo for perpetuity. I'm serious when I say this. This matters because if you want cool wheels and stuff that are rewards for matchmaking you need higher ranks. I'm not talking about the top ranks either. Someone with an MMR (hidden ""skill"" value) of 600+ should not be stuck in challenger III forever due to teammates. You should be placed on teams with people of very similar MMR. When there's 20 000 people in the same playlist I'm sure it's possible to match people better.These cons are not really a big deal until you get ""ok"" at the game and reach a middle ish skill level where things are extremely hit and miss. They also do NOT break the game and I still play all the time (and I play many games).",Rocket League®

You can literally just pick up a controller (so to speak) and just have hours of fun. It is so simple you will get used to it in a couple minutes there is quite simply 3 commands Drive Boost and Jump. After you have got those down you will learn to control the car in the car get the right projectile to aim strait for the ball and get it in.(may I add the level of satisfaction you'll have is immense.So what are you waiting for...,Rocket League®

2017-08-14,0,0,389,False,Recommended,Ah. Cars with rockets and soccer. What a good combination.The title literally describes what the game is. You have controllable cars that you use to send the ball towards the opponent's goal. Combined with rockets allows for insane movement that can send you flying and do cool tricks when scoring goals.The game can be played online or offline. You have two options when playing online casual and competitive. Casual doesn't focus on ranks and instead moves you to a good server to play on even when the game has already started. This is a good option for practice. Competitive is just like any other competitive game you start a new match and try your best to go up in ranks. Casual and Competitive share the same 4 modes which include Solo (1v1) Doubles (2v2) Solo Standard (3v3 but no queue in party) and Standard (3v3 with queue in party). Casual contains other fun gamemodes like Hoops Hockey Rumble and more.The community on this game is very pleasant and continues to rub away toxic players. The developers on this game regularly hear community feedback and continue to make improvements to the game. The game has a decent ban system and removes the negativity with its word filter. You are also allowed to spam in game chat (which you can easily disable chat from the settings) that adds to the fun of the community.The game doesn't dissapoint with its visuals. It has great shaders realistic grass (WOAH!) and bloom that is incredibly strong. Visuals doesn't look too great on its minimum settings however and causes some rendering issues but I guess that is a problem with having a mid tier computer.The servers aren't great however and sometimes you can get matched on a server with 80 ping (and is considered good by Rocket League (?)). The ball can sometimes miscalculate on the clientside and server synchronization isn't great when matched on bad ping. Not to mention you can also easily drop out from the game if you have some packet loss. Sometimes the game cannot start because players fail to connect to the servers. This is probably the worst aspect of the game.Overall if you can live with the horrid matchmaking servers and love to play soccer with a little twist on it get this. It doesn't get extremely addicting but it's fun to play every once in a while.,Rocket League®

2015-08-15,0,0,7,False,Recommended,I originally thought it would be somewhat of a standard soccer game. But after playing online matches and getting the hang of it it's become so much more fun than I've anticipated! The controls have somewhat of a learning curve but after that it gets easier to handle.My only problem is that there are still some bugs involved with the game. Online connectivity actually affects the match with someone's connection pulling everyone on the team or even on the field down.Overall I highly recommend this game. It's great for passive fun!*Edit Originally thought there was a bug regarding the decals turns out there are only some decals that work with certain car bodies. Also I'd like to add that there is a problem with the DLC soundtrack which despite purchasing it is nowhere to be found.,Rocket League®

2015-08-27,0,0,197,False,Recommended,"Rocket League is an amazing game! Well worth the $20.00 price tag. It has a perfect learning curve with room to always grow and become a better player. It's better with friend or at least people you meet that you play well with. Even a 2 vs 2 game can be a tad frustrating when you're not on the same page as your teammate. A lot of unlockables customization and enough cars to choose from. They've also already added DLC to add more add ons and even 2 awesome new cars. (DLC was $5.00 and well worth it.) The only problem I've been having is when I have a great game with another player or players and after the game I will *Shift Tab* to bring up the list in which shows ""Players""/""Recent Games"" to see who I'd just played with. Maybe because it's a cross platform game I am unable to see this. Although I've had a couple people add me I have yet to do so.

2015-10-26,0,0,43,False,Recommended,Rocket league is just fun pure and simple. It takes ideas from an existing sport and impliments them into a game about rocket propelled cars who's sole purpose is to hit a ball into a goal. It's well executed and incredibly addicting. Definitely one to start up at a LAN party. The gameplay never gets old and it's a romp to play with friends. The presentation the optimization and gameplay make this a must own. Rocket League comes highly recommended.10/10 in my book.&lt 3,Rocket League®

Generally expect the same game expirience in every game. Nothing ever changes. Balls are tossed around and you either win or lose thats all. Unless youre a quick learner you'll find yourself constantly driving around in circles trying to hit the ball while surrounded by a bunch of high leveled people that rip your nuts off if you aren't of high expertease.,Rocket League®

2016-11-25,0,0,953,False,Recommended,"I'm not gonna give you the regular spiel about the game modes general information and all that crap you can google that.Car soccer. Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket Powered Battle Cars. I'm sure this game gets a lot of ridicule because of its unconventional and rather odd design but rocket league is what an ideal game should be like. Very fun with friends and easy to understand and play but have a exceptionally high skill cap (I'd even say its one of the hardest games I've ever played). I got into this game because a couple of friends wanted to try the new game on steam by buying a four pack it seemed cool at the time. Everyone in comms getting excited over scoring a goal but after playing for a decent amount of time I've realized that asides from being ridiculously exciting at times this game can be absolutely gorgeous when you really start dedicating time to it. Pulling crazy tight angles on a shot crippling an opponent with mind games and doing things that people could have never imagined to be possible is what really makes this game. Youtube is filled with Rocket Leauge montages and they are just a glympse of what your muscle memory and this game is capable of. The community is ever evolving in the first competative season the apex of skill was comparable season 5's Platinums. I'm sure theres tons of stuff tricks and techniques that we haven't even discovered and as a community we're a long way from mastering the game. And of course the wonderful community a mixture of PC xbox and PS4 based conglomerate. And one thing they all have in common is their What a save! bind. Yes the players can be toxic yes they get frustrated and insult their teammates and want to forfeit 10 seconds into the game but thats all games out there. Its probably ones of the least appealing parts about the game but its something you have to learn to deal with. But dont get me wrong there are tons of players who are willing to laugh at mistakes and provide actual criticism but those are of course a rare find. The mutes reside at the top of this hierarchy.And yes this game does have microtransactions solely for cosmetic purposes. And some might argue even for slightly advantageous purposes by buying DLC cars which ""perform better"" but thats really not the case. The cars are all personal choices. It all depends on what you feel comfortable it I recommend starting off with the cars that you think you like visually speaking and then refine your taste by trying out the other ones. The microtransactions themselves are not that big of an issue its great for gamblers who get a big boner out of spinning the wheel or even those people who never play the game but just love stock trading simulations. Oh and apparently in the new update they will be introducing a method to accure purchase only items for players who dont want to spend money. More on that in the future.Asides from that solid game cheap fun competative trolly Idunno its in neat. These guys psyonix had been sitting on a damn gold mine and all they had to do is make it look a bit a nicer and boom one of the top grossing games on steam. Cuz yanno this isnt the first game its a continuation of their indie action/thriller Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket Powered Battle Cars real great story memorable characters youre not missin much but oh boy someone messed up in product design with that bloated ing name.",Rocket League®

2016-06-11,0,0,42,False,Not Recommended,Pros the idea itself is great game mechaincs and controls are good you start with all basic cars unlocked and only get cosmetics for playing so no performance increase &gt it's fair you can make playsCons matchmaking is broken (the wait is too much for a 5 minute game sometimes insane ping(300ms+) and sometimes i have to wait for minutes sitting alone/almost alone on a server) in general you only get into a game by the time matchmaking is considering ALL skill levels and this usually leads to unbalanced matches the community is disappointing in randoms (toxic people leavers)Verdict If you are a solo player don't buy it but if you got some friends to play with you shoud consider it escpecially when it's on sale.,Rocket League®

Dont get me wrong. the game can be fun. there is a rare 5 minutes where you get matched with an equal skilled player. after that you will go right back to feeling robbed or 20 dollars. fun can be had if you have friends to play with. but if you plan to play alone plan to be dissapointed.,Rocket League®

2016-04-23,23,126,1,False,Not Recommended,I love this game. Played it while it was free. SO. MUCH. FUN. But I can't recommend it particularly for Iranians like me. This game won't work for you. Rocket League blocks their servers in Iran. It can't connet unless you're using a proxy which will increase the ping to uplayble levels. So if you don't live in the handful of countries who are boycotted by RL servers by all means buy this game it's awesome and fun! But I won't and never will since I can't play it in its current state unless they allow Iran to use servers.,Rocket League®

2016-06-03,0,0,50,False,Recommended,Rocket league is a game based on the concept of football however it adds cars to the mix instead of players and has a wider range of ways to defend and attack as well as save those all important shots.This game is not the quickest game youll ever learn as i myself have played only 7.5 hours and have only scored a total of 6 goals therefore you can see how much of a grind it can be well actually its not a grind because its not boring it is actually very fun if you have friends as in the start you will find the game very frustrating without the teaching of a well expirenced friend so you should always find one.If you put many hours into rokkie and pro traning for goal striker and arieal you should find your self catching on to how to play the game in no time.Having this advanced training in the movement system of this game will help you in the long run.I think that this is a well crafted game with great gameplay and a great concept so i give this game a 7 out of 10.,Rocket League®

2015-07-19,0,0,127,False,Recommended,"My skills in football games such as Fifa involve accidently shooting to tackle someone and then doing a slide tackle dribble to take a shot at goal from behind the half way line. In fact my real life football is barely any better (although I am the king of toe punts). My skills in PC games are perhaps demonstrated by me taking a screenshot and posting it if I beat a friend suggesting for those of you with U grade English that a win is very rare. So maybe a football PC game wasn't the best idea?This doubt in both my own idea and the idea of a friend who thought it might be a game I could actually be in the top 90% in was further confirmed to me when I bought the game on Steam rather than so that I could request a refund if the game wasn't to my ear wax loving Asian food loathing taste.7 hours of gameplay later Rocket League is continuing to entertain me. While occasionally the server lags to take in my OPness and my car sometimes fails to move for a few seconds (next time I'll check the service history before buying) the game on the whole is great and I would thoroughly reccomend it.In fact the game now reckons I'm a ""semi pro"" which while it's an honour to receive such a prestigious award also scared me as the prospect of playing people who weren't noobs was to me a mix between London Dungeons and falling from a ladder (after somebody walked underneath it) to an early grave. Luckily the game seems much the same as before and the sky has only turned black after 9pm.The ""semi pro"" status does however confirm to me that I am in that top 90% and perhaps this is my game. Many reviews rave about the novelty of doing a scissor kick in a car. I may have done one myself but I am not entirely sure what a scissor kick is despite trying to simulate it with some left handed safety scissors and a nut (the food not the other sort for anyone who is accusing me of castration). Anyway before my mind digresses further...Rocket League is one of the best games on Steam in my opinion and I would thoroughly reccomend it to anybody who is blind and only has one arm so that I can get a few more wins thanks! )",Rocket League®

2017-07-23,0,0,707,False,Not Recommended,"Honestly I don't recommend this game and I am tired of it. So much so that I'll be uninstalling it.For starters the performance is abismal on Mac OS I never saw an update that addressed the performance issues present on this operating system. Before the general update (for everyone) that resolved the problems on the Aquadome map that was absolutely unplayable on Mac OS now it is just bad. Lots of people have server issues not being able to join matches sudden lag spikes and general random disconnects. This has never been worse that it is now. They don't care.The matchmaking and ranking systems are still broken and don't allow for a natural progression that accomodates for the improvement in skill of the players.The last update introduced terrible changes in controls/UI. To join a match you select the categories you want to join on matchmaking and then press the start button or the A/X on the xbox/playstation controller but there such a delay that sometimes it doesn't even register or register twice and you end accidentally adding a second player.People often say that they buy keys or the dlc to support the developers of this game I don't agree or think it is a good idea. Their lootbox system is even more exploitive than the ones implemented in other more criticised games like overwatch and etc. You have to play many hours to receive a random lootbox you have to buy keys to unlock the lootbox. Which have not a trivial price but a high price. And then when opening said lootbox with a purchased key you are subject to a random but weighted (which means that some prizes have a much lower probability of appearing than others) process that determines your prize.Furthermore these prizes are not only of cosmetic value they also unlock cars which technically are ""characters"" in this game and each one have different characteristics and stats meaning that effectively you have to pay to play as certain ""characters"".This is the reason I don't recommend this game anymore although I have played it for many hours (with increasing frustration).",Rocket League®

2017-01-29,0,0,302,False,Not Recommended,This game is a litteral waste of time if you want to play a game for more than a few minutes straight with no downtime. You better be ready to do a whole lot of waiting almost as much as playing in some cases. Here's a quick list of what I want to see before I can recommend this game to a friend. 1. Skip replays whenever 50% or more of the players want to skip it. There's always that one guy who doesn't press the button. Screw him. In a 5 minutes match 6 replays at 10 seconds per replay that's 1 minute. Litterally 20% of my time is spent watching replay. Wtf.2. Whenever a team forfeits end the match immediatly just like before. Once again a 10 seconds replay is just a waste of my time to go through when one team has already surrendered. 3. Another 10 seconds can be saved if I can start looking for new matches immediatly rather than looking at the winning team's car. I don't want to look at my car I don't want to look at my teammates' cars and I certainly don't want to looke at the other team's cars. 4. While waiting for a new match especially in competitive play put people that are looking for a match in a free play ring. I'm playing competitive... I want to get better... This is what I got to do now to go into free play Match ends. Wait for replay. Wait for cars dancing. Find match. Exit to Main Menu. Wait for main menu. Scroll down. Hit Training. Hit Free Play. Either make it automatic or make it a button right under Find match. 5. Speaking of Free Play remove unlimited boost. I hear that's how it was a long time ago. If I go into free play to practice it's not doing me any favors to practice aerials and such as I won't have unlimited boost in a match and I won't know how far I can or can't go. 6. In Solo play it feels like face offs are essentially 50 50. Make a tool for practice or fix the face offs. 7. While in a party while not the leader just gray out the Find Match option. I shouldn't be able to hit find match much less search if I can't find a match. Not only that but if you forget and do it anyway by mashing A a pop up comes up to tell you that you can't do that. Just gray out Find match. 8. Speaking of pop ups MAKE THEM DISMISSABLE BY PRESSING B. That's just common sense wtf.,Rocket League®

2016-12-06,0,0,217,False,Not Recommended,Obviously a very popular game the idea is fantasticly simple and fun. Unfortunately what really lets it down is how laggy online games can be. I'm in the UK and I throw a lot of money at my internet connection yet a significant portion of the games are just so dissapointing due to constant lag glitching. Don't get me wrong you will get games where everyone has a decent ping and you get a fantasticly responsive game out of it but there are far more games in which you will find players yourself and the ball glitching around the arena like in games from the dial up era.If the match finder had a way to filter out people with slow connections then I would definitely recommend this game unfortunately the best you can do is filter by region so you are always going to get matched with kids playing on terrible broadband wirelessly forty feet from their routers with several walls sitting between them.,Rocket League®

Mose players respect others and play fairly and apologize and then are accepted by their teamates for mishaps. In some cases though I have witnessed players become harrassed and antagonized by others who play in the game with them. Oftenly disabling of chat and muting sometimes is not enough. Oftenly my friends and aquaintences say that they are often messaged after games with horrid comments from said ""evil"" ""unfriendly"" ""uncooperative"" players. Yes kicking features should be deemed from a concept of excessive comments that are profane rude or offensive to others. Also a in favor rule of team members wanting to remove players from their team must be considered in a vote as much as penalty functions against the opposing team. Perhaps maybe a inclusion to where opposite teams with ""evil"" players may prohibit those players from aquiring the needs to destroy other players vehicles. These features need to be added in for the reinstitution of old players who had left and give more reason for new players to join.",Rocket League®

It does not match you with players at your own level you can for example face a player with level Master in a like the silver league 1v1 while the other player is in Gold or higher in 3vs3 or 2vs2 which makes this game really unfair at some points.....,Rocket League®

Like me and my flipsy flopsy internet that is really I can only play in my region any other region and i'll get disconnected from having 1000 ping.With that aside timing is key to the game as well as skill strategy and teamwork.

2016-08-05,0,0,1302,False,Recommended,Firstly my responce to this game is that it could be the new game that i will be playing for a while and yes i have been. (only because i don't know what else to play) This game lacks developer support as it was promised common updates when it recieves updates so slowly and the developers really still have no idea how to keep the game interesting. I mean come on adding allot of non ranked content? ing t everyone plays for the ranking system. The devs are a bunch of dumb s who add one map to the ranking system. I personally think this game needs allot more gamemodes and larger player teams to keep the fun going. Yes i know i have allot of hours but that is only because of summer and having nothing else to play because the gaming industry is and has no creativity and the only creativity they have is when someone posts a scam early access game that never follows through.

I know my ISP is really bad (Etisalat Telecomunications) but comparing the latency between Rocket League and Overwatch for example I always get a consistent ping in Overwatch opposed to what I get in Rocket League.

Edit7 Recently for me and many other middle east players are facing rubber banding where the car jumps erratically not like ordinary lag and it is happening wether my ping is 10ms or 200ms unale to play at all.. when I searched everywhere the makers of the game are saying it is not their problem it is the end user's problem. bare in mind I play Overwatch WoW HotS Speed Runners (fun game) and many many other online games that has no issue but fromt he point of view of psyonix it is my mistake that their servers are crap or whatever they got happening is wrong it is me to blame the end user... you know if they demand a monthly subscription I will be willing to pay if I will get the same level of connection quality like World of Warcraft and blizzard games.. really... I will play.. it is an amazing game but for some reason it is my fault for it not being able to run good on my 100mbps connection (not bragging cause I know it is not as fast as many other so trolls please stay away!) ... I did all the stuff mentioned in their troubleshooting FAQ and zero solution worked.Note I think the more I complain something happens that makes my account unable to que or join games.... hmmmmmph I wonder why.,Rocket League®

And the game is filled to the rim with people being so salty it actually makes you wonder how the person breathe. The matchmaking system is really not that well done. You get matched with people above and under your own rank. You (1) get ranked with people way better than yourself(2) You smash people because you get ranked with people way low than you Rocket League is addicting as fast. But it plays with your temper and when you keep loosing and hear salty players inbetween it makes you wanna do crazy stuff. The game pisses you the off pretty much. I like this game but the matchmaking in this game is way to stupid. I don't know what causes this. I use my brain. I know how psyhics works. When a ball hit a wall at a certain angle i know how it bounces off again. But some people have no idea how that works. Some people go for shots that you went for.

2017-12-13,0,0,1555,False,Not Recommended,Fun game but I'm selling off all my stuff after they implemented the filter banning. There's no reason they couldn't have just added a language filter anyone could check if they are sensitive to such things and then they'd never see it instead of filtering for language and automatically banning people who used it. I understand people like to be pushy and authoritarian with what comes out of peoples mouths but practices like this just box people in and ultimately make for a very boring environment. You may disagree with what people say right now but what is considered politically correct is constantly changing and it won't be long before nobody cares what you think is right or wrong and they've moved on to something else. Just ask the christians. Ultimately things like this just stifle creativity and foster corporate mediocrity and stagnation. May as well leave now.

Seems a bit counter intuitive to have those options if in the end you'll just be banned for it anyways. These developers are over sensitive or maybe it's just the fanboys. Still waiting on a vote kick option/report option for AFK's that just farm loot crates. And the ban timer doesn't start to coun't down from when it was implemented until you've actually launched up Rocket Leauge so you can't call it a 24 hour ban when in reality it's longer. That's false advertising.Decent game but it has some of the worst match making I've ever seen in a multiplayer game. Even after the ""Autumn update"" they have not improved it.1) Joining matches that already ended.2) Joining a match that already started and you're on the losing team.3) Joining matches where your team is half AI while the opposite team is 4 people and there's no auto balancing to fix it.4) AI is brain dead on your team unless there's 2 or more.5) Being put up against tryhards that have over 1000 hours in the game while you're new and also your team (rookies).6) Too many different game modes and team size matches instead of having less to minimize join times.7) No ""ping limits"" on servers or ""region locked"" servers so be prepared to see 200+ pingers on your/opposing teams.8) Lots of rage quitters.9) Having AFK's on your team and sometimes they're clearly there since they never get auto kicked for staying idle because they move a little and refuse to play.9) Sometimes you have to wait a long time to join a match with their crappy ""auto matchmaking"" and it's worse when you have one of the problems mentioned above.10) No server browsing list it's all ""auto matchmaking.""11) No vote kick option to kick griefers/AFK's.12) Being forced to watch a ""Goal Cam"" for every single goal because no one ever votes to skip when it should be a majority rules kinda thing.13) Being put up against the same people over and over again even though it says there's 10 000 or more people in that same game mode...14) The server doesn't wait for a full 4v4 or 3v3 and starts with Ai on your team while the enemy team is full human players. No autobalancing to make it a little bit more fair.15) Being put up against a full team of no lifers/try hards (1000 hours + game time) since they party queued up and you're no where close to their game time.16) AFK's that never get kicked/banned because they exploit it or they're ""botting"" to farm loot crates. But if you go afk to go do something quickly (bathroom drink etc) you'll find out you've already been autokicked in 10 secs or less. I only recommend it if you're playing with friends/family.

2016-12-11,0,0,241,False,Not Recommended,"Update Feb 4th 2018 Servers are basically broken now I guess. Local matches still work fine but the decline I noticed last year apparently continued as even with very low ping the online servers are an unresponsive unplayable wreck. The game crashes regularly now and PsyNet players have gone from a majority to a near absolute meaning online grouping is that much less social and able to offer strong teamwork (due to PsyNet players being unable to read or write in chat). Likewise all interesting levels have been stripped out in favor of a standardized design in short removing much of what made the game interesting in the first place. Several modes suffer a notable loss of appeal due to this reduction in play options Most notably Rocket Labs . Several new bugs.Update Jan 12th 2017 Server quality continues to degrade with servers occasionally crashing and existing bugs remaining unaddressed and made more frequent by worsening server conditions. Community grows more and more toxic with trolls in every other match. The devs still have not added a basic block system much less visibily enforced their community standards. I'll reiterate This game currently just isn't recommendable on its public gameplay.tl dr version Very good basic game but still lacking a lot of polish and features. Feels a bit EA still in that regard.Recommendable for private play where it plays out as fun as any multiplayer arena game but absolutely not recommendable for public play where frequent server issues an overwhelmingly toxic and exploitative community numerous unresolved bugs and design flaws and lousy matchmaking all make for a game that is more often than not very disagreeable to play. Great game offering a blend of childhood marbles like physics fun racing hijinks soccer gameplay and even arena brawling. It's a game that's inherently easy to pick up play and enjoy and really plays just the way you'd expect it to from the videos and screenshots no disappointments in that regard. So really if it looks at all interesting to you you should pick it up! ..wait or not. For a good while now there've been some significant issues in the game that the developers have failed to address in any way and it mars an otherwise solid game.* Horribly toxic community seemingly no oversight by the devs in that regard. You can mute the players for that single match but it doesn't carry over to any other match or prevent regrouping with them. It also doesn't address other abusive gameplay elements idling (for drops) is a key example being so common that you're bound to bump into it after just a couple of runs (and during the holiday events expect this to be nearly every run)There are a lot of amazingly capable and fun and positive players in this game and if the developers approached things with any degree of oversight this might actually be one of the better communities in an online game. Unfortunately as with any MMO where toxic individuals understand that there are no punishments for acting out what should be a minor occurance has wildfired.Doesn't help that the report function no longer allows you to report users once they leave a match so you'll sometimes get people deliberately sabotaging their team spewing a bunch of curses and then ragequitting. On the other hand when I've discussed reporting users to other players the positive minded players gave a clear impression of ""it's useless the devs won't do anything"" while the negative minded ones laughed and well said the same thing.So that's clearly the biggest issue of it all.* Input recognition failures flip recognition failures ability activation failures contact recognition glitches most of these issues can be explained by server issues that've persisted (and in many ways only grown worse) since the Rumble release some time back. But they're common and they're going to bite you in the at least a couple of times each match most matches. Some matches are completely unplayable because of these issues. * Joining in progress matches doesn't prevent you from rejoining a match you left (due to toxic players) and despite a recent patch still spawns you in at very disadvantageous circumstances often leading you to run right into the ball upon spawn sending it as often as not into your own goal. * Rumble mode is unpolished with several minor quirks. Most notably the inability to properly target with targeted abilities and their often switching targets as you activate them can cause you to inadverently help your opponents rather than hinder them. * General modes don't use any sort of ranking system to make sure you get decent matches or even matches to your skill level so it's always a complete crapshoot to lobby up. On the other hand ranked modes are based on the (in my opinion) very subpar 3v3 mode (if that was all the game had I wouldn't actually recommend it due to the size of most of the arenas and the sometimes glitchy physics it's too easy in standard 3v3 to get a lucky shot into a goal). Mind you this isn't really a flaw with 3v3 itself but with the maps used for 3v3 (which are typically better designed for 4v4). Hoops the basketball mode also suffers from being better suited for 3v3 play (and a slightly larger map) than for 2v2. Meanwhile on the opposite side of things Hockey (3v3) lacks the physics glitches of normal 3v3 due to its hockey puck shaped ball and works fabulously in 3v3. Rumble (the mode with activatable abilities) is crazy enough to get by in 3v3 as well and Chaos (4v4) is the ideal team play mode working far better with most maps than 3v3 does.So the option is to play standard ranked (which you can't easily leave without closing client the way which in a way is understandable but also makes bad public groupings all the more painful. Definitely do ranked with a team of players you're comfortable with rather than public grouping it.) or to play unranked matches with no meaningful matchmaking system at all but far better mechanics and balancing.At least from my perspective and preferences the game is lacking a lot of polish.The game is at a glance fantastic no doubt. And when you get good pairings and a functional server it's a calculated sports game with all the appeal of a racing game throwin in with fabulous teamwork potential. Other than the above issues and still lacking a bit of variety in modes and maps the game is thoroughly solid. So I'll gladly swap this to a positive review in an instant as soon as the devs at least give firm indication that they care about the general gameplay of the game as much as they do their premium leagues.That's not me being petty with my review but a simple fact to the rating system Steam uses While I can definitely say I occasionally enjoy this game when I'm playing with friends or manage a very lucky grouping I can't at all say I recommend it in its current state. There's just too much frustration in it and those moments of enjoyment are often a challenge to obtain.If you intend to avoid the public gameplay altogether and just play on teams fully crewed by friends you're likely to find this game enjoyable. Inherently I'd even put this among the topmost games in both sports and arena brawlers comparable to any of the best ones out there (except of course for the lack of polish in some areas and with it having less scale than most sports games and having less variety of content than most arena brawlers).If you're intending this for play with friends either in closed groups or in a ranked team then I can certainly recommend giving this game a go. If you're in for the public gameplay aspect then I really can't the toxic community and bad servers compounded with other minor stresses make this game one of the more problematic online games out there.",Rocket League®
2018-02-06,2,9,2145,False,Not Recommended,I bought Rocket League soon after release in 2015. I later bought DLCs and then keys and I now have nearly 2000 hours in game all on the same PC. I ve probably played it more than any other video game in my life and I ve been playing video games for a very long time (many years longer than most of the people here). Rocket League even reminds me a little bit of the great times I had playing Re Volt online nearly 20 years ago.In theory Rocket League is amazing. The concept is great the possibilities are endless and the matches should be a lot of fun. In reality though this game is completely broken. Playing it has become a frustrating chore. For those of you who are new or thinking about buying Rocket League here are some of the things you should expect in an average session Extremely angry and immature players. Your opponents and teammates will invent reasons to insult you or tell you to die. If you ignore them or don t give them the reaction they want they ll throw the game throw a temper tantrum or quit playing. (Maybe they re just ticked off because of the many bugs and glitches in the game but that s no excuse.) After getting complaints from players for months Psyonix finally added a way to report toxic people but it never works. Even after you report some random kid for using racial slurs or telling you to kill yourself even if you quit and search for a different match you ll likely get stuck with the same person for another 3 or 4 games in a row. This is the least of your worries though. Lag. The game will freeze for 30 seconds (often right at kickoff) your car will fly through the ball instead of hitting it cars will randomly teleport half way across the field or the ball will do a U turn in the air without touching anything. Sometimes the lag is more subtle than that but it is constant and game breaking. Basically the game is always out of synch so there s really no way to know if you re truly playing the same match that your teammates and opponents are playing.Point and scoring errors. This is a problem that became obvious with the Labs update but now happens in all game modes. Points for hits saves and etc. will get calculated for one team but not for the other. You might get zero points for multiple saves and shots on goal while the other team immediately racks up hundreds of points for small stuff like centers and clears.Artificial winning or losing streaks. No matter what the players rank/MMR is regardless of how well you play and regardless of how well the other team plays you may lose (or win) 10 or 20 matches in a row for no good reason. This problem has been getting much worse in the last year. I ve really started to wonder if Rocket League is a game of skill or a game of chance. Are the defective servers cutting corners by just choosing one side to win before the match even starts?The infamous heavy car bug. You ll play a few matches just fine and then all of a sudden the car begins to turn jump and accelerate much more slowly than normal like you re driving through water or like the gravity physics have changed. This used to happen to me very occasionally and then a couple of months ago it started happening in every single match I played. Eventually I got fed up and uninstalled the game.You don t have to take my word for any of this. All of these problems are well documented in hundreds of posts on official and unofficial Rocket League discussion forums. You might have to dig a bit to find them though. They usually get quickly downvoted buried or removed. (A few months ago the official subreddit even made searching more inconvenient by hiding the search box on the front page. Now you have to click the rules or wiki link to find it.)When I started playing Rocket League it usually worked well. These bugs and glitches have gotten worse and worse over the last 2 and a half years. About a year ago Psyonix started making public statements promising that they re finally going to work on the servers to fix all the synch and lag issues. We re still waiting for that to happen. If the company ever decides to actually do something I would love to reinstall and keep playing maybe even to 3000 hours or more. But for now I m not going to waste any more time stupidly wishing that these problems get fixed. I hate to say it but at this rate I m worried that the game won t last much longer anyway.It was fun while it lasted. Caveat emptor.,Rocket League®

Bloody fun game and rather easy to learnEDIT!While game is fun i cannot reccommend this game to anyone. Community is toxic and is deteriorating whereas developers are just now starting to deal with this and methods are lacking. Only way to play this game is chat off except quick messages. Otherwise you likely get flooded with messages that make known salty games look like heaven.It also still has several serious issues that still havent been adressed whereas psyonix has no problem pumping out DLC s &amp eye candy to distract from issues. For example hit registration while generally good has hiccups rather often lately. with stable ping. theres little more rage inducing than ball just going through you without even reacting and having replays to confirm it. Not only one who has it as wellBut thats honhestly rather new problem. Good example of old problem is matchmaking in ranked. I get its hard to make good matchmaking but at least pair up people in same SKILL GROUP. Its not funny anymore if i get low gold/silver players in my team vs plats every single time i get close to diamond. Its one of problems i've been raising ruckus all over the place for ages now only thing i've gotten for it is fanboys guarding psyonix despite the evidence i provided. They have tried to cover that up distract from it by changing ranked system rank names &amp systems....Apparently they havent had time or resources to fix any of issues but they sure have time and resources to make lootboxes! eye candy!

2017-05-07,0,0,2,False,Not Recommended,Product received for free. Well i played the free weekend to see what the fuss was about.I had played LucioBall in Overwatch which was quite fun and had already liked the concept from when I first saw the metroid 3DS spinoff minigame.So now I got to play the king of the genre (I played mostly 3vs3 for my time).... well I have to say i'm disapointed. Having cars is nice and fun but it induces a real lack of accuracy both in the turning and momentum management. Sure i obviously do not control this game as a seasoned player learned of the double jump and spin to hit the ball better only after a few games but I was hard pressed to find anyone in my games that seemed to control this game as a sports should control. It basically felt like polo.... handling a horse and hitting each other more than the ball. Second beef is on the ball itself the physics seem to be lacking. It hugs to the walls and doesn't bump much unless you really boost before.... feels weak.In short I may have been spoiled with LucioBall where the controls were somehow just spot on (it had its flaws too notably the ultimate and bumping the keeper....) but this game really feels that it falls short of what it could be in many ways. Now there are a lot of people playing so I guess it's better a to play a decent multiplayer game with people than a great one with no one. But unless you really have time to spend i wouldn't recommend this game.,Rocket League®

I'll update this review if its fixed in a reasonable amount of time.,Rocket League®
2016-07-03,0,0,373,False,Not Recommended,Okay let us be honest. The game mechanically? Pretty much flawless. While it has a seemingly infinite skill curve you are quite able to jump in and just enjoy the game. There is no problem there.Where my issue enlies the community. It has what I would describe as your typical eSports community . . . which means it is full of s and people that make you wish you were playing with them in person so you could bash them over the head with your keyboard. You will be accused of AFK botting while having over half the team's kills people complaining that you didn't block a single shot when they've never defended all game all sorts of bullcrap. Since the single player has little to offer having to deal with the hassles of other people is the only limitation to enjoying the game. So basically here's the question If you would be willing to recommend a game like League of Legends or DotA2 to people you know based on the community would you? The answer to that is no I couldn't and the same applies here. I may play it every so often because it is mechanically beautiful but the community reminds me why I don't stay around long.,Rocket League®
2017-05-27,1,20,594,False,Not Recommended,HONEST REVIEW NO TPros Fun casually and competitively to play with friends New experience Frequent updatesCons Toxic community Need to play with friends or will get with toxics teammates Terrible matchmaking system Extreme learning curve Bugs are a regular occurance (such as ball stuck in free play) Unfair placement matchesI currently do not recommend this game for new commers. I've played 300 hours of this game and have had a decent experience but this game needs a lot more development to become better and actually playable at a competitive and casual level. People expect a nice community with welcome arms to a new game they recently purchased but its quite the opposite filled with toxic rage quitters in all casual modes except rumble and flamming players who are terrible at the game in competitive. The ranking system is a joke and is WORSE than the CS GO matchmaking system. There a TON of smurfs that love to ruin the game's fun and the learning curve is extreme with the tutorial being practically useless with only few guides to teach proper mechanics and basics of the game. The competitive experience is awful with a party basically manditory if you want to win or not at a high level (PLATINUM 3+). People are placed at ranks they don't deserve and feels as if they are practically throwing the game. There is no AI system in competitive and in 3's (standard) there is no kicking system to kick trollers or smurfs. Thankfully there are no cheats in the game and once you get to a decent rank people know somewhat how to play the game. To conclude I think Rocket League has great potential with a growing E sports scene but I think the reviews are too biased and to not give a good in sight to the actual game and just say it's fun when it is but there are too many cons that outweight the pros. The game needs a lot of develpoment and the ranking system needs an overhaul. Season 4 needs to be forgotten about and move straight on to Season 5 where I expect nothing but good things to come since the dev team seems very dedicated to improving Rocket League as a whole.,Rocket League®

Makes no since and would have to mean i go down on wins.. fix game. Then it might be worth a re review.Edit Seemes to have improved to get better matchmaking (more even experince) but you alaways go down a rank if not 2 when losing but half the tiime you do no rank up for a win?

2017-02-24,0,0,789,False,Not Recommended,Hello friends. I played this game 700 hrs so you can say I have seen nearly everything in this game. I have to say it's a good game to play and compete with other players around the world. But if you get to the point where you have to improve your gameplay massively to win even normal games....So in my case I have to play against low challenger tier players or champion players it's never really balanced (I'm currently Rising Star in all four categories in ranked). It really is a funny game to play with friends or without if you're in the low level tiers not ranked but your player level in particular. But when you get higher and higher the balancing of the matchmaking gets worse and worse....The second big point is the community. You sometimes have games where everyone is on the same level of skill super friendly and they stay for at least 3 games. But often you get leavers in normals almost every game people who insult others spam commands if you failed and so on. And it feels like reporting them has no impact at all. For myself I decided to lay down my controller after 700 hrs. Sad to say but I can't enjoy it anymore. Was a fun time well at least half of it was.,Rocket League®

2017-07-16,0,0,218,False,Not Recommended,Rocket League is like Surgeon Simulator but with cars and rockets. By that I mean of course that the controlls are comically inaccurate.Rocket League is fine for casual play but don't play it competitvely.With a controller it's almost impossible to line your shots up. The game is really 50% luck. It's very hard to get good at the game because you don't focus on strategy more than you do trying to line your shots up. Most of the 'skill' comes from being able to use the controller effectively and it's super hard because it's so sensitive. It's very frustrating and after as much as I've played the game I just can't recommend it. In fact I have permanantly removed the game from my library because the game is just that bad. If you can play the game and have fun with it great but just don't expect to try and play it competitvely because you'll be spending more time trying to learn the controlls than strategizing your gameplay. It's very similar to billiards in that sense. You know where you want the ball to go it's actually hitting it the right way which is the hardest part.,Rocket League®

When you have done these everything starts over again.So basicly about 10% of the time the game is actually great.Unfortunately if you play in your rank (not smurfing) you have a 50% of getting a toxic tm8.If you find a normal player you'll be ok even if you lose but in those other scenarios your tm8 will flame you after the first mistake even if it happens after 3 minutes of gameplay and you're guaranteed to lose that match no matter what happens.,Rocket League®

2017-06-04,0,0,892,False,Not Recommended,"At its core Rocket League is a unique game with an addicting twist. That gives them enough of an advantage to be able to gain players despite a horrible development company that does a lot of shady crap. First let's start with some major design flaws 1. The Matchmaking is the worst I've ever seen in a game. No one is at their proper rank and it matches you very unevenly. Most games are boring snoozefest blowouts one way or another.2. Account buyers are ing rampant. This makes the horrendous matchmaking even worse.3. The servers have been bad for years and constantly go down. Psyonix apparently has no idea how to fix them.4. There are some bugs which they just outright have stated they don't know how to fix. There was an 'invisible goalpost' bug that they had to work around and now goalpost redirects seem to go in random directions. You'll clip through the ball constantly and desync is a horrible issue.The Development Team Psyonix is up there with DayBreak for ""Worst Development Company in History"". For example they control the subreddit and their EMPLOYEE moderators are toxic as hell. However they have made efforts to fix this by removing such toxic mods as HoraryHellfire so that deserves some recognition.In addition though Psyonix holds the RLCS every year where they offer peanuts to the winning team and shove advertisements/promos everywhere. Their esports scene is so forced its nauseating. All casters are required to smile at all times and they have to wear suits and can't cuss. There's product placement for Brisk everywhere to the point where the chat just spams 'Brisk' as a joke. On top of that Psyonix viewbots extremely badly. This year's RLCS was at 120k viewers and jumped to 190k within a 15 second timeframe. They aren't even good at viewbotting.On a final note as toxic as Psyonix's employees are the community is much worse. Expect leavers in around half of your games. I can't remember the last time I played an evenly matched 3v3. It's honestly been at least a year (over 2 000 matches).Obviously I have a of hours in RocketLeague because Im addicted to the core concept. Everyone keeps saying ""this is the season they fix matchmaking this is the season they hire on better developers etc"". It never happens. It's never going to happen. Do yourself a favor and stay away from this game.TL DR The core of the game is massively addicting. The matchmakings awful and the development company is beyond belief.

2016-01-02,2,12,42,False,Recommended,This is definitely the most fun game I've played in a long time. Who thought cars and soccer would fit so well together? I haven't laughed out loud at my own failures before but seeing myself in the replay acting like a total dingus has brought on a few laughs. There has been too many times where I'm really close to hitting the ball in the goal and I jump in real life instinctively to try and ease the ball in there.I have yet to play ranked as I feel casual is plenty of fun and I personally enjoy casual over ranked in games I don't take very seriously. In casual however people tend to quit when the game turns against their favor which I feel ruins it a bit. There really is no punishment to this other than loss of XP gained. This does not ruin the fun for me though.All in all this game is tons of fun if you just sit back and play casually.,Rocket League®

2016-05-30,3,28,248,False,Not Recommended,"I really want to recommend this game but I can't. I've been playing almost since day one and if I was writing this review back then i would be recommending it. The game is incredibly fun but quality has been steadily declining since it was released. When the game was first released you could get into a match instantly and ping was great. I consistently had less than 10ms ping. Now it takes a few minutes to get into a match (even though there are more people playing) and ping has been steadily increasing with every update they do to the game. I'm lucky if I can get into a server with a ping least than 40ms. Even though 40 ping isn't bad it is way to high for a game that is highly dependent on reaction time and precise maneuvers. I also never had any issues running this game. It always ran flawlessly. It wasn't until recently that my game started crashing randomly and having two crashes in the matter of 15 minutes is what motivated me to write this review.On another note the physics are flawed. When I first started playing Rocket League the physics felt great and seems super realistic (minus pinching the ball) but as I played the game more and more I started to notice that the physics don't react proper in a lot of situations. I don't know for sure what is wrong but it seems like there is no friction at all and the ball's momentum reacts very strange at times. Collisions between vehicle make no sense to me. It seems completely random what happens when you hit someone else or when someone hits you. I have tapped someone and sent them flying to the moon and I have slammed someone at full speed and been stopped dead in my tracks. And whenever you get hit your car just arbitrarily spins killing any momentum you had when you were hit. I feel like Psyonix doesn't care about the quality of the game anymore and they are just pushing more and more new content. Don't get me wrong I love everything they have added and basketball is (in my opinion) way better than soccer but it feels like they are neglecting the quality that the game once had. They keep releasing all these car packs but it doesn't feel like they are fixing any of the problems with the game like the matchmaking.I love this game but it is slowly falling out of my favorites. Ultimately I can't recommend it but I will be more than happy to change my review if Psyonix brings the game back to what it use to be. There are a couple more things I want to note about this game but they did not influence my recommendation for this game since they are related to the community and not Psyonix directly. This will probably sound like a rant more than anything but these things need to be said.The community for this game is awful to put it bluntly. I occasionally get good matches with people who are fun and respectful and we have a blast but then there are matches where your entire team leaves if you get scored on in the first 5 seconds or people are being disrespectful to each other. In ranked matches I've had people totally blow up on me for making a mistake. I understand playing competitively and wanting to win. Nobody likes losing but people need to remember it's just a game and losing is part of any game. Something needs to be done about the people who leave mid game. Banning people doesn't fix anything. Implementing a system that separates quitters and non quitters might be beneficial. This system would track everyone and how often they leave matches before they are over. When you search for matches it will try to put you into a game with a similar quitting levels so that quitters play together and non quitters play together. Obviously this is very black and white and an actual implementation wouldn't be this crude but I think a system like this could be a step in the right direction.Rocket League is a difficult game. I have put many hours into it and I'm still pretty mediocre at it. The only way to get better is to play the game more. When you quit you are losing valuable game time that could help improve your own skills. I take more from matches where I lost than matches where I won. When you are beat it gives you a chance to analyze what you did wrong and makes you better. This goes along with the old saying ""Quitters never win and winners never quit.""",Rocket League®

2016-10-24,0,0,20,False,Not Recommended,I really really love this game. The reason I can't give it a positive review is not for the game design but for the frequently horrible community. I found countless times that during competitive play if my team was down a goal the other members of my team would drop out. Thus leaving me to be 1v3 or 1v2 with slim to nil chance of winning. Furthermore the penalties for abandoning a match early are not serve enough. 15 minute bans should be raised to 24 hour or 48 hour bans for dropping out of the game.Coupled with the terrible team mates work ethic the match making system is horrible. I would often find myself with players of pings well over 200 when I am searching for servers only within my region. The option of cross play with PlayStation players seems like a great idea but they would often have terrible pings and were almost always the first to throw a match.I really want to give this game a thumbs up but given that the core claws of this game are centred on competitive multiplayer (which is flawed at its very core) prevent me from doing so. 5/10.,Rocket League®

I hate the COMMUNITY for this game and consequentially the game became a constant headache.I played over 300 hours of this game and before I quit I was at expert level 43 I believe. I do not suck at the game so don't go thinking that is why I am hating. I am not hating I am being honest. I LOVE THIS GAME the care and thought (mostly well intended) by the developers is visible. The micro transactions only recently added are excusable considering the amount of cars and content you can get normally. BUT... we must get to the biggest problem of this game THE GARBAGE COMMUNITY.The MLG 420 casual idiotic pathetic and tryhard nature of the culture that the Rocket League community has taken since the game's release is what drags the game down to rock bottom. Competitive ironically is actually the most enjoyable part of the game most of times as there are ""stakes"" to the match and people play more tactical and grounded. Meaning actual strategy coordination and some fun. It has its problems but more often than not it is fine. What SUCKS is the regular modes which are supposed to be the most fun ones. Standard is where most players are but if you see a GRAN CHAMPION ROCKETEER and similar LEAVE IMMEDIATELY your fun will be ruined especially if they are in a party (which is almost always). The level of no life these pathetic wastes of oxygen demonstrate is almost unthinkable and the game rewards it what was once cool and interesting to see in ariels and cool passes has devolved into unblockable lopsided matches and outright of players who HAVE LIVES and choose not to spend 1000s of hours playing this garbage. At least in normal modes you can leave without being penalized from matchmaking. And speaking of this ing matchmaking...THE MATCHMAKING IS You will be put in matches you just left placed against way out of your league players and occasionally parties will get split. It sucks which is confusing when this could have been mostly fixed by adding the skill variable from competitive to this but keeping it hidden since it is normal mode. Also why is there no added clause to the matchmaking preventing you from joining the match you just left? It is infuriating...FINAL VERDICT 2/10This game was fin when it launched everyone was learning together learning the tactics and cooperation in order to win matches. But implementing and fostering E SPORTS GARBAGE hyping up competitive play and trying to keep ING OUR WALLETS with t DLC to such a degree it is no longer excusable but just shameful Rocket League becomes even more casual and frustrating than Call of Duty.

It's fun addicting fast paced and a blast to play with your friends. There's great customization through a leveling system and even great content as the devs are adding FREE new modes like a basketball mode and hockey mode with more coming soon. There's even a Rocket Labs playlist where you can play experimental maps that the colorful minds of the devs make. There's also great paid DLC like the Batmobile and the Back to the Future Deloreon to use in games. Hell even the graphics are great and the unique futuristic artstyle is beautiful. The game is easy to pick up but hard to master. I was rusty for about 2 hours but once you get the hang of the controls it's fun. Rocketing in a goal never has felt so good.This is a must own for any gamer. It's a masterpiece and needs to be played by you. Should you buy? YES!

Teamwork is what makes this game great. And now you're wondering ""wait is this a bad review?"" Yes because unless you have friends that can play at the same level as you you're screwed. Solo queueing in competetive/ranked mode is the most masochist thing to do. Hence why I even got the urge to change my name to ""Trash Teammate Magnet"". But why do I claim my teammates are trash if I'm matched with players who are about the same rank as me? Because simply ranks don't matter anymore diamond rank is the new silver. I don't have a temper nor am I easily annoyed but when the same bullcrap happens again and again again and again especially when you get matched with the same bad teammates from the game before 3x in a row (my record is 5x in a row great matchmaking btw) yeah it's natural to get angry.

2017-03-29,0,0,619,False,Recommended,A stunning game whic exceptional physics and incredible mechanics perfect for teaming up or going head to head with friends online or on split screen!When you first start the game you only think of things on a single plane only ever staying on the floor. Very quickly you learn that the ability to jump high to block shots or even fly (aerial) works to your advantage more so than you ever thought. The combos that some people can pull off after practicing hard for hours on end really pays off and makes your shots look 300% cooler and way more impressive to show off.The physics are spectacular really nice to see some real effort put in into the immersion to this 'fantasy' game.However only criticisms i can make is (a) the crappy flaming scamming community that is its really off putting and just taints any enjoyment you initially had(b) server issues hiccups on clientside every so often despite low ping (20 30) you will get random hiccups in game which could potentially ruin a game/shot. Incredibly annoying when youve set up the perfect shot to only end up looking like a complete idiot to everyone else on the server who will just see you mess up and not see that the game jumped on your side.To clarify i have a TITAN X (Maxwell) and i7 7700K and 32GB DDR4 so there are 0 issues with game performance (i play in 4k60 but the framrates go up to 110 when vsync is disabled) so its not my PC which are causing these stutters.,Rocket League®

2016-12-12,1,2,472,False,Not Recommended,After playing this game for over 400 hours I came to the conclusion that I can not recommend this game. The game itself is pretty awesome but many of the players you'll meet in public games just aren't. The game changed quite a bit over time due to patching and the addition of new stuff but not all for the better. Once you reach the level of expert/master things change. Matchmaking becomes quite a joke and not everyone is interested in playing all available maps. With the latest patch you're somewhat forced to play maps you don't want to play in unranked matches. How to counter this? Exactly play ranked. Ranked matches are flawed these days. If you do not have a proper team to play with and communicate with chances of losing are high. Lots and lots of trolls in this game idlers smurfs people leaving ranked matches and so on. Not to mention the salty people you'll encounter. On the higher levels it comes down to skills and teamplay. Skills you can practice for but for teamplay you need proper teammates not usually the ones you'll find in public games who all chase the ball into the same corner all the time. With non ranked games you'll encounter a lot of players leaving and joining all the time. People give up way too easily and some stay in a game for way too long. Surely everyone is allowed to do what they want but don't ruin the match for others.For me this game is only fun when playing with a proper team. Public games are more of a struggle rather than anything else these days. For new players the game will be fun nonetheless learning all the techniques being amazed at how you actually managed to score a really weird goal from a weird angle bumping into other players all the time and failing bigtime at flying. I'm not an expert at this game myself and I make mistakes every now and then as well but some people at master/legend level still have skills of a semi pro.Combine everything together and you'll have an excellent and balanced game with a few annoying possibilities due to Psyonix dictating what maps you sometimes have to play in non ranked but the public players are what ruin the experience and fun on higher levels.,Rocket League®

It's a boring sport full of panzies who cry any time another player enters their personal space. It is corrupt but worse yet it's run by old men *gasp!*. I like cars but even the best car games get dull for me reasonably fast.So when I head about this game you can imagine how thrilled I was (""wow that looks like a piece of quot ) but I did have some reservations. How much would this game revolve around a love of Sports Ball? *I don't love Sports Ball.* Would how well I play be determined by what crap I have unlocked? Would there be anything about the gameplay that kept me interested beyond the initial 30 minutes of learning the game and playing the tutorials and a few rounds? Honestly that was my biggest worry would I get bored of this inside of an hour? Well I played for several hours immediately after installing it and the next night I played for another hour or two. At the moment I feel like I'm going to continue playing the game probably every day. So I'm definitely not getting bored of it fast. The gameplay is incredibly well balanced. As far as I can tell the only thing determining how well you play is well you. Learn to master the techniques required to execute awesome shots and you will do well. However no man is an army just as no man is a team. This game is totally fine to just drop in and play a round here and there with strangers but it REALLY excels when you are on voice chat with a group of friends and actually can have a bit of strategy. Maybe that night one specific person is doing great in goal so they want to play net. Maybe they seem to be getting all the easy goals so they are charging in and striking. I don't feel that any of the elements of this game limit a person to always playing one position either. The first night I played I was absolutely awful at playing defense on the net. The second night that seemed to be the only thing I was good at. But nobody is locked into a position which I really love. The point is it's flexible. If you play goal you're not stuck there you can play the field and take shots on net and still rip back and try to make saves.Another thing I like about the game the number of players can DRASTICALLY change how you play the game (tactics and such) but also how difficult and balanced it seems. In a 4v4 game it's absolute chaos when there is a scramble for the ball and it makes for some really hilarious moments and ridiculous goals.What does this game remind me of? Combine the vehicles and silly driving of Sega classic Rock 'N' Roll Racing with the balanced gameplay and hats of TF2 throw in a dash of Sports Ball with the absolute anarchy of I don't know a bunch of 7 year olds on PCP playing soccer and you've got Rocket League.

Low Level gameplay is 99% stomp or get stomped as you get smurfs or real noobs in the first 10 ranks (each with 5 divisions).Therefore this game is no fun and I will not continue to play it anymore I suggest to not buy it unless you are willing to put your life into one game or get stomped.,Rocket League®

2016-07-14,0,0,279,False,Not Recommended,"Rocket League is all of what you can see rocket powered RC cars playing soccer and recently hockey and basketball.When teams are balanced and everyone knows how to play it's amazing challenging and loads of fun. Sadly this is a rare event. Most of the time you'll either be assigned the world's derpiest team or the opposition will be comprised of super saiyans and jedis. If you're particularly unlucky (about 15% of the time for me) you'll end up with both.Speed boosts are awesome and essential for high rank gameplay particularly when 70% of players above Pro Rank fly around like birds and I'm flopping like a dying fish. When I use it boost seems rather underwhelming at 24 or less and getting more can be painful due to the nodes littered around the arena not respawning fast enough for the gratuitous use they get.Getting to a higher rank is rather tedious when you get to semi pro and worse when trying for veteran. Experience requirements seem rather high for no reward other than getting a higher rank.But what truly ruins the fun of the game is the completely broken match making system. Team balancing in Rocket League is simply ""put players in here till 3 each team"". The game will FREQUENTLY put much higher ranked players into the match obliterating the hopes of the opposition and spoiling the fun for their team. Update Originally written 14th July 2016. All the above still very true now 20th Jan 2017. All they seem to have done in the mean time is make more maps and cars and adopt a slimy Loot Box mechanic to filtch money from people.Matchmaking still completely screwed and people make it worse when abusing the team mechanic to bring in a much higher tier. Update Currently 3rd September 2018. Sadly matchmaking is going a loooong way backwards. Now far from making balanced matches there's shoddy programming that results in queued teams (2 4 players that join the queue together) being put on separate teams in the match. By way of bugs there's also the 4v3 bug when matching puts an extra player on a full team. Everybody loves that one. /endsarcasmIf neither of these occur then you're subject to the usual nonsense of playing with others either above or below your rank (there's a strange lack of expert ranked people) and matching likes to take 10 15mins to place you even when there's over 13k people in the queue with you.In terms of progress there seems to be only as much content as they can sell you. Which thankfully is purely cosmetics at this point. They've been working on a lot of customisable parts some more thought out than others none of which really matter when there are such big issues with the core gameplay. If the matchmaking doesn't screw you (and it will) then the intermittent server issues will. (I play on the Oceanics so it might be just those.)I started this review over two years ago in hopes that maybe Psyonix would read it and realise they're missing the big problems of their game. That was two years ago. I now understand that they don't care beyond how much money they can squeeze out of people for cosmetics now that the spotlight of new release games has well and truly moved on.When the matchmaking was fixed I fully intended to come back to this review and rewrite it to give an accurate possibly even favourable summary of the game. Now two years on I realise that the window of opportunity has closed and so with it my hopes for the game.What you see here is a game with all the promise in the world and at times you can feel it fulfilled but for the most part it's a long wait between disappointing matchups. TL DR The developers don't care to fix issues that have been burdening the game for over two years and seem to put all their time into more cosmetics for Loot Boxes.If you're looking for a fun and balanced multiplayer game look elsewhere. If you want to play against players with loads more experience than you on a team with no goalie for little reward then welcome home.",Rocket League®

2018-04-28,1,2,4,False,Not Recommended,I went into this game with a clean slate just to see what it was like and if it was fun and sad to say but it really was not fun as a fair few issues kept cropping up with the game.Match Making SystemThe matchmaking system is a giant mess there seems to be no restrictions on whom you can meet and in my first few games I was getting put up against veterans with 500 1 000 hrs on their account and there is no fun to be had when you're just starting out and it throws you into games like this.The few times it did put me in a fair game with players around my level it was actually quite fun problem is these match were so minuscule that they were every 1/10 15 matches.Also the playercount must be really small or something as I ran into a lot of the same groups over and over just to hear more toxic abuse thrown my way about something that I did that they did not like.ToxicityPeople bailing on the game after the 1st goal or just helping the enemy team win the match though stopping you and your teammates or denying goals.The community toxicity is insane you make one slightly wrong move and you get called out for it and get a spam of noob and attempt to screw over the game for others like for example this is what has happened to me across the games I played.... deny goals bailing general toxicity in chat giving up so quick they might as well queued and then left the game as soon as it started driving around in circle for the whole match and I even ran into a teammate who job was to screw over our team to obviously help his buddies on the other team to get them leveled faster.The ServersWhat servers?the servers seem pretty unstable causing a lot of random teleports for most of my games as in one moment you could be chasing the ball and then it woudl vanish an re appear behind you which was very fustrating as I lost a lot of goals to this issue and toxicity I got for having a laggy game was at most point just unreasonable.The Loot SystemNow to begin with it seemed pretty good earn items over the coarse of the games you play no matter weather you win or lose but that then changed as I was wondering why I couln't find anything other than commons and the odd uncommon and all the great looking items were all etheir stick behind a dlc wall or a loot box that you need to spend money on keys opening and it really sucked a big amont of the joy I was having as I could not unlock any of these items with flashing my wallet.ConculsionIt's such a shame to see a great game fall so far as it seemed fun for a little while until it was all replaced with toxicity lagging and really poor matchmaking which really killed the enjoyment of the game for me and the sad thing was it got to the point where ethier I would have to play with frenids or against the bots to actually experince any enjoyment in this game.To sum upOnly buy if your going to play with frenids or if you just like making yourself suffer by playing against people who are just toxicity and act like a bunch of spoiled children who will throw a temper tamturn if you don't score the first point and then proceed to leave or throw the gameA great game that could of been even greater but instead it has fallen flat on it's face and been stomped to death.,Rocket League®

2018-02-14,0,0,364,False,Not Recommended,I am quite sad to downvote this. Don't get me wrong its an amazing game. The easy to learn hard to master trait is a given for this. The amount of techniques and skills you can learn just from the time playing all the way to the customized training modules in the menu in which have taught me so much and the amount of fresh training activities that are updated daily never cease to help me further improve. The game is the best when you're playing with mates 2 3 or even 4. Its crazy how much fun and hype you can get from scoring an insane fluke goal and ride of a wave of victories with your friends till all hours of the night. Now...This is why I am downvoting this Firstly the community on its own is the most toxic i've seen since league of legends and its not even scraping the surface of whats wrong. The amount of trolling and throwing your partner can do if you're playing competitive is just baffling and they always and will always probably get away with it unless the punishment system is further improved. Nothing seems to work to combat people whom throw if you make a mistake etc. If you're thinking of getting into this game for the competitive standpoint whilst playing solo you're in for a ride of frustration. The matchmaking is all kinds of terrible for example Yourself (Platinum) playing doubles by yourself will get yourself matched with a player (Gold) in which severly handicaps your team in the amount of skill you have to verse your opposing teams whom are 8 times out of 10 queued together. And as I've said the toxicity you will encounter I can't even fathom. The lag the amount of rubber banding I have encountered and not only myself but people whom I play with also experience the same issue. Been here since day 1 and its been until now.. I don't think its getting fixed anytime soon. Thats all I can really think of as of now.+1 playing with mates 1 playing soloBut I cannot say that this is a bad game its well done and if you have friends to play it with its defintely worth your time.

Now I live in shanghai and I can play almost every game because of the decent internet here but before I purchased this game I had no idea online play was impossible in China. Rocket league uses google features and the all mighty great fire wall of China blocked Google a while back. I was able to connect to the servers using vpn but the connection simply wasn't steady. I was able to play a few online games with the lag and the games were still very exhilarating but I can still not hide my feeling of disappointment.

2018-12-07,0,0,161,False,Not Recommended,The people who designed this game thought lets make a game where cars can hit a ball like soccer. Then another guy was like oh yeah lemme do some realistic physics for it. Then they were like naw that doesnt sound like fun lets make a glitchy mess where the ball flies foreward when backward momentum is applied to it and if two cars hit it at close to the same time it multiplies their vectors because why not? If you do manage to hit the ball where you want you have to deal with see through walls that bounce the ball off in ways you wont be able to predict until you have invested you sad life into this game. The ramp on the side which most likely was ac cop out from designers bounces the ball in a different way every time so there is no memorizing this and should be avoided if you hope to do anything productive in game. Along with this COMPLETE TRASH PHYSICS they also decided to make a ranking system that ensentavises smurfs. Now you can derank you solo rank down to bronze without effecting you coveted 3v3. You get to be a pathetic loser and trash on legit player trying to learn to play! Doesn't that sound like a great time? Why try to make it fun for new players when you have to keep the old ones happy. Sad design team and terrible ranking system. I could pay a indian scammer for 2 hours to make a system that is more comprehensive and makes more sense than this trash. Just today what tipped me over the edge was that i had worked my way up to Bronze 3 Division 4 (a game away from silver) and instead of playing another brinze player trying to rank up i played a silver 2. I lost then played again silver 3. Then again it was a silver 1. This TRASH system matched me against silvers until i deranked all the way down to Division 1. On top of that everyone i played was hitting insane arials some of which i'd never seen. It discusts me that i cant even rank up from the bottom tier without having people with hundreds to thousands of hours more than me trashing on me. It's pathetic and sad and the disigners of the game know about it and do nothing. It pisses me off how sad the player who can't win in their own rank are but this company loves them because they keep swiping their mom's credit card to buy cases. Congrats on taking a good concept and completely trashing it with terrible mechanics and the most pathetic player base in any game i've played before. I won't be wasting money on any other games from this publisher because it is clear they care more about micro transactions and retention of trash human beings rather than a good game and getting new people into it. If you are thinking about trying this game DON'T because everyone is better than you and you will lose every game until you give up anywasys so just save the time and money and don't buy this pathetic excuse of a game.,Rocket League®

2016-09-10,0,0,9,False,Recommended,Simply this game is great and I reccomend it to everyone. The game is pretty simple. It's soccer with cars. But it's much more than that. There are many skills that you can master in the game such as striking aerials and playing goalie. There is also a CS GO like ranking system for different game modes of Rocket League such as solo standard doubles and singles. They each have their perks of playing them. In singles you just depend on yourself and no teammates but in solo standard you depend a lot on your teammates whether that be a good thing or a bad thing. Although it's not just about the soccer. There are cosmetics that you can collect such as car skins and wheels and Psyonix just released crates which you can open with keys that you buy from the store. A portion of the cost of the key is supposed to go to future Rocket League events. All in all the game is great.,Rocket League®

2017-11-26,0,0,0,False,Not Recommended,"Indoor soccer with walls on all sides (i.e. no out of bounds) is my favorite sport and this game seems to be popular in part because it captures part of what makes indoor soccer so exciting a team sport that has fast paced action (because of the small field size) and no stoppages (because you've got walls on all sides).Unfortunately if you've actually played indoor soccer you may find this game frustrating because of the relative lack of control that you have in this game.One aspect of the relative lack of control is in the movement controls. My impression is that you accelerate more slowly in this game than you do when you play indoor soccer and in indoor soccer you can immediately take off in any direction whereas in this game you're limited to going forwards and backwards and changing your direction gradually by steering. The controls make it feel more like ice/roller hockey than indoor soccer and while ice/roller hockey are fun I don't think the movement style in those sports are what make them great IMO the movement style in ice/roller hockey is just a side effect of ice hockey's need for a smooth slippery surface (ice) to have the small puck able to move smoothly / easily / predictably.Another aspect of the relative lack of control is in the passing. I did a Google search and it seems that passing is possible in this game but arguably much more difficult than in indoor soccer / hockey.Another aspect of the lack of control is maintaining control of the ball when you have possession. It seems that in this game you never really have possession you just strike the ball in a chosen direction once it's more like volleyball that way. In soccer and hockey there's a whole ""mini game"" of having one or more opponents trying to take the ball / puck from you and you using your skill to maintain control of the ball / puck.",Rocket League®

2018-08-14,0,0,695,False,Not Recommended,so after almost 3 years of playing this game on many platforms and many hours. im here to finally write the review. i used to adore this game and i used to playit every single day for many hours. now i cant stand to even look at it anymore. the ranking system has gone to horrible. the servers are worse then ever before. and the game doesnt care about you at all. every time ive been 1 win away from c2 ive played against all gcs or high c3s and ill have 2 dia 3s on my team. how in the world is this fair? how can 1 player carry 2 others in that high level of gameplay. and i know there will be people there saying just get better. but how can i be motivated to improve when it takes me 6 wins straight to div up but 1 loss to div down. seriously its dumb. ive even sent this to psynoix and they told me to just get better. but how am i supposed to? 1v3 all the time is not fun at all. play this game for unrank and with friends. do not i mean it seriously. do not play ranked. if you play ranked you will meet the side of this game you never want to see.,Rocket League®

2018-11-18,6,8,183,False,Not Recommended,Do I like this game?Yes.Do I recommend this game?No.Is it worth the money?It should be free because everything else ingame is not.SummaryIt's fun at first especially when you get better. But then you get to meet the toxic community and things go downhill. If you only wanna play this game on the couch with some friends it's perfect but unless you play with friends you're gonna have a bad time. Little kids are constantly complaining because they can't accept how bad they are. I like a game where I can chat with normal well functioning civil human beings. Maybe I'll play it again some day with the chat hidden.UpdateI have since my last comment been playing with every type of communication turned off. My game experience has improved in a way that I can play the game and don't get agitated. Unfortunately I'm missing the positive interaction with other players like saying Nice Shot or being able to tell my teammate what I'm going to do.ConclusionI'll probably just stick with casually playing with some friends on the couch or ocasionally having a quick match with all forms of communication turned off.,Rocket League®
2016-10-17,0,0,1206,False,Not Recommended,Amazingly fun game. Skill ceiling is somewhere up in the clouds. Highly addicitve gameplay keeps me around day after day but this game suffers from a horribly toxic community. If you are just a casual player that sticks to unranked matched or you play mostly with friends I don't think there are many games I could recommend more highly than this. But if you find yourself getting better and better and you switch over to ranked play prepare to encounter salty aggressive and downright mean players on a regular basis especially as you progress higher and higher up the ladder.Maybe it's the nature of competitive gameplay but as a person who has played a considerable number of hours in other competitive games in the past this one is up high on the list of toxic communities. The playerbase of Rocket League far more than the gameplay itself frequently leaves me feeling upset and irritated after just a few matches. Every minor mistake is immediately met with punishing insults and taunting by your own teammates. Even though I will continue to play this game it is because of the community that I encounter day after day that I have to say I ultimately do not recommend this game.TLDR Great fun for casual play or matches with friends. But if you are looking for a competitive game to enjoy this one has a horribly toxic community that will leave you feeling frustrated and angry more than anything else.,Rocket League®

I told him how cool it was to meet him in person but I didn t want to be a and bother him and ask him for photos or anything. He said Oh like you re doing now? I was taken aback and all I could say was Huh? but he kept cutting me off and going huh? huh? huh? and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in his hands without paying. The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional and was like Sir you need to pay for those first. At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter. When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually to prevent any electrical infetterence and then turned around and winked at me.

2017-02-21,2,1,1200,False,Not Recommended,Before you drop your hard earned $20 on this game I will warn you ROCKET LEAGUE IS RIGGEDWhat do I mean by this? Well a normal competitive sports game would allow each player on each team an equal chance of scoring and thus winning. The same set of physical and logical rules applies to every player much like in the real world. This is not the case with rocket league. Different physics apply to different players and the game adjusts these parameters to favor one side over the other about 90% of the time.How is the game rigged exactly? Two principal types of rigging apply in Rocket League Camera rigging and entity physics rigging. Camera rigging occurs when the action you see on your screen does not reflect the action that happens in the game. One of the most basic camera rigs in RL is the classic missing the ball trick. You charge towards the ball expecting a hit only to brush by wide left wide right too low or too high. Or you hit the ball at the incorrect contact point. This is NOT a bug. This is NOT (always) due to lack of skill in fact highly skilled players miss these shots because Rocket League's piece of junk Ballcam (otherwise known as Shitcam) can and does generate optical illusions at will. This is one way RL rigs the game against you increasing the chances that you miss your shots or miss the ball entirely.The second type of rigging comes from a tweaking of the game physics themselves. One common scenario in RL is when two players hit the ball at the same time. Rocket league uses physics to calculate the path of the ball following the collision. However it can choose from not one but several paths within a degree of uncertainty. One path might head towards the center of the field. Another might head straight into your goal. You as the player can't tell the difference because all of those paths look valid given the physics of the game. But in real life the several paths scenario is complete and utter t much like most of Rocket League. RL *deliberately* selects the path that will conform to the way the game is rigged whether it's against you or for you. If you have saved replays of matches you suspect are rigged I urge you to look at them and in slow motion. You will begin to notice that some ball touches don't look right. The trajectory of the ball is too high too low too slow too fast etc. It's not you. It's Psyonix (Shytonix) who has stacked the odds against you.There's a third type of rigging but it's not really rigging. Just players cheating and believe me there are plenty enough to feed to all the starving zoo lions in the world. Cheats seen frequently in the game include Speed hacks noticeable when the player is twice the distance from the ball as you are and somehow is able to hit the ball at 100 kph into your goal even though you clearly hit the ball away from them first. Speed hacks can affect dodge speed boost speed or both. Aimbot hard to spot but used by low skill players who want to impress you with their fake (completely cheated) aerial skills and impossible angle shots Auto Demolition which decreases the speed at which you need to hit an opponent to make them explode. The dead giveaway here is to watch low speed collisions turn into BOOMs. Anti demolition the opposite of the above where a player can avoid being exploded even when the opponent rams into the player at the highest velocity possible. Again easily spotted from replaysNow would you really like to pay $20 to play a game that's rigged from the getgo and infested with cheaters? Your choice ),Rocket League®

2016-06-13,0,0,551,False,Recommended,"Rocket League has a special spot for me in games. It was the first game I ever really tried to play competitively. Do I regret it? No. If you don't know the premise of the game well what rock have you been living under? Anyway it's a pretty basic concept. You hit the ball in the goal. As you progress in the game you will realize that it is a hell of a lot more than hitting a ball into a goal (if you get that far I know people who just play for a couple hours). If you don't get too in depth who cares? It is a fun little game and not everyone has to be the best. That is one problem I see with games like this. Especially in League of Legends. Mainly if you are a ""casual"" 90% of the community looks down on you. This issue is pretty much non existent in rocket league. The main thing that was holding me back from wanting to be decent at League of Legends was the simple fact that if you test something new or start playing a new character and don't do extrememly well you team flames the living out of you depending on how toxic they are. On the topic of toxic communities every game has them. Rocket League is no exeption however I do feel like there are lots of nice players in the community that are willing to help you get better. Or if you are just having fun you won't get flamed. Overall I have found a lot of friends to play this game with just by adding them on my friends list. All of them are really decent people. Besides a few bad apples the community is fairly decent.The gameplay has more depth than someone just looking at it might think. Some of the stuff very good players looks easy on paper but it is insanely hard to pull off especially when you are against an equally good team. Anyone who has tried to ""pick up"" this game knows what I'm talking about. The view of this game as a casual is no different than someone who try hards every game. The matchmaking system in casual games is surprisingly good. Every time I searched when I was a pro or vetran I got matched with someone at my level. Does that mean you win every game? No but it gave me a good fun and most of all close game. Overall if you play this game avidly or just play it once every 3 months you will have a good time.

But some reason I started to get OK at it right away.My first two games were rusty after that I am the king of the show! I scored 2 goals on third game first I went against AI they scored in their own goal multiple times... then I went online had terrible lag and connection turned down quality and made it only my area. then online worked great! I think I am doing realy well! I love doing flips and stuff to score! I did a bicicle kick and it went into their goal! I think I already got the hang of the gameplay love it! So glad I bought this game!y!Only complain is this is not on mac yet.Edit ITS MAC NOW11/10Would body slam sombody about to score again.,Rocket League®

2017-07-07,0,0,4,False,Not Recommended,I could never really get into this game no matter how hard I tried. A slick and futuristic graphics design and ok ish music do not excuse a game that is boring and lackluster at its core. Its like soccer but made even more barebones by having cars instead of players which limits your movement and strategy. You still just chase that ball around hoping for a goal and sure you can ride the walls to some extent but it is very hard to score goals that way. The only fun this game offers is if you are crazy good at it doing trickshots and flips but I see no reason to waste your time getting there.,Rocket League®

It can take time or you take to it straight away!The only negative this game has at this moment in time is that the servers are constantly going down.

Virtually unsurpassable entertainment that will have you crying from laughing too hard and screaming with elation as your team scores.

2017-03-25,0,0,377,False,Not Recommended,Ok let me start off by saying this. If you got a great PC and the time to learn every little aspect in the game fun as If your on a low end PC such as myself this is the worst game for you to get. Imma start by saying this was meant to be soccer with cars which it still is sorta. When they added hockey game mode was excited ok not a bad addition so i stuck with it loved it. Ok coming out with maps with ramps and two goals oh wait what is this $hiet?? Frames were a little lower than usual but manageable because I loved the game was still willing to tolerate it. Then aquadome is released the biggest piece of crap map to exist literally a frame murdering pyschopathic $hiet fest. I still love the game at this point but aggravated they would make a map that disreguards all low end PC's. Then they come out with arcbase the 2nd most frame murdering map but is more manageable still easily playable ok just another map i have to leave when I join a game and see it. Still loving it added a feature that lets you pick maps you prefer only one down side the maps you dont prefer you still get and can only dislike 2 of them. That update infuriated me to no end and I made it a point to some people and they said Ok will look into it. Nothing happened for the longest time and still has not. Last thing on my $hiet rant... If your on a low end PC dont bother touching this game it will be a huge let down to you. Only reason I am probably still gonna play this is private matching with friends devs destroyed my hope of ever playing comp on there as well as Playing daily,Rocket League®

There's lots of customization for your car and lots of fun new gamemodes to try out! If you're into games with competitive seasons then you'll enjoy this game. There is a crate system (basically loot boxes) and after some games you can get a crate. In order to open them though you have to pay money to buy keys to access the suprise that's inside. The developers are extremely active by adding new DLC's crates items and other fun stuff for us to enjoy. Other than that it's a pretty awesome mashup game that I'd highly reccomend!,Rocket League®

2017-12-13,0,0,303,False,Not Recommended,I loved playing this before the social justice update but... Now I see people complaining about bad performance from updates too? None of my friends are playing with it in this condition. This a n t iharrassment system that enables more of what it is trying to prevent is stupid and shouldn't exist. Online Bans are supposed to be for foulplay cheaters and hackers not for protecting your safe space. For unsportsman like play or chat griefing I feel if it is actually the programmers responsibility to protect you from negative online interactions to that extent it should only be through utilities like individualized blocklists or blacklisted matchmaking servers for rude uncooperative or frequent afk players to play amongst themselves. It's unreasonable to revoke service without breaking any agreed terms and I did not see my fellow players permanent happy mentality in the ToS. I literally haven't played ANY randoms or used any crate keys since they added bans because I feel anxious that BS would happen to me. Simply because matchmaking is such random unbalanced crap unfair games are not fun and leave children salty and report happy.. If that happens to me I will likely never play again period. In the mean time I feel better leaving it alone permanently of my own volition and only playing IF friends I know who won't do that EVER play again. So far no luck..,Rocket League®

2017-03-15,0,0,244,False,Not Recommended,I've had this game quite some time and I figured that I should share my view about the game.I hate it. I like car games and football games in general. This game was fun first but I got sick of it when I had about 60 80 hours in the game.I've tried to start liking it since some of my friends plays it but I can't do it. I'm usually calm and goofy when I play games but this game just frustrates me a lot. I get mad and quit the game almost every time I play it. Community that I've met are total faces. I had to remove whole chat from the game. I've never even thought about removing chat window in any other game. I like chatting with random fellas. With rocket league the community is so toxic and the chat is filled with ridicilous spam. I couldn't handle that. It annoyed me so much.Casual gamemode is not fun for the most parts. I haven't been playing it for a long time. If I remember correctly the balance was bad and there were many leavers. Ranking system is really bad in my opinion. There are so many players misranked in rising star rank. You can really see it clearly that some players in the same rank play completely different game. Today I played 4 matches in a row and it was complete mismatch every game. I get easily bored if enemies are playing really bad. Also many times I feel like I'm playing against really good players and lose a crushing defeat. I don't really mind losing to good players since it gives me the opportunity to learn more and get better. But again. Mismatch.I don't like the weird lucky stuff in the game but hey maybe someone thinks it's the game's feature and belongs in it. I'm just one stupid guy with opinions.I really can't recommend this game. I just despise it so much I had to write this review. That at least tells me a lot.,Rocket League®

An entire nation of people wanting to show pride in their country has to have their pride degraded by their country not even being referred to by its own name. Can you imagine the uproar if they listed the United States flag as ""British North American Colonies""? Regarding gameplay I love it but the blood and tears shed in the past over this outrageous naming convention (Chinese Taipei) makes me say that for such a ""minor"" little thing (is the United States flag a *minor* thing to you?

Say if you are in Plat but belong in Diamond you will never get out of plat because rocket league will just match you with smurfs and people who should also be in diamond but because of teammates or just the fact they don't come against Plat players and instead Diamond players. They base yourr rank off of wins and not performance. often time you will wins multiple games in a row and not go u a division but after your 6 game win streak you will lose one game and go down a division or sometimes win a game and still go down a divsion but you can't lose a game and go up a division. Rocket Leagues servers are just full of smurfs and players who don't belong in the rank you are in making it hard to go up a rank once you make it to gold and unless you are a lucky youtuber you wont get any good teammates that will drag you down make you lose and despite playing well it will make you go down a division.

2017-05-05,0,0,851,False,Recommended,Simply put Rocket League is a new and unique take on an old game. Soccer is already the most widely played sport in the world so why not add cars that can play soccer? That is exactly what the creators of Rocket League have done. The high speed game puts you in the driver s seat and tells you to hit the ball into the goal. It is easily one of my favorite games to play because of the pure and simplistic nature of the game.The developers have done really well with the game. There is very few if any bugs and most of them have to do with the actual servers. They have focused on perfecting the mechanics and balancing everything out for the best possible experience. The game itself is not a hard one to learn while some of the more acrobatic moves may be harder everything comes in due time. The use of cross platform integration is also another really great addition that shows that the developers care. Being able to play with your friend on an Xbox or PS4 means that you no longer have to buy a console to play with them. In general it is evident that the developers care for the game.Unlike other games on Steam the skins and other cosmetic features in Rocket League aren t a cancer to the game. For the most part the cosmetic features have no actual monetary value and while you can by keys for cases that drop in game you can t actually sell the items on the Steam Community Market. However the addition of some cars via DLC has caused distress due to the fact that some cars hitboxes are bigger than others. This gives players an unfair advantage by paying for certain DLCs because it allows them more surface to hit the ball. While most people don t mind it is on occasion that you will encounter someone salty about it after a loss.Sometimes the smallest things are what make a game and Rocket League is not short of small features. Similar to CS GO s GOTV Rocket League s replay system allows for watching your best games. In addition the replay feature also has automatic cinematic features that will track the ball or a player of your choosing. While the functionality of watching matches live is pretty exclusive the spectator option is viable especially for live streamers. Additionally Rocket League is full of other small features including Car presets tutorials built in training workshop integration and many other features.Game modes in Rocket League are also another one of its strong suits. Obviously the soccer or Soccar is the main selling point but games like basketball and hockey allow for some variety. Of course moving away from traditional sports the Rumble a derby with power up variant of Soccar and Dropshot where the floor is broken by the ball till the point that it falls through the floor showcases the best features of the game.With the addition of game modes comes new maps to play them on. Like most games there are a variety of different maps to play on and Rocket League is no exception. Most of the maps are simple rounded rectangular pitches with boosts spaced out and two goals at either end however this convention was broken with the addition of Wasteland that featured a slight slope on either side as it neared the wall allowing for a variety of new tactics to test out. Neo Tokyo changed the convention once again by adding two raised sections on the sides of the map. It was changed once more with Starbase Arc which instead of a rectangle was an octagon. All of these maps were tested prior to their release for competitive play in Rocket Labs play menu which currently features and tests additions the developers want to add.While the addition of new maps gets some people excited others aren t to happy. At the forefront users who have played Starbase Arc aren t too happy with the shape as the ball bounces differently on the angles and because the map is substantially bigger. To combat this the game has implemented a pseudo veto feature that allows you to vote not to play that map granted other players in the game will also have to veto the same map for it to be removed from the queue.Many features in the game are good however one of the biggest problems that plague the game is the abandoning in the middle of competitive play. While the developers have implemented a 15 minute suspension from playing any online game mode competitive or not this is not really a deterrent for most. Additionally the ELO system in the game is broken and like most games it can take you 2 games to derank and 10 games to rank up. To combat this the developers introduced divisions inside the actual rank giving you not only a more general idea of your overall rank but also seeing how close you are to demotion.In general the game is free of major game breaking glitches and bugs. The development team takes great care of the game and for the most part it is very entertaining to play. Overall the game is a 9/10 because of the mastery exemplified in the simplistic yet mechanically complex nature of the game. In all honesty the game would have received a 10/10 however I felt that some issues need to be properly addressed first. Altogether however the game is worth the price in fact I would say that the price is perfect for what the game is.,Rocket League®

2016-03-03,0,0,84,False,Recommended,I've played more of this game than I realized. It sucks you in with 5 minute matches and frenetic aggrivating at times gameplay. Super fun and has me screaming at the screen so much (in good ways and bad). All that said there really isn't too terribly much here. I got it on sale for around 10$ and I don't know that I'd have paid much more than that. All the unlocks are cosmetic same with ALL the DLC. So...sure I'll pay 2$ to drive around the BTTF Delorean but that's not why you're going to keep playing this.The learning curve can be steep for some it definitely keeps you learning and trying to just be aware of where the ball and other players are so you can set up plays and position yourself in the best places.Ranked matches can be brutal the competition can be intense but it's also a ton of fun to invest in getting good at the game.7/10 good lightweight fun that can be taken to absurd levels.,Rocket League®

2016-11-01,1,1,528,False,Recommended,This is a game that I'd recommend for anyone that wants to just have fun with friends. It is basically a perfect mixture of a car game and a football game. If you think however that this game is a football game like FIFA you should not buy the game. This game is again a game not as fun when played alone but with friends it is a bunch of fun. From my experience I'd always play this on a big TV screen with a controller rather than on a keyboard as this certainly works way better with a controller. I encountered some problems while trying to get my controller to work but it was easily fixed with some help from the Steam Discussions. Whether you play with the kayboard or a controller stick wit hone of them. It's really hard to switch when you're already up and running.I like that the game has a bunch of vehicles to choose from and quite a lot of customizing options for them as well. If you like the mixture this game offers I'd recommend buying it.Quite a good game 8 5/10**EDIT**Now that I've gotten a bit more into the game's competitive aspect I really have to say that it beats the casual playstyle I talked about in this review previously. Of course everyone has their own opinion but I think the game is best played with a friend or two when playing competitive. Except for Rumble. Nothing beats Rumble.,Rocket League®

Hardware Requirements A stone tablet should be able to run it Minimum Average High End Quantum Computing may not be enoughAlso thanks to Unreal Engine this game doesn't require much of any sort of serious hardware. The graphics settings are vastly tweak able so pretty much any system should be able to run this game no problem. Bugs None to report Some but still completely playable Several annoying bugs UnplayableEvery now and then you'll find a bug with the game but these bugs usually appear fresh from a major update and are usually patched up pretty quickly in hotfixes. Unlike most developers Psyonix cares a lot about this game. Audience Fetus (&gt 0) Kids (&gt 4) Everyone (&gt 8) Teenagers (&gt 13) Adults (&gt 18) Casual players Pro playersI'd like to see your newborn son destroy Turbopolsa Lethamyr Sizz GarrettG or any other recurring competitive player in RLCS. Some people are just gifted at this game including fetuses (fetii? Irrelevant). Skill Level Better make this your day job Sweaty neckbeards galore Requires reasonable effort Minuscule effort Just look at the screen and you winThis is the one category that doesn't really matter. Anyone can play this game and enjoy it... except for maybe some vehicular sports haters. If you're competitive sometimes you'll do the carrying and sometimes you'll get carried. If you're a casual gamer just relax and enjoy the game. Miscellaneous Fair warning beware of toxic people. But that's to be expected in any competive game.",Rocket League®

2017-10-04,0,0,368,False,Not Recommended,Very fun game. Worth the price.EDIT Don't buy this game or as Psyionix now says license this game. Their new updated agreement requires you to forfeit your ownership in the game saying that you are only buying the license to play the game not to own it so at any given time they can take that license away and take all of your stuff with it unless you transfered it before they revoked your license.A lot of people might not care about this but this is terrifying and more and more games are starting to do this. They basically never want you to own anything but instead buy a subscription to a game so they are not tied up to your purchase.This is extremely shady and if I knew they were going to do this I would've never bought their repetitive stupid microtransaction infested piece of game.20$ for a ing license to play a game is outrageous. you Psyionix go to hell you greedy bastards.,Rocket League®

2015-08-26,0,0,54,False,Recommended,It's rocket cars wot are playing soccer. Now consider your reaction to that and then know that whether that sentence sounds utterly brilliant or heartbreakingly stupid is irrelevant. This is the greatest game about cars playing footie the world has ever known or likely will know and it will lay its hooks into you in an instant like only the best games can. This is because there's one extra twist to this (I'm going to hell for this) CARtoon premise These things can JUMP. Not just useless little hops like so many kart based games either (and there is a lot of karting in this game's DNA) no sir these things DOUBLE JUMP in any direction hurling the very concept of inertia to the ground beneath them and farting triumphantly in its abstract face! The end result is less vehicular mayhem and more litter of overexcited puppies going after a giant soccer ball and the fact it's still a bunch of tiny toy cars in hats leaping about makes it an only slightly less adorable thing to watch. You'll feel the psychological benefit most acutely while you're getting bashed and bludgeoned into tiny bits in the best traditions of both soccer and NASCAR. There are some teething troubles with matchmaking but early days etc. and quitters will probably always be a problem but other than that I have nothing negative to say about this game it's a beautiful thing on every level.

2018-08-29,0,0,782,False,Recommended,Overall this game is absolutely phenomenal. Probably one of the only games without a skill cap as everything is constantly evolving and new stuff is discovered everyday. Besides the little glitches here and there the only issue with this game is smurfing. This is obvious in any game with competitive and seeing how this is picking up significant traction and one of the best games you can play (objective) that relies solely on skill. Due to this however people are consistently smurfing in competitive (mostly 1v1 and sometimes 2v2). I dont understand the reasoning for this seeing how freeplay is a viable option with more than enough people in it. Most of the time it is C1 C3 who cant advance any further and practice aerial control and new mechanics. Theres no issue with this but its kind of off putting especially to newer players. Other than that and the occasional toxic player this game is one of a kind.Recent updates involving how XP was given and the Rocket pass are very disappointing. Understanding they're trying to revamp the game and give people more of a reason to play is nice and all but the new XP distribution focuses mostly on goals and saves and if you only play support youre getting half the XP as you did previously. The Rocket Pass is too much of a grind. 100 hours in 3 months seems reasonable however most people dont have more than 1500 or even 1000. Using myself for example I have almost 800 hours in. If I wanted to achieve the full Rocket Pass I would have to put an 1/8th of the time I already had in. This game is a fun pick up and play game but I doubt people want to sit and play for 4 hours a day for 25 days ball chasing to get enough xp for each tier.,Rocket League®

The game works well the cars handle about how you would expect and that's all I can really say. That being said the game also doesn't offer a whole lot. It only takes about 30 minutes of gameplay to see everything the game has to offer. All that comes after that is trying to master the game which would take quite some time. The game is easy to learn and hard to master which can certainly be appealing to some people but I find there isn't enough in the game to recommend.

People consistently throwing the game with new accounts just to people off and put them in lower ranks. Unless you plan to ONLY play with others that you know ranked play is toxic for solo. The fact RL just lets this continue without addressing it is frustrating. This game is not Solo friendly at all in that aspect. You get punished for it because of these players.

At first I got a laggy main menu because graphics were set to Ultra by default. Then I changed my configuration to the lowest specs possible which made main menu navigation possible. The moment I enter any kind of match the game freezes and I have to restart my computer with Alt+SysRq+B. Also it's laggy no matter what. I have &lt 2 hours of ""gameplay"" (because I can't play) so I am considering a refund. Can you do something about the Linux release please? All of my other games work fine under Linux so this game is the exception rather than the rule.",Rocket League®

2016-05-12,2,6,485,False,Not Recommended,"This is by far not an entirely negative review but a statement of current player base. It is ever increasingly full of poison and salt derivated from LoL. Make a single mistake or even play well and do good passes and you will be cried upon by someone who has done far less for the team simply because of reason I cannot explain. There is plenty of fun to be had in unranked and with friends but play alone in solo ranked or with ""strangers"" as in non RL steam friends and you eventually will be so salty that not even the lobsters will want a taste of your remaining corpse.I was an all star and saw a quick purple sign before passing down again. I've gradually spiraled down to gold because of a chain of random salty people refusing to play well as they are more concerned with crying at your play regardless of being good or bad simply because it somehow contradicts their expectations from you. Perhaps they are offensive players and wish for you to camp in the goal all round perhaps they are supportive players trying to make passes and due to a sad childhood immediately rages on if not a 100% of their passes are perfectly picked up on every single time or maybe they're just tired after a 10 hour long shift at work with annoying customers and a baby that simply just won't stay quiet. Regardless of the circumstances play enough and you'll find yourself in a worse mood after logging off than before logging in.This league is nothing but a rocket full of salt eager to take off into oblivion.Though if you are able to not be upset by the unecessary and often unwarranted salty behavior Rocket League is an absolutely magnificent game with countless of hours of fun.",Rocket League®

Otherwise? More frustration than anything else on 1v1 or queuing solo standard with randoms which mainly destroy the game. Why is 1vs1 so bad than? Kind of boring repeating strategies with people literally camping every corner until you make the slightest mistake and counter you onto that after that you cant get to the ball when it slowly rolls inside of your goal without any skill needed I like to play a game for fun not for tryharding at 1v1.,Rocket League®

2018-07-05,0,0,539,False,Recommended,"Rocket League is one of those rare games who've got the ""from zero to hero"" 's ideology.I still remember playing it one week after its release if I still remember it was released 5th July 2015 and I started playing it since 15 July 2015 on the cracked version (yeah I know I was still a poor young guy who doesn't follow the law) It was really a fun game and even nowadays still funny but not like before why? Simply I was discovering it by myself I got my actual skills thanks to the many games against pro bots (I loose often to all stars that's why) but after years and few months I decided it to buy the game 'cause I started getting bored from bots even I up to date the cracked version either of it I liked snowday and Hoops pretty much but it's time to shine on multiplayer. So I added Rocket League to my games list on 26th September 2016 at the end of Rumble's era ( . So from now on I play the game legally and without the updating's pain but i'm facing now another type of pain and it's community. Really I discovered that the PC community is too toxic and either my connection was bad (and still worse even with updating the MB) which means I experienced the ragequit for the first time in Rocket League . I'm not generalizing things but I concluded from season 4 that the ranking system is broken and unfair IDK but I can't believe a bronze skilled guy would be in Gold and Platinum. Regardless many players found out about that and Psyonix tried to improve their skills by adding costume training and adding the MMR's deal. But I cannot end my review with talking about the features they add a good car then a bad car good one and then a bad one but now they only post bad ones due to running out of ideas I liked much the Batmobile and Dominus they are just .... M A S T E R P I E C E ! And the soundtracks OOOOH MAAAN ! they add only dope ones before but now they collaborated with Monstercat and imagine the ball is music and Monstercat and Psyonix playing against us on a unfair match Monstercat (team) I got it! Psyonix (team) All yours! Psyonix Holy cow ! Psyonix What a play ! Psyonix Nice shot ! Chat disabled for 3 seconds. Monstercat Thanks!

Really designer shoot long of matches. You feel progress. Probably the most fun to money invested ratio in my games library. Simple concept easy to understand but hard to master (for someone p). Dream from young times. If you wanna play with brother/mate youn need only controllers and keyboard. Enjoy this beauty of a game. Definately RECOMMENDED,Rocket League®

2017-08-18,0,0,152,False,Recommended,"When I was 18 I was a stereotypical socially awkward nerd. I had really sh i t luck with women and I was afraid of each and every girl I came across. I was a virgin as well. I had only kissed a couple girls not much other than that to be honest. My best friend Liam always got women. He always told me that talking to girls was easy and not scary at all just don't be a scared little dog and do it. I always wished I had his confidence. I asked for help to get a girlfriend/someone to so I wouldn't be a virgin finally. He said he'd help me I was so damn happy and scared at the same time.So one day he decided to take me to a party he was going to. He was content on getting me laid finally. I was nervous asf. I had a few drinks and I saw a girl I thought was a solid 8/10. A little feral though. Liam saw me looking at her and laughed. I asked him what was funny and instead he pushed me into the same girl. I apologised and was freaking out. Liam came over and said ""This here is my boy he acts shy but he's a ing god. Treat him right."" and took off elsewhere. The girl giggled and told me her name was Olivia. Even thought my autism kicked in and I was a complete idiot we hit it off. A guy she knew came over and told her to come have a smoke with him. She said yes as he grabbed her hand and started walking off. She asked me if I smoked I have never but I said yes anyway cause I wasn't letting this dog take her away from me. I inhaled my first cigarette and naturally I had a coughing fit. They laughed but it was all good. 1 year after that party I was dating Olivia. She took my virginity and we hit it off. I started smoking more often because why not life was good. I loved her more than I will anything. At least it was until Olivia dumped me. Olivia cheated on me with Liam. Multiple times. The love of my life and my best mate.I became immensly depressed and started chain smoking. At least a pack a day. I did this for a solid 7 months. One day I started to feel a pain whenever I took a deep breath. I myself. I went to to doctor's to find out what was happening. I was so damn worried. My doctor said they'd call me with results after a short time.After a week my doctor called me up with some results. I was freaking the out at this point. He said I was all clear and lucky because my cells defended my body before cancer could take affect. I cried for 3 days out of relief. I beat cancer. Just for Rocket League to give it back to me.",Rocket League®

You can play competitive where you have ranks and the higher the rank the harder the players are. There are multiple gamemodes. There is rumble which you have power ups snowday where you play on one map and a puck instead of a ball and rocket labs where you play on cool maps... But don't forget Hoops! It is basket ball.

This is why I lost a few of my games when I play rank. 2)No buddy invites yet for ps4/pc but I hear they are working on a solution(reading through articles and stuff not 100% sure if its true) 3) mechanics are really hard to learn and master play tutorial and free roam mode thing Can't really think of anymore cons but great game 8/10. If the rank system is a little better might get a better score. I wouldn't mind bots replacing my teams it's better than 1v3.,Rocket League®

2015-09-13,0,0,219,False,Not Recommended,"I gave this game dozens upon dozens of hours to change my mind and I can only come away with a negative impression.It controls nicely. Its netcode is solid given the ludicrous amount of traffic. The concept needless to say is original and brilliant.And then you realize you actually have to sit down and play.At times this game will make you want to disembowel yourself with the nearest dull object within reach. The matchmaking in this game is perfectly streamlined to provide you with the most insufferable caustic simpleminded oxygen thieves that the human race has to offer. You will be unable to predict your teammates' movements so don't even try. Half the time they will turn and intentionally score on your goal just to torment a new player.In advanced and competitive play there's a technical term ""pinching"" which involves two players colliding with the ball from two different angles simultaneously. If legitimate physics applied something would break buckle or crumble but since everything in this game is indestructible the ball goes flying at hundreds of kilometers per hour. This one phenomenon cracks the physics engine wide open and makes the game look like a half baked beta. At least sixty percent of goals scored in ranked mode are due to ""pinches"" because no one can move fast enough to block them and with inordinate frequency they end up landing square in the center of someone's goal.This game is not about skill. It's about luck at least immediately after being a terrible terrible person.The only reason I haven't had this game permanently removed from my account refund be damned is because I don't know if it will delete my review. I want as many negative reviews to stay up as possible.",Rocket League®

I can always fall back to Rocket League whenever I ""don't know what to play"".I've purchased this game twice first discovering it through PS Plus. I probably have a similar amount of hours on the PS4 as I do on Steam.I thoroughly approve of how Psyonix has handled keys/crates. Pure customization no competitive advantage by spending money. This is a fantastic game and you will never regret purchasing it (except maybe after going on a 10 game losing streak in ranked).Addendum I've noticed an increase in negative reviews because of their automated ban system. Just wanted to mention that I've never been banned on either platform nor have any of my friends.

I really enjoy playing this game If my friend hadn't have bought it for me I would be missing out on soooo much It's a game that u can get better at. If you play for a good amount of time on ur downtime u will see ur self get better. When I started to play I was really bad and I look at the vids I used to have about this game and they are horrible compared to now you can really grow in this game. I definetly give this is a thumbs up overall. But what I didn't know is that my pc can't really handle this game on certain maps that would be the downside for me it got really annoying because on maps like Starbase or Western my pc just could not handle the lag It was frustrating to play but fortunately I will be getting a new pc and I hope that will improve my gameplay! So if you are going to get this game be sure you have a good pc for it! But like I said overall this is a good game. D,Rocket League®

You only want to make practice but the community doesn't let you to do so.Sometimes the connection doesn't let you play and the game turns a nightmare and you just get frustrated.The matchmaking is also a problem. After winning two or three matches your opponent is way better than the previous one There is a huge difference between two matches if you keep winning several times.A serious edit after a couple games This game's community just shows us how bad a community can ever be!

2018-03-29,0,0,15,False,Recommended,Where do I begin Rocket League is truly a game like no other. Unlike other types of games such as the fps genre where your prior skill in the genre helps you adapt to game your new to Rocket League doesn't.If your looking for a game you can play with a couple of friends and really grind and practice to see your self get to that level of skill you want to be at this is it.Nobody is good when they start but its easy to get a hold of and just as hard to master the mechanics because players are always finding new ways to score goals.Im terrible at this game but I keep coming back because this game isn't just about rising through the ranks or being at the top of the leaderboard its about testing yourself... Every shot every wall dribble and every fake is the result of practice and reading your opponents theres hardly any RNG and nothing feels better then getting a shot you've been trying to get for hours days or even weeks. This is because the game is hard but it never gets old or too difficult.Devs care about community and are trying to be more transparent. So get ready for some What A Save! 's and some trash talk but I know you can handle yourself I hope you get this game and I hope maybe we can play a few games.But for real buy this game! 9/10 Wish there were more items you could get without loot boxes,Rocket League®

Devs are becoming more and more greedy for money while providing nothing in return. Guess what. You can reach champion while being complete trash in real life. You dont even need 70iq to achieve this. This game is all about addiction. People are spending thousands of hours playing this trash. The sooner you realise that you are addicted the better for you. This game is all about playing (wasting your time) as much as you can so you can reach balls faster (WOW HIGH QUALITY GAMEPLAY RIGHT THERE LMAO). The worst part of it is the matchmaking. When u're playing solo queue you can play against premade players (20% of time one of them is smurfing) while in your team you get someone who got carried by his friend/ booster (the same way as that enemy player) and now solo queues so he plays like trash. OH WELL! Too bad you will lose 10mmr points as the enemy team's smurf was 2 ranks below AND YOU SHOULD HAVE WON THAT GAME AS HIS RANK WAS LOWER THAN YOURS while you gain 7mmr for usual win ) What a beautiful game rocket league is.

Over and over I found myself paired against people with far more experience than me and let me tell you it's not fun losing over and over when you don't even understand the wonky control scheme. I got a few chuckles but overall not a game I would suggest until the devs figure out their matchmaking.,Rocket League®

2017-11-25,0,0,32,False,Not Recommended,I do not recommend this game as the ranking system makes the game unejoyable. If a teammate leaves mid match it is nearly impossibly to win yet this still effects your ranking. The person who leaves is banned shortly yet they do not discount the match for the losing team even though they are acknowledging it makes the match unfair. The game itself is fun but this system takes away the competitive aspects. Also it is nearly impossible to rank up because one loss brings you down but takes 3 wins to move up. They should take notes on how Overwatch does there system.,Rocket League®

After racking up more than 1200 hours gameplay since November I still feel like I'm learning the game.I think that's the beauty of this game it's so accessible to a wide range of players and their skill levels and the game just keeps on giving. The in game community are fantastic and a few of the ""pro"" players stream on Twitch so there's always a way to interact.The gameplay is fantastic and the physics and mechanics of the game allow for a wide variety of manoevures and skills to be learned over time. It is also a very aesthetically pleasing game so a big shout out to the arty guys at Psyonix. For those that want to take the game more seriously there are several tournaments every week with prizes Gfinity Mockit and ESL spring to mind straight away not to mention the Rocket League Championship Series that is currently underway.The level of customisation for your car is also impressive although I do wish there were more colours and decals to choose from!Overall an extremely fun game that you can play casually or seriously with friends you know or friends you don't. It's a game that just keeps on giving.David (the world's worst Rocketeer)",Rocket League®

2017-07-10,0,0,69,False,Not Recommended,Let me start of by saying I have had hours of fun playing this game. I have also had hours of truly awful gameplay. This used to be a great game. I would have recommended it several years ago. It's fun. It's easy to drop into. It gets regular free updates. What's not to love right? Well the problem is that you are only as good as the people it pairs you up with. Here is the problem. The game is a victim of its own success. I would say at least 75% of the time once the first goal is scored someone on the now losing team will just quit the game. They will write it off and move on to the next match. I would say at least 33% of the time I go to join a match and get slotted into a team that is down 7 0 with 3 minutes left in a match.Everyone seems to just accept this and point out that ranked play solves this problem. I've also been told to just play with friends. I bought this for some casual fun where I just drop in as needed. Scheduling with friends is not that. I just want to casually play a game for fun and blow off steam. This game used to be amazing at that. It might some day return to that state. I actually hope it does because the developers are basically doing everything else right. Until then this game is not recommended.,Rocket League®

On one hand the reviews from just about everyone have been positive which is hard to ignore however everything I saw Pictures Gameplay videos and the like just didn't seem appealing at all. I don't like soccer and I hardly like racing games.. so I put this game on the backburner of things to buy.Welp when I finally decided to buy it and launched my first session was 4 hours long. This game is super addicting. It has all the right elements simple to learn yet still having the desire to get better competitive yet casual unlockables that are interesting and make you want to keep playing. All in all it's a blast. If you were like me and on the edge about this game you're doing yourself a disservice by not buying it. Believe the hype.,Rocket League®

Almost as cancerous as League.I would recommend this game but it depends if you can stomach a basic ranked system that is un refined and requires a lot of grinding to advance through tiers along with a toxic online community. Very few players understand communication and playing with a teammate. If you have someone to play with then it's insanely fun. I would highly suggest staying away from solo que all together.Outside of online play there is very little for solo play. The game offers a Season mode which you compete against AI in anywhere from 1v1 to 4v4 and an exhibition mode with adjustable modifiers to the match that are interesting but not very deep. Overall this is an online game with nothing much else to offer. If playing with other people is not your strong suit then stay away.,Rocket League®

2018-06-27,0,0,460,False,Recommended,"Rocket League is one of those games that generates its fan base and popularity off of raw gameplay. No story no interesting characters just pure gameplay. It's difficult to play this game for the first time and set the controller down just 30mins later. This statement also holds true whether you've played the game for 1 hour or 1000 hours. It's that good. It never gets old and it never stops being fun unless you run into the occasional human being who isn't to friendly towards others. There's quite a few of them who plague this game and sometimes it sucks. But hey that's life for ya.The best games out there (video games or not) all follow 1 common quote ""Easy to learn and difficult to master"". Just about anyone and their grandmother can pick this game up and have fun with it on their own level. But wanna git gud? Then just take one look at some of the Rocket League pros they got gud and they all started off the same as we did and so can you. It's crazy to think I debated for weeks on whether paying $20 for some silly car game was worth my money. Well that ""silly car game"" has become my most played game ever.Buy it on sale or not you wont reget it.The only reget you may have (like I did) is that you didn't buy it sooner.",Rocket League®

I would highly recommend using a controller while playing because it is easier however using keyboard and mouse is just as fun. The only thing that lowers my liking of the game is that there haven't been many new game modes released recently (Probably because they are hard to make) and the game has slowly added more and more things that require money to get (Keys and DLC). I don't mind this however because it is not compulsory to have fun and part of the money given goes to funding E Sport for rocket league. I would probably rate it 8 9 / 10.,Rocket League®

You'll have good games and some bad ones.

2017-03-08,0,0,132,False,Recommended,This game is one of those games that you can put hours into and still not master. It is easy to learn but hard to master.

2016-12-30,0,0,632,False,Not Recommended,Editted review Don't play. Non responsive customer service. Their patch broke the game two weeks ago. Performance is absolutely terrible with constant stutters on Ryzen 7 with a 1080ti. They take your money don't reply to you and stop caring. I wouldn't bother honestly. Every game is your teammates crashing into the backside of your car and not permitting you to control the ball or dribble because they are spastic selfish millenial morons who play soccer like 5 year olds that bunch around the ball.The training isn't fun because it forces you to watch a replay after every single attempt and/or suffer through a pointless countdown when all you want to do is be left free to practice but it makes it so tedious you don't want to bother.People throw matchse all the time but you're not allowed to leave or the ranking system penalizes you so you are effectively held hostage by Psyonix for 15 minutes of no fun while your teammate gives the other team goals.,Rocket League®

2016-11-19,0,0,233,False,Recommended,I loved it from the first time I played it. I remember how I spend 5 hours per day to play it. Is it much? Probably yes since I don't spend so much time playing just one game. What's so great about Rocket League? Probably everything. Starting how easy the gameplay is and how hard it is to win. Because of how small teams are every player's role is important. Without any teamplay you can't win sure to some point you can but that's not what Rocket League is about. Trying your best to defend attack and use every chance there will be to score climbing ladder in competetive matches and just having simply fun in hockey or basketball. I don't remember when I had last this much fun playing online game. Don't wait for sale discover fun of Rocket League today. It's not really high price for a game you could probably spend more than XXX hours into. There are also some DLCs but YOU DON'T NEED THEM TO ENJOY GAME and some kind of loot system similar to one in CS GO but I'm thankful it didn't reach Steam market.

You can change colour of your car use some textures unlock some seasonal ones put on silly hats rocket boost style and even scoring effect and wheels. Unfortunatly this is in major part locked in lootboxes*.Gameplay ballance least fair point of the whole review and one of major reasons for not recommandation This is almost entirely dependant on luck because the system either dose not have enough players and you wil end up in team that dominates or is being dominated (no neither is fun). it seems to be using some sort of avarage. To be fair this dose usually occurs when longer wait time in an effort to get the game running. My point here is taht i would personaly prefer either choice of longer wait or bgoradeing of search.* And now the obvious problem LOOTBOXES specificaly RNG boxes that do drop duplicates with joke ammounts of free keys being ofeered ony during seasonal events.As the game stands at the moment and on the EU version of the game you can NOT purchase the content of lootboxes directly you are fully at mercy of the RND (which i can not emphesize enough CAN give you duplicates hell there are even duplicates with different properties for example traisl behind wheels can track various stats and i have 2 sets of them where one tracks time played and one goals scored that is the entire difference). there are lootbox exclussives styles (for exampled very nice doted dynamic livierty which looks really pretty even entire vehicles).Yes i can not recommand the game based solely on the RNG as even i was seduced to buy extra keys... twice. Weak willed that is what i am. i will NOt just elave it like this i do have a suggested solution keep the RNG in but make it free lootboxess for achivement keys for free per x game played allow players to buy ANNYTHING directly you allready ahve some cars avalible to purchase so just use that system?additionall complains (but those coud just be me being usless) trading items from lootboxess has odd restrictions i am unable to freely trade the items one by one only en mass (5x items if you trade solo for one item of higher quality) even than it appears to be limited to quality and type of lootbox there are way too manny types of lootboxess btw. Being me i offcourse can not figure out anny other way to trade as mentioned this could be on me.You will dodge the whole ""just like EA"" paraller that ill draw here just to stab at something that should not be present on PTP game.in summary buy the game on discount hide the lootboxess in your menu and pray that your will is strong enough.expectgood quick (5min) matches to be your quick unwind after a day rather than sticking around the game for hours..or do as i recommand and on principle do NOT buy the game untill they fix the damned lootbox system.",Rocket League®

Visit rocket league reddit to see how bad it is. Addition to this is toxic community with insecure players. Very few normal people. Looks like they care only about money. One dlc costs 1/5 of full game price or you can buy 11 cars 2 each(yet... they are adding new cars often). I enjoyed it for first 100 200 hrs. It is fun but at the same time its not.

2016-04-23,0,0,665,False,Not Recommended,"The only saving grace of this game is the fact that it CAN be fun especially the first 50 hours or so. After that it just sinks from there. The worst part is probably that it seems like it has insane potential to be fun but it just never seemed to achieve that potential once I realized how bad the physics are and by how much bs there can be. Awful physics 80% of the time ball speed doesn't seem to be reliant on car speed at all and the luckiness of 75% of the goals made is unreal. Call me salty or bad or whatever other names you can think up but everyone one that has sunk at least 100 hours into this game knows how what I'm talking about. EDITThe game is still ""fun"" to play especially as a new player. The game developers seem intent on ruining the competitive playlist with the inclusion of maps like Wasteland and Neo Tokyo and the terrible competitive matchmaking system even after the October 2016 rank update.I'm not sure exactly how the competitive matchmaking system works but it only seems to account for the actual ranks (challenger rising star etc.) and not for the in game levels (like master legend etc.). Currently at All star 1 as a level 53 Master and all I see are legends and rocketeers with the occasional master and even more rarely an expert. I get limited enjoyment of the game because usually after about 4 games I have had enough of bs goals or unfair match ups. 11/10 Would get tilted againEDITI hardly play anymore and when I do I feel myself enjoying it less and less every time I play. Its now at the point where I maybe play two games regardless of the outcome and just get off. It has lost its luster and I already reminisce about the times when the game was enjoyable.",Rocket League®

2017-02-18,0,0,472,False,Recommended,Rocket League. A game which I watched from the outside grow in popularity more and more YouTubers began playing it but why? I just couldn't fathom what made all of these YouTubers suddenly encorporate this game into their daily schedule that is until I bought it.When I first bought the game I was playing on my Macbook Pro lowest settings with a terrible frame rate so it didn't look good at all. Yet when I first played the game and had no idea what I was doing I believe I spent every night for about a week straight just playing Rocket League I was hooked. The fast paced tense competitive yet friendly games that only took about 6 to 7 minutes each kepted me wanting more.The support both from the developers and community is amazing. Both are constantly and tirelessly working to improve the game. The level of communication and trust between the developers and players is truly admirable the developers constantly doing their best to fix issues keeping the players informed and implementing good features suggested by the community. Other publishers should defintely strive to achieve the same honesty transparency and integrity achieved by Psyonix.Word of advice for when you get the game get the Game of the Year edition as you will be happy to pay a bit extra and it saves buying some of the DLC you'll likely get later on. Also change your control scheme earlier rather than later and Turn Off Camera Shake!,Rocket League®

2015-08-12,0,0,86,False,Recommended,Controls obviously take a bit of getting used to in a game like this but once you get comfortable with them they feel pretty good. Overall it's a really good game as long as you play online. Don't play with computer controlled allies unless you want your blood pressure to go through the roof because the team AI loves dribbling the ball right into its own goal from downfield and knocking the ball into its own goal at every opportunity while on defense and constantly ruining really easy plays by smacking the ball back to your side of the pitch as you're about to score. In other words 3v3 season play is actually 5v1 and you're the always the 1 the exception being if you play on Rookie and win every game 30 to 0 because you can immediately knock the ball into the goal every time the opposing AI won't boost to it and it's really easy to hit in from half court. But online play is really good save for the occasional lag spike and even if your teammates suck at least they usually know which goal is theirs. If you insist on playing single player do yourself a favor and keep something cheap and soft around to pummel as you will likely feel incredible rage especially if you have viking ancestors.Disclaimer I wrote this after losing like three season games in a row due to incredible teammate fails my fury is legend,Rocket League®

But there are some pretty awesome players/teams out there too.Well worth the $$ if you ask me.P.S.

2017-04-02,0,0,148,False,Recommended,While i have enjoyed many a great hour playing this wonderful game. I have a simple complaint to make that strikes me at the base of my freedom. We as Rocket League players are being taxed in a great way. When i first purchased the game I was very pleased to play it and receive a mere 34 boost at start which was perfectly fine by me however after the latest update I noticed that we are being taxed for no apperent reason our boost starts at a mere 33 upon kickoff. Now I as an American firmly believe in no taxation without representation so I for one would like to know what kind of impoverished children my 1 boost is helping. Answer that Psyonix WHERE IS MY BOOST GOING???????,Rocket League®
2016-10-09,0,0,850,False,Not Recommended,It's a great game but think hard before you buy if you want to play on Linux. I've had it for a while now and multiplayer is pretty much broken. There seem to be some problems with the network code I was in a multiplayer game with a ping of 32 just now but the whole screen was pulsing in and out everything moving erratically. This has happened in every single game I've tried to play. It makes even seeing where the ball is impossible (to be honest I couldn't even tell where I was half the time stuff was just moving so weirdly). I guess sync errors with the servers but who knows. It also crashes extremely frequently (every 1 2 games) but even though the crash reporter fires a half dozen times a day for me they haven't patched the Linux client once as far as I can tell. It's hard to know if they're going to.Local exhibition play is okay but the bot AI is truly awful a weird mix of perfect ball prediction and absolutely awful play. I've watched the bots sit on their own goal line as the ball rolls past them without making any effort to save. The number of times one bot on a team will just get lost at the far end of the pitch for no reason. Or you'll be in the middle of a dribble (of sorts) and a bot on your own side will fly over you and pass to the opposition... Or you'll be 2 1 up with 10 seconds left and your side will suddenly decide to score an own goal under no pressure. It's way too frustrating to recommend paying money to play against the AI. Right now you're paying full price for a game that is well below alpha quality on Linux.,Rocket League®

2017-03-06,0,0,1210,False,Not Recommended,Rocket League is a game I've played way too much over the years it's fun it's adictive it's...repetetive it's...tedious.Rocket League for me when I first bought it was those first two things it was fun and addictive and I invested over 1 000 hours into the game. I loved the game and even though I wasn't very good (I'm still not very good) from the start there was something to aim for the ranking system. As you got better you progressed through the ranks and whenever you got to a rank at the end of a season you'd get a reward in game cosmetics to make your battle car look cooler and more appealing than a plain blank car. This gave you an insentive to play more and eventually pay real money to invest in microtransactions and so so much DLC.However as I played more and more into the game I found it very repetive and it got so tedious as to the point that I took a month break from the game. I came back refreshed and I enjoyed it again and thought nothing of it. As more time went by I found the game even more tedious than ever and even after break after break after break I could not find the game as enjoyable as it once was.As for the goals I had at the beginning as I progressed they seemed more and more unrealistic at the start of the game I thought obtaining these goals wouldn't be that difficult that I could obtain then in just a few hundred hours but I was wrong. These goals seem unobtainable and ridiculous that I feel that there is no point in trying anymore as I'll never get that good and that makes me think that the game is redundant that no matter how hard I try I will not be able to achieve the goals I once had.,Rocket League®

2016-04-24,0,0,969,False,Recommended,"I am finally able to give this game a good review since a few updates happened. The game mechanics work without any flaws now gaining a higher rank is now taking quicker than before. Basically you don't get bashed for one or two loss playing with randoms like it was before. When you win against higher ranks it seems to grant you earlier access to a higher division than it was before. So it is more rewarding. They implemented a diverse item and trading system. It works like a charm like it did in Team Fortress 2. An ingame market economy with common values for various items has already been established by the community. I will give this game half a year and it will become like team fortress 2 in it's prime days. Except you can only trade in the lobby menu not while playing. So no one standing afk and asking for trades. So far you can only trade within the game itself and see your inventory there. It would have been better to implement the items with Steam Inventory so you could check the items from outside the game and trade them for other game's items. But maybe this will be implemented later.After all the time now i see now other way but to come back every day and play it for a few rounds. The only damn thing left in this game is the f*King toxic and very very salty community. Best thing is to avoid ""Solo Standart"" at all and only play with your friends in a team. Sadly the developers can't patch the community. But people getting banned for foul play trolling or swearing in chat would be a big step forward. Why not do so Psyonix?UPDATE 09th July 2018 By now there is a Ban System that seems to work good. You can report players and receive feedback for when your reports would help to ban someone. Psyonix seems to listen to it's community at least. Thank You Psyonix.",Rocket League®

2018-07-09,0,0,2,False,Not Recommended,"Pros Pretty graphics Tricky gameplay Simple soccer game driven by rocket propelled vehicles (which increases the fun factor of the whole game) Different abilities already given in the game can actually prove to invite more impressive stunts just to hit the ball. OK audio. Additional unlocks from completed matches gives you opportunities to make some rather humourous designs on your vehicle.Cons Extremely irritating and useless AI especially when they're on your team. Their difficulty level does not change the AI's utter stupidity. The AI makes it pretty bad to hone any of your skills and only harbours more frustration than learning anything period. (Enemy AI seems to always be a lot smarter than your allied AI and scores more goals than your allied AI does.) Very poor matchmaking. You're a ""Rookie"" pitted against and with ""Pros"". This doesn't make any ing sense. Annoying music. No option to turn that off in the main menu. Overall lack of balance between different skill levels that make this game a total bore and (very often) irritating experience.I don't recommend this piece of garbage. Lack of intuition with overall gameplay and experience game design is absolutely ed and makes it a very unplayable experience for me. It will offer a slightly steeper learning curve for some but that doesn't mean a higher learning curve makes a bad game it's the game's overall design that is made to with you countless times for no specific reason other than to constantly and consistently you off that makes it a bad game.",Rocket League®

May get boring after a while Lack of clothing (yes I am VERY serious) No Single Player DLCOverall the Single Player is really fun to play. You will get to play as three amazing characters with each having a different personality. It'll take you about 40 hours to complete the main mission (which is around 60% of the game). I personaly found the side missions a little boring so I didn't complete them all yet.GTA Online + The same map you get with SP+ Even more customizations+ SO MUCH CLOTHING!+ Really fun missions+ Free DLCs HACKERS (although they do get banned right after reporting them) The map isn't as alive as it is in SP Micro transactions EVERYTHING IS SO EXPENSIVE! Asshlole players Loading screens that take foreverGTA Online is the main reason I bought this game and it definitely met my expectations. It's a really fun game to play with a varitey of content.

2018-06-26,0,0,43,False,Recommended,"I bought this game a few days ago and got instantly hooked. I admit I have played this game before at my friends house but not so much to the point I would go out of my way and buy the game myself. I currently at the time of writing this review have 30+ hours on the game. At the start and average player might think this game is really easy and its just a casual game but when you hop into a competetive match and see all the ""good"" players your jaw will drop in the amount of possibilities that you can execute while in a game. There is sooooo much stuff you can master learn and do in this game. This game is one of the very few games that actually make me want to get better and better and better since I don't think there is a point in this game where you master everything and stop playing because the game is to easy. I must also praise Psyonix for putting out such cheap DLC's for the players. It's so cheap to have your car to look cool and the best thing is that you dont even need to pay you can just play and get LOADS of items from leveling up. There are also limited time offers where per match you for example get 14 shells and a decryptor (which is used to open crates) is 150 it seems like a lot but its far from a lot so its literally like getting a free key except you can't trade the item you unboxed. There is a lot more pro's in this game that I would point out but I dont think anyone has so much time to read everything.

Needless to say this error on the devs behalf needs to be fixed before more stunningly georgous centered balls go unscored.Great Game 10/9.76",Rocket League®

Psyonix is aware of the problem but has yet to come up with a solution.If you're just buying it for the local multiplayer and have friends who are into it worth a buy. If you expect to be able to play it online without having to spend 20 30 minutes queuing joining quitting and requeuing to try to find a real game you will be sorely disappointed by this game.,Rocket League®

2017-11-23,0,0,214,False,Recommended,Do you like Cars? Do you wanna play Soccer without actually going outside? Do mind microtransactions? (No but I do want a mystery decal!) (Too Bad..) Well then Rocket League is a game that needs to be in your library. With different mini games it keeps you entertained while there are events that get you some cool items every so often. Try to climb the rankings in competitive games or just play casual with your friends. (Just make sure not to get scored on when you're the goalie of the team expect to get yelled at...) Customize your car with awesome looking items....exept here comes the negative side of the review. You can customize your car but if you want good looking items you have to get them in crates which cost real life money. To top that off even if you do buy crates you have a really low chance of getting a mystery decal. (Best looking decals.) But remember it only changes the look of your car so unless you're a dedicated player don't bother with the crates. So besides the microtransaction part this is a really good game and I highly recommend it. It's just an all out fun thing to play I give it a 7/10.,Rocket League®

2015-12-01,0,0,684,False,Recommended,This game does everything right The DLC is only cosmetic it has consistant updates split screen multiplayer replay saving ranked servers everything you would want in this type of game is there and it all works great.It runs extremely smoothly (as it should considering how little is on screen) and looks very nice. The tessellation on the grass is an awesome touch. Rocket League is fun whether you just started playing it or if you've been playing for months. You can score goals and make saves even if you just started out but you end up slowly learning the layers of strategy as you keep playing. The longer you play it the more you learn how the ball tends to move and how to keep it on the opponent's side of the field and the game only becomes more and more fun.,Rocket League®

Nice touch with some of the different arenas and boost options although I would of liked it more if you could customize your car more. Reasonabley laid out easy enough to understand. If you want to master it you'll have to play a lot to grow familar with the physics of the game.Overall it's fun and easy enough to waste 20 minutes playing. Is it worth $20 USD? Definitely not!

2017-10-03,0,0,320,False,Recommended,Product received for free. Although this is a wonderful game it has issues all to common on team based games. Try hards individuals who shouldn't be in the public domain rage gamers and the occasional slacker looking for carry. Overall however the game itself is great I'm sure their are people who cheat and aside from the troll/nazi I've come across (multiple times over about a week) the community is relatively decent. It would help if their were ways to report cheating through replay review as well as having an innapropriate behaviour report option but that is not really a huge priority. As well it seems the servers try to adjust for low ping player which just screws up the game play I may be wrong its just my impression (I have had my car thrown around/out map while having a 60 ping but another who was playing well was at 240+). As a whole I would recomend this game without hesitation. My only issue is game stability but that could be and issue of other players(cheaters possible high ping adjuster) or my internet (centurylink through phonelines).graphics gameplay stability community(upkeep) /vfun Good meh/ averagev Needs work,Rocket League®

2017-07-28,0,0,490,False,Recommended,It think this game has potential. Great physics nice and colourful which makes me clap sometimes. I must say though it's not much of a challenge. Most of the tracks are the same shape so easy to learn the course. This could be a fab little racer but this ball thing keeps getting in the way what's up with that? Also seems most of the other players just zig zag across the track. I do perfect laps and have gotten quite fast although the chat I get from other players is a bit toxic suggesting I 'stop being a and hit the ball'.But there we go. Some of us are born racers others like to win by cutting corners.Overall a good racer not as good as Gran Turismo due to lack of variety in tracks but the cars make nice noises and sometimes go boom.,Rocket League®

There are so many bots at times I find myself striving to see how fast I can hit the report button before the other team scores on our non moving third player. The concept of the game was fun but now I think people have moved on for the most part but the company might be trying to keep the hype. And seriously they still charge players to open crates earned throughout the game. I've got them all stored up. I ain't paying for that. I always thought when you pay for a game you get a majority of the features. This one just seems to milk until it's dry.,Rocket League®

2016-08-07,0,0,165,False,Not Recommended,"It's a fun game at the core and there's a lot of things I like about it.However the most recent matchmaking update made me never want to play again and here's why Rocket League is most fun when playing with friends. Unfortunately an extremely small subset of players were having their friends tank their own MMR and then boost it back up in an effort to cheat the ranking system.This is bad but what's worse is what the decs did about it To stop this extremely small group of rank exploiters they made it so team MMR is based solely on the highest party members MMR (versus averaging the teams MMR)This means if you queue with a friend who isn't *exactly* as good as you are one of you is being put at a big disadvantage.I used to play a few days a week with 2 friends one of whom is better than me and the other one a little worse. It was always fun win or lose with many close games.Now? Every opponent is as good as the better of my two teammates which means we are ALWAYS the worse ranked team going into a match and in a surprise to no one now lose about 90% of our games and it's usually not close (why would it be when the matchmaking system purposefully found a team way better than us to play against?)All of this is exasperated by the fact that this game given it's cross platform amtchmaking has SO MANY PLAYERS and a higher player base should make ""tighter"" matchmaking easier.I honestly have no desire to log in knowing the only way to find a balanced game is to tell my friends to go kick rocks.And to think all of these changes just to stop a teeny tiny minority of people abusing the ranked system. Which had no discernable negative effect on 99% of the playerbase.",Rocket League®

When submitting a support ticket regarding significant latency rubber banding and disconnection issues Psyonix would rather blame your ISP or your own ignorance than admit their own servers are trash (despite their own CEO admitting that himself).Psyonix servers are run down overloaded latent and frustrating to play on if you're even remotely decent. If you don't have a beeline connection to the nearest server center don't bother playing.It's a fun game when it works. Otherwise it's trash.,Rocket League®

Overall this game might not have tons of depth but the skill ceiling is extremely high and it's great to see a splitscreen PC game come out in 2015.

2016-09-10,0,0,135,False,Not Recommended,The game was fun at the beginning where Psyonix actually cared more about making a fun game than making money. Now the game is a complete mess you can't play every map in custom game (meaning you can't do certain game modes against your friends) some of the new maps seems to be only mades to be visually attractives and worst of the worst now the items drop is low items are ranked by rarity and you have to pay at least 1 for 1 Key and a chance to drop another item that would have usually been in a DLC or a free update. In the meantime servers are still unstables matchmaking is full of bugs and strange choices are mades (like WTF you can hide your rank on an online game ?).Anyway. Thanks Psyonix for turning from an independant dev who's happy to sell his game to a company who try to make us pay more and more.,Rocket League®

2018-07-05,0,0,633,False,Not Recommended,I have to give it a thumbs up because it is a very fun game. Its very addicting. More than you would think. Ive logged over 500 hours in and feel that im decent for my rank. That being said i give it a 3 out of 5. It has some of the worst matchmaking ive ever had the displeasure of using. Unless you have talented friends to play with you all the time you are in for a lot of losing that will mostly not be your fault. The game constantly matches you up with people that are less than your rank and mostly less than your skill and for some reason thinks you wanna play teams of people who are even better and higher rank than you are. You will get angry ALOT! On top of that they love to put you in matches with ai bots on your team and im telling you right now youll rather have a rookie on your team then the best ai bot they have. Some of the worst ai programming ive seen in a game. Youll also quite often get put into a match that you have no chance of winning. Youll be bumped into a match that has 1 or 2 minutes remaining and be down 5+ to nothing. You have no choice. There is no option to opt out of games already in progress (atleast not that ive found). It is the most frustrating and yet incredibly addicting games ive ever played. Youll have fun but be prepared for alot of stress!!!EDIT!!!! I can no longer give this game a good review. I attempted to do the 3v3 anniversary and it booted me out because it couldnt load a module. I then got a message saying that you now get punished for leaving games and that the punishment will get worse the more you do it. It made me wait 5 minutes to play another match. You absolutely cannot punish people for leaving games and not fix your broken matchmaking. Thats completely assanign!!!!!,Rocket League®

So basically it's the same experience when playing other Ball Games against or with my friends.We yell we shout we try to make the world greatest plays and moves to impress and stomp each others... AND IT FEELS GREAT!!!!!!!This game is as simple as addicting!RC ish like cars with a good load of customisable appearences great music very smooth and nice graphics for a fair price.Oh and not to mention you can crash and destroy your openents with boosted speed to get a small adventage.If you kept reading until this you'll be wondering ''No cons at all? There have to be some issues or bad things about this game''Jeah there were some hicups when they game released with server stability/lag issues but it's resolved and no point to even mention it now again. Everything runs smooth there are no bugs at all that I could face like e.g. stuck in a wall or something else. The only thing you might feel very often is that your openent(s) has/have more luck than you in the ways the ball gets hit BUT it's a great motivation to become even better in this game and spend even more time playing it! And on the other hand with its short time per match (5 minutes when the ball gets hit/ 6 8 per match due to goal replays... and there can be many goal replays!) it is perfect to play it just for ''in between'' or if you need a short break from something.See ya in the stadion!,Rocket League®

2016-07-31,0,0,63,False,Recommended,Good evening.How great it is to be with you tonight.Let me begin by thanking the hundreds of thousands of Americans who actively participated in our campaign as volunteers. Let me thank the 2 1/2 million Americans who helped fund our campaign with an unprecedented 8 million individual campaign contributions averaging $27 a piece. Let me thank the 13 million Americans who voted for the political revolution giving us the 1 846 pledged delegates here tonight 46 percent of the total. And delegates Thank you for being here and for all the work you ve done. I look forward to your votes during the roll call on Tuesday night.And let me offer a special thanks to the people of my own state of Vermont who have sustained me and supported me as a mayor congressman senator and presidential candidate. And to my family my wife Jane four kids and seven grandchildren thank you very much for your love and hard work on this campaign.I understand that many people here in this convention hall and around the country are disappointed about the final results of the nominating process. I think it s fair to say that no one is more disappointed than I am. But to all of our supporters here and around the country I hope you take enormous pride in the historical accomplishments we have achieved.Together my friends we have begun a political revolution to transform America and that revolution Our Revolution continues. Election days come and go. But the struggle of the people to create a government which represents all of us and not just the 1 percent a government based on the principles of economic social racial and environmental justice that struggle continues. And I look forward to being part of that struggle with you.Let me be as clear as I can be. This election is not about and has never been about Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump or Bernie Sanders or any of the other candidates who sought the presidency. This election is not about political gossip. It s not about polls. It s not about campaign strategy. It s not about fundraising. It s not about all the things the media spends so much time discussing.This election is about and must be about the needs of the American people and the kind of future we create for our children and grandchildren.This election is about ending the 40 year decline of our middle class the reality that 47 million men women and children live in poverty. It is about understanding that if we do not transform our economy our younger generation will likely have a lower standard of living then their parents.This election is about ending the grotesque level of income and wealth inequality that we currently experience the worst it has been since 1928. It is not moral not acceptable and not sustainable that the top one tenth of one percent now own almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent or that the top 1 percent in recent years has earned 85 percent of all new income. That is unacceptable. That must change.This election is about remembering where we were 7 1/2 years ago when President Obama came into office after eight years of Republican trickle down economics.The Republicans want us to forget that as a result of the greed recklessness and illegal behavior on Wall Street our economy was in the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression. Some 800 000 people a month were losing their jobs. We were running up a record breaking deficit of $1.4 trillion and the world s financial system was on the verge of collapse.We have come a long way in the last 7 1/2 years and I thank President Obama and Vice President Biden for their leadership in pulling us out of that terrible recession.Yes we have made progress but I think we can all agree that much much more needs to be done.This election is about which candidate understands the real problems facing this country and has offered real solutions not just bombast fear mongering name calling and divisiveness.We need leadership in this country which will improve the lives of working families the children the elderly the sick and the poor. We need leadership which brings our people together and makes us stronger not leadership which insults Latinos Muslims women African Americans and veterans and divides us up.By these measures any objective observer will conclude that based on her ideas and her leadership Hillary Clinton must become the next president of the United States. The choice is not even close.This election is about a single mom I saw in Nevada who with tears in her eyes told me that she was scared to death about the future because she and her young daughter were not making it on the $10.45 an hour she was earning. This election is about that woman and the millions of other workers in this country who are struggling to survive on totally inadequate wages.Hillary Clinton understands that if someone in America works 40 hours a week that person should not be living in poverty. She understands that we must raise the minimum wage to a living wage. And she is determined to create millions of new jobs by rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure our roads bridges water systems and wastewater plants.But her opponent Donald Trump well he has a very different view. He does not support raising the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour a starvation wage. While Donald Trump believes in huge tax breaks for billionaires he believes that states should actually have the right to lower the minimum wage below $7.25. What an outrage!This election is about overturning Citizens United one of the worst Supreme Court decisions in the history of our country. That decision allows the wealthiest people in America like the billionaire Koch brothers to spend hundreds of millions of dollars buying elections and in the process undermine American democracy.Hillary Clinton will nominate justices to the Supreme Court who are prepared to overturn Citizens United and end the movement toward oligarchy in this country. Her Supreme Court appointments will also defend a woman s right to choose workers rights the rights of the LGBT community the needs of minorities and immigrants and the government s ability to protect the environment.If you don t believe this election is important if you think you can sit it out take a moment to think about the Supreme Court justices that Donald Trump would nominate and what that would mean to civil liberties equal rights and the future of our country.This election is about the thousands of young people I have met who have left college deeply in debt and the many others who cannot afford to go to college. During the primary campaign Secretary Clinton and I both focused on this issue but with different approaches. Recently however we have come together on a proposal that will revolutionize higher education in America. It will guarantee that the children of any family this country with an annual income of $125 000 a year or less 83 percent of our population will be able to go to a public college or university tuition free. That proposal also substantially reduces student debt.This election is about climate change the greatest environmental crisis facing our planet and the need to leave this world in a way that is healthy and habitable for our kids and future generations. Hillary Clinton is listening to the scientists who tell us that unless we act boldly and transform our energy system in the very near future there will be more drought more floods more acidification of the oceans more rising sea levels. She understands that when we do that we can create hundreds of thousands of good paying jobs.,Rocket League®

2016-04-07,0,0,730,False,Not Recommended,I have trouble running this game with SLI enabled Win 7 i7 3770k z77 2 GTX 680's. Framerate periodically drops to sub 20fps. Everytime I exit the game and re launch it my settings are reverted to defaults. This means having to select my car paint my car select all of my goodies for my car set my camera settings my controller bindings change server settings and change my graphics setttings... EACH... AND... EVERYTIME that I play. So ANNOYING. I used to be able to just pop in and pop out for a quick 5 minute match but now I have to spend 5 minutes just getting my settings back to where I need them. Because of this bug that they refuse to patch or even acknowledge exists I can no longer recommend this game to anyone. Fix your game. Players are often mean to each other and are often to vulgar for me. You can mute them and even report them but that means stopping in the middle of an active game to access the player menus and selecting these options. AI bots will totally throw a winning game away for your team. They are constantly scoring own goals getting in the way making poor decisions and driving in the opposite direction of where they should be. They are even worse on the experimental rocketlabs mutator and snowday tracks. The better you are at this game the worse the bots are. Unless you want to play a highly competitive ranked match where players will yell profanity at you then you willl most certainly be playing with some of these awful bots from time to time.,Rocket League®

But I continued to practice and practice until I got better. This game is highly rewarding for the work you put in. I believe that Rocket League is a top tier game as they don t throw new versions of the game to make money. Psyonix has really put in lots of work to update and fix any bug in the game and the community is almost always willing to help a new player out. I m currently Platinum 2 Div 2. Rocket League has truly satisfied me and I plan on playing for some years to come.,Rocket League®
2017-03-23,0,0,1167,False,Not Recommended,"The problem with rocket league is not necessarily the loot boxes (you can keep the them and trade them for items) but the way they are actively encouraging account hacking. They clearly stated that they did not made their items ""steam items"" so you are not protected by steam guard there is no double authentication they NEVER took any actions against any phishing site if your account is hacked there is no way to secure it again and they always back the hackers by stating that they will never returned the stolen items and in order to even submit a ticket to them you NEED to use the good old very secure INTERNET EXPLORER . At the end of the day you can have a good time in this game if you never get any tradable items (if you feel like just buy a DLC) never get to emotional doring gameplay because they never punished trolls but you will get a ban for bad words meant for troll kids you always treat it as a joke and nothing more ignore constant rank reset and decrease the number of ranksDue to support for hackers and thiefs I can't recommand this game regardless of anything else.p.s. the developers are jus some racist garbages so if you are from certain countries you are not allowed to respond to insults and your reports will never be answered .",Rocket League®

This game is the most fun when playing with a friend talking to him/her through Voicechat. Pros + Big possibilities for tactical gameplay.+ No limitations in tactics due to the very little amount of game mechanics (the team with the most goals wins)+ The feeling when you score after a nice passing play is worth all the practice.+ Very good update support from dev that tries to take community issues into consideration.,Rocket League®

I've never had more fun driving a car. The sheer chaos and the occasional awesome save or goal just makes it even more fun. Granted as any other multiplayer game it's more fun to play with others. But that shouldn't keep you from getting this gem. Many will say that you require a controller for this. Maybe for some of the more complicated moves but with decent keybindings you can play it well on a keyboard as well. Yes you heard that right. This game has rebindable keys. A rarity even among AAA titles these days.Soundtrack is just perfect. It really fits the setting.Would I suggest you buy it? Well did you read my review? No? Then yes! I fully suggest it.

The momentum of the ball is in effect extremely predictable which equates to a game that is all about coordination teamwork and positioning NOT so much about individual player skill like so many players preach.,Rocket League®

This game is fun. Moving around is fun. Flying through the air is fun. Trying and usually failing to hit the ball is fun (remember trash tier).You know what isn't fun? Matchmaking.In 90% of my casual games and so far all of my ranked ones there is a player on one of the teams who is vastly superior to all of the other players. Sometimes my team sometimes the other team but it is always that one guy playing around with the rest of us. Personally I see enough I like in this game and know it is for me so I know I will enjoy.

2018-02-02,0,0,276,False,Recommended,"Great game awful reward system. Okay so the game is really fun. Scoring in Rocket League actually feels incredibly rewarding the gameplay is smooth feels very well optimised and the graphics imo are actually really vibrant and very good. Problem I have with this game is the awful reward system. Somewhere along the line of levelling up I ""earned"" a rare crate which at the time I thought was great and looked forward to opening it. That was until I saw the 2 words ""Potential Items"" then ""Unlock with key"". So in other words loot crates that you ""earn"" have to be paid for. You do earn items such as cars decals and many other customisable things along the way but none of them feel unique and worth showing off like the possible items you could get from reward crates but oh yeah... you have to pay for them. I was stupid enough to and got an awful single decal for a car I wasn't even using. Advice Get the game don't buy the loot crates.",Rocket League®
2018-03-30,0,0,267,False,Not Recommended,The gameplay is fun and the feel is very good. My main issue with this game is the servers myself as well as multiple other people i have spoken to routinely experince rather bad server lag when people leave or join a game as well as when someone gets demo'd as well as at seeming random points during the game when the ball or other players will seemingly phase through each other or teleport. There will also be situations where on your end you have hit the ball or someone else hits it however the server either does not register it or registers something else and so the ball will begin to move one direction only to teleport the other way. If the server issues were not present i would say this game is effectivley perfect however for a game about precise mechanics and timing the server lag is incredibly jarring and can be at times aggravating. Other then that the game is fine.,Rocket League®

2017-11-22,0,0,2,False,Recommended,Oh yes. This game is... THE MOST LEGENDARY GAME FROM MY CHILDHOOD! I reme ber playing worms 3 mayhen when i was like 8 years old. And this game is basically the same just better. Let me point out a few reasons why you should immediateli put all of your money into this game The gameplay Turn based 3D gameplay. While it's most fun when played with a controller it'll be almost as fun with your keyboard and mousa. It's also so much fun with local multiplayer since A) There's usually no one at the online multiplayer and B) You can't smash online opponents with a controller. Also the story mode is a ton of fun. You get the full story mode of worms 4 mayhem and worms 3d! Alsom you'll be fine with a single controller since you just give to the person who has the turn.The music OHMYGOSHYES!!!!! The soundtrack is just amazing. I want to describe it with the word Masterpiece. I downloaded almost the full soundtrack because the music is just so awesome. It's very calm but fits the game for some reason.Also you can create your own teams (with thats and stuff) weapons and gamemodes I absolutely and warmly recommend this game. Now go ahead and buy it.Thonking2Pepe3kms2,Rocket League®

It's been attenmpted in real life but since you can't change the fundamental physics of the real world it wasn't very fun. Psyonix hit the nail right on the head with this. Looks beautiful plays smooth and I get to drive the Batmobile. My only gripe is the lack of punishment for ragequitters in casual. You can leave at any time with absolutely no penalty. It doesn't even count as a loss. I know a guy with a 99% win rate because he left every game he was gonna lose. Other than that its an amazing game with a great and wholesome fanbase (mostly everyone I play with is so nice) and exhilarating gameplay. 9.3/10,Rocket League®

2017-03-08,0,0,463,False,Recommended,Rocket League seems simple use a car to push or hit a ball into a goal. It is rather easy to jump into and learn the controls and mechanics. But just like real soccer (or any sport for that matter) mastering dribbling passing and goaltending takes time. One game played can turn into two two into four and before you know it you've played two hours worth of games. It's a game that easy you can put 1000 hours into and not be bored of it. One piece of advice having a controller helps you can get good with a mouse and keyboard but a controller makes movement easier from my experience.10/10 worth every penny a must play for pretty much anyone.,Rocket League®

2017-12-22,0,0,790,False,Recommended,"Great game. However there is a large percentage of this community that really makes you want to jump off a cliff. Ranking system recently is very broken. A lot of players are ranked at platinum this season yet they cannot even hit the ball or their skill is equivalent to a beginner bot. My advice is if you want to have fun play with someone you trust or you will never progress in rank. Crates are a money pit. With no resale value you are better off buying keys waiting 7 days and finding items on a trading site that you actually want. Trading can be fun yet there is only a small part of the community that will fairly trade with you which is even more reason not to bother opening crates. The DLC is mostly worthless considering the ""best"" cars come with the game and in the crates.",Rocket League®

2017-11-24,0,0,913,False,Not Recommended,Over 700 hours been the most amazing game to hold my interest for that long. The developers are awesome and keep providing new content or so I thought. Their implitimentation of an auto ban system is completely ridiculous and has disallowed players to fully communicate. I mean even comedically amongst your teammate not insulting other players. I now change my glowing review to a negative as I have been randomly getting banned and will proceed to uninstall and join those on the forums that advocate the demise of the RL population. It was a good run but way to ruin the game so that you do not offend young children Psyonix. Numerous solutions could have approached this issue better than your asinine list of auto ban words.,Rocket League®

Decent servers across the world Many offline options to play as well as online Many game modes DLC and other paid in game content is ONLY cosmetics no pay to win Updates are still coming nearly 2 years after initial release Pretty good sound trackCONS The game thinks &gt 250 ms delay for ping is acceptable The skill/rank matchmaking algorithms aren't always good No ability to kick bots No cut off angle for the camera (so if you're locked onto the ball and it goes above you you'll lose sight of everything but the ball!) I feel like there aren't enough unlockable skins for the default cars. Like just one or two more per car would be plenty. No option for playing music while in a match...?TLDR If you don't think the concept of playing soccer in remote control cars with rocket boosters and explosive jumping capabilities with equipable hats is interesting then don't buy this game.

2017-08-24,0,0,264,False,Not Recommended,I really used to love this game. Like I LOVED this game. So much that I paid full price for xbox version then later full price for PC version when I upgraded to a new pc. But the servers. First let me say I have fiber. I get 150mbps with very little latency at least. This is when my two roommates are actively gaming also. Yet I work a night schedule and can play in the middle of the night on a worknight when I am pushing 200mbps and there is STILL lag.This is a very popular game now. The internet is riddled with people asking how to FIX this. But because the game is so popular it just gets swept under the rug. A few months ago I would have recommended this game to ANYONE. In my 50 or so games in my Steam library this is the only one that CONSISTENTLY lags for me. I have scoured the internet trying to find a solution but frankly I am just tired of it. I am about to stop playing this game entirely when I lose multiple games in a row due to lag and then when I mentioned it I just get bullied and talked by the other gamers. I can deal with the occasional lag and even crash. But this is every game every time I log on. It has finally gotten old. I will quit this game if I don't see improvement. And I really don't want to.,Rocket League®

Please come back home and start racing professionally when you're older!"" Speed Ra Mifune's dad shouts.""Okay dad!

2018-04-25,0,0,226,False,Recommended,Honestly with close to 150 hours in this game I really can recommend it. The game is simply fun. At first it's really hard but what I found was that the difficulty kept relevant to my skill level (most of the time) But what annoys me the most about it is deffinately the matchmaking I am now around level 33 and consider myself pretty good but I am ALWAYS Placed in matches with either AI or Rookies against parties of Masters. I have made a little experiment every single game that I was placed completely unfairly I screenshotted. And in the last 200 or so games 106 have been terribly matchmaked.Overall I think that this game is great but the matchmaking could do with a fair bit of tweaking or maybe I'm just too good _(ツ)_/,Rocket League®

2016-02-07,0,0,127,False,Not Recommended,Firstly I love this game because you can drive all over Europe. You have to manage your money and make sure that when you get out a loan from the bank you have enough money to pay it back or are at least making enough daily profit to pay it back.You also manage a business. You can hire drivers to work for you and they will complete jobs for you but you have to pay them a wage plus some for every journey they complete. You level up they skills that make them be better at certian things like you can make them earn more money for going over a set distance or you can make them carry high value or fragile cargo. They can also carry ADR materials so things that could be dangourous. But you get paid more for that.You can always do 'Quick Jobs' and these are when the employer provides the truck and you just go where they tell you. This is fun but it starts to get boring only doing short deliverys so you can buy a truck so that you can go further distances and get more money.To conclude I feel that anybody who likes games like Farm Simulator or any simulator game should give this game a try because it is a great way to unwind after a long day and I have found it to be so much fun and very calming. Some people say that this is a boring game I happen to disagree.,Rocket League®

2016-01-14,0,0,13,False,Recommended,The game is alot of fun. Good variety of cars wheels tops maps etc.And with updates coming quite often it's worth the $15 or I believe $12 on sale.I only have one complaint about this game. Why doesn't the customization do anything? (i.e) You would think that if I have tires that are bigger I would have less mobility but more power when I hit the ball. Or if I have a smaller car I can go faster than a bigger car. But no it doesn't do anything. Easy to pick up hard to master and gameplay isn't what you would expect but that's ok if you use a controller.,Rocket League®

2016-11-28,0,0,1002,False,Recommended,On the surface it seems Rocket League is a glorified soccer game with a Y axis added to the field of play. But it's so much more. It takes time to learn the mechanics and then teach your fingers to actually do that crazy aerial you are trying. There's an ever rising ceiling of skill level for those who just want more but there's also casual play for people like me who just want to sit down for an hour and play a handful of games stress free.If you're worried you won't like Rocket League because it seems like another sports game I assure you it's vastly different. At the end of the day the aim of the game is to score goals and win but playing this game is so much more fun than simply trying to win. You can attempt new moves assist teammates or perfect crazy goaltending techniques. You don't have to be the star of every game or even any game. You can be a team player and help your teammates to victory without even scoring a goal. While no community is without toxic players most of the players I've come across are very friendly. In what other online game would you find an opponent complimenting the other team on their skills? That's what makes this game unique. The game is as fun now as it was when I picked it up months ago so do yourself a favor find some friends with the game or who are interested and play together that's the best way to experience the magic of Rocket League.,Rocket League®

2018-11-25,0,0,486,False,Not Recommended,Great game but it isn't enjoyable when Psyonix can't prioritize server performance/cross platform after annoucning specific dates that they would. I don't trust multi million $ companies who say something and don't fulfill. If you understand business you will understand that there are REASONS why certain games do better than others. (EPIC). They prioritize the community not MONEY #corportateamericaThey made cross platform they're #1 priority for a reason.... and now look at the games/companies success.All this tells me is that other companies (such as Psyonix) must not care enough to be GREAT. Otherwise you would prioritize the things that SHOULD be done. I have been following Psyonix updates since 2017 of them annoucning cross platform updates and all they have done is push it back ANOTHER year. REALLY THINK ABOUT THIS BEFORE PURCHASING.,Rocket League®

2016-08-25,0,0,930,False,Recommended,Reading the negative reviews made me realize how many people do not get how matchmaking in Rocket League specifically the ranked matches works. The levels of Rookie Pro Master ect. mean as much as being 10th prestige in call of duty. Absolutely nothing other than relatively how much time you have put into a game. Matchmaking is figured by a skill rating (a hidden MMR) not with how many points you have scored. Theoretically you could reach the rank of Rocketeer without ever winning a game in your career. Also the people say the community sucks have somewhat of a point but mostly just because they dont win enough. People don't talk if you beat them.,Rocket League®

Rocket League By Psyonix is an amazing game and has alot of great mechanics developers and physics. The pure base of the game is a great idea. With so much to do the possibilities are almost endless! With over 10 billion car combinations (as of launch in 2015) and many more constantly coming in the fully adjstable camera angles and all those sweet sweet moves!The trading community is HUGE in rocket league with many nice people (just be careful.) trade your way up to get those Siiiick! items.

2018-07-20,0,0,797,False,Recommended,Fun party game to play with friends. Community isn't half bad almost all toxic players are at lower ranks. Good solid mechanics with very few a little bugs you come across. The bad server every once in a while. Mostly balanced matchmaking. Great car customization to let you decide how you want your car to look like. The tournaments are a fun way to compete with others but still need some work. The DLC is a very good option for variety and change of your game play. The crate system is similar to CS GO's (get a crate buy key to open). There is cross play with Xbox AND Playstation but Xbox and Playstation players can't be in the same game unless you are in a private match. Ranking system is pretty good minor hiccups every update and will still improve in the future. good game,Rocket League®

2016-12-07,0,0,631,False,Not Recommended,im convinced that there is one dev working on this game and he just shows up to work once or twice a month in his pijamas. There is fps connection lag everytime you enter a game or someone joins constantly trash servers that give you blinking dialog icons while playing that they never fix i mean come on It took them 3 YEARS to fade music into and from menus. in non ranked it constantly puts you in games that are either finished or have nothing but bots. if you leave a non ranked game and que again it will put you right back into the same one... and theres no way of knowing what game im joining because they took the server names away from dialog box so we cant avoid those games. Still cant turn off certain trash songs from main menu. ranked is still cancer where u win 2 consecutive games to get MR and you lose 1 and you go all the way back down to where u were before 2 wins. Honestly this game hasnt improved at all since its release in 2015,Rocket League®

2015-11-05,0,0,10,False,Recommended,Rocket League is an extremely fun game. Car soccer/football is fun and the graphics of the game are awesome. The only issue I have is server related. I live in a small town in Florida which doesn't get good internet access and servers are far away and tend to make online playing a pain as playing with 100+ ping is hard.

2015-12-06,0,0,1066,False,Recommended,9.5/10+ Great optimization clean UI lots of car customization excellent post launch support. The best way to describe this game is to say it's pure and addictive fun. It's the prime example of a game that is easy to pick up but hard to master. I tend to play multiplayer games with my close group of friends and hate playing most solo this game is good enough to be one of the only exceptions to that habit. With no penalty for quitting unranked matches some one sided affairs can turn in to a revolving door of players coming and leaving. As with any game that has attained mass appeal it has its fair share of toxic players.,Rocket League®

2018-02-16,0,0,382,False,Recommended,A friend of mine summed up Rocket League pretty well Easy to learn hard to master.Other than that what is there really to dissect? Two teams against each other you can go from 1v1 to 4v4. If you want some variation there's basketball hockey dropshot and rumble. Rounds take 5 minutes so this is a really great game to drop into really fast and then drop out. I've turned off the music in the game and then I put on some good old Judas Priest Yngwie Malmsteen and play for the duration of an album or so. Incredibly fun with friends and it also supports LAN.One of the most toxic communities I've experienced outside of Call of Duty. For newcomers Play with a joystick if possible. Leave your rank title on. The game takes a bit of time to learn. You will miss the ball a bunch of times but when you nail it it feels good. When you start scoring goals learning to fly that feels pretty good too.The game has loot boxes... and as always they ing suck. There's only two ways to get items in the game. Buy keys for crates. Or trade in 5 pieces of loot to some random crap. I've bought 5 keys once and never will again. As with all loot boxes you get So if there is a specific item you want for your cars (some cars only drop in crates as well...) then you're out luck. Go to a 3rd party site to trade or try your luck on the Steam forum.Linux port is not really up to snuff. AA does not work at all. There is a bug if you use keyboard/mouse where if you press left and right mouse (boost and jump) at the same time it looks backwards. So if you want to jump fast and boost then sometimes you're out of luck. Besides that performance is pretty good.,Rocket League®

2017-07-09,0,0,1897,False,Not Recommended,"a new season starts so it s a lot of crate hunters back again. People join games via script but don t play. leaving you 1v3 or 2v3 in every 3rd or 4th game atm.also a lot of salty people back making it hard to finish just one simple match. They rather threaten to find you kill you and your family or they start scoring own goals when they are trailing by 2 after 30 seconds.game still is a good fun if you turn off any chat or just play with your friends. But some people seem to be really depressive or somewhat mentally instable when they play RL.Maybe I m just too old for this behaviour maybe this behaviour gets you more viewers on Twitch... but sometimes it can be frustrating when you just wanna play and cannot finish one single game within an hour without heavy insults unsportsmanlike conducts or just idle players that just hunt crates.Update November 27th 2017 Still the saltiness is ruining the game. With the new update that punishes quitters more people start to go idle or just drive around in 3 out of 5 matches.Update May 5th 2018 played 5 games. First one opponent is idle/macro moving. Had to sit the entire game and wait. Second game was okay. Third game one guy kept shouting "" ing retard"" through the mic. Fourth game the opponent started typing ""noob"" every 10 seconds like with an automated macro. Fifth and last game opponent typed ""idiot"" after we were in the lead 3 1 and started shooting on own goal. Didn t wanna forfeit. When we were behind 3 4 he was idle until the end of the game.Since the implementation of the report system I only report drastic insults shooting own goals and beeing idle with a macro. Although there were even 3 death threads in chat only one single protest was cared of.",Rocket League®

Since then I gave the map a thumbs down in game so I rarely see it and I have also since upgraded my PC.Rocket League has infinite replayability online.

2018-01-01,0,0,1050,False,Not Recommended,"As an avid fan of an atmosphere enthralled with competition and packed with an indefinite supply of suspense and engagement I can confirm that the Rocket League title fulfills the natural tendency of our minds to wander into a world in which competitive superiority and progressive advancement yields satisfaction and promotes collaboration. Indeed after 896 hours of gameplay I have experienced exhilarating victory the product of numerous nail biting saves howling shots and graceful aerial goals of which solidify one's sense of freedom. From the novice ranks of Prospect boasting my innocence as a new player in the world of Rocket League to the evolution of skill and advancement in competition as was highlighted by my rise to the star ranks later known as Platinum and Diamond I enjoyed pondering upon the idea that I had an everlasting potential to improve and increase my rank. Watching the champions of Rocket League engage in fierce battle characterized by benevolent sportsmanship and advertised as a competition boasting a prize of thousands in dollars I came to recognize that this was the primary objective of ambitious players across the world a dream to reach the highest admired level in ESports. Indeed the ability to improve meet aspiring players who hold goals equivalent to the ones envisioned by you and I and share a common creed of bold individuals who crave to productively seek success is fostered in companionship and strengthened by a competitive purpose. Nevertheless maybe this far fetched idea this perception of mine held throughout my time in membership was a dream in itself. While it remains true and likely will remain so that those who cherish this game as a tool of ultimate action packed entertainment and a collaborative guide in developing friendship reap a profound satisfaction in a dignity reinforced with gameplay I have witnessed a converse dismal reality portrayed with only malice and a destructive urge to conquer everything except for this outlined positivity. From the punishingly immense insults reasoning my ""weakminded sheep"" like qualities to echoing curses which only obscure and suppress the chief objective of the game to gain entertainment and attain success it remains available for one to consider the personal benefits associated with gaining victory examined with the opposing toxicity which often effectively destroys self accomplishment and tears emotional stability. This consistent presence of ominous and dreadful affairs only weakens the foundation of an otherwise blissful and unified community and for me tarnishes the hope of reaching the nurturing community offered by established players such as Kronovi. As a result without a founded motive for playing Rocket League weakened and damaged by a socially degrading player base the act of uninstalling the game justifies my desire to maintain a pure lifestyle unbounded by corruption and malevolence. While I must append that the remediation offered by Psyonix and Rocket League representatives encourages an environment free from pollution and distressing insult it is up to the user as to whether or not these solutions are sufficient to present a desire to play in the otherwise well constructed framework that composes Rocket League.",Rocket League®

With such fast and addictive gameplay compiled into short five minute matches it's a game that you'll literally be telling yourself ""just five more minutes"". The skill gap is surprisingly high for such a simple concept. Nearly every game you'll find someone doing something that you can't even comprehend how it could ever be done only to one day do it yourself and somehow still be downright astonished at the complexity of the moves you pull off. With surprising in depth customization that doesn't effect your stats the aspect of trading items can become a game in its own right.

(Fun Fact Rocket league is a sequel.)This game is Very simple but really really really really really really really really really difficult to master. But dont worry there are many videos and third party programs to help you. And if you get really good at the game you could concider playing at ESPORTS level (Its really hard).There is DLC to pay for but its great as its all cosmetic and you only need it if you want to look very stylish But you still get custom cars and stuff if u want.

2017-11-12,0,0,183,False,Recommended,"With all of the hundreds of thousands of video games out there eventually there was going to be a game that seemed to continually get everything right. That game is...Rocket LeagueThis is the game that keeps on giving. Psyonix seems to be incapable of making a wrong decision when it comes to this game. Everything is done so perfectly. Every texture model visual effect world sound clip... every last one was given extra care. It looks and feels real. Not just ""Wow look at the shaders"" real but like real real. I feel like I could jump into my monitor and drive that car. The physics of the game behave the way you expect physics to behave. Gravity works perfectly inertia feels real even lift and drag are life like. The ball reacts to your car like it should dropping onto it in midair with your wheels will be distinctly different in three ways from hitting it with the front of your car on the ground. It's so easy to explain the game Rocket League takes the basics of soccer (2 nets get a ball in the other team's net) changes the team size to 3 and replaces people with cars that have rockets. To power these rockets you have to collect boost. When a ball is 100% inside the net (no part of the ball is outside the volume of the net) it counts as a goal. That's basically the game right there and yet it's so much more complex than that. I can't tell you what to do from there because that's your playing style that adds complexity to it. Your strengths and weaknesses and the other player's strengths and weaknesses are what defines this game. The game allows you to create techniques that even the developers didn't think of the game doesn't bug out when presented with something entirely new. The updates... continue to only make the game better. Crates. In most video games crates are hated. Rocket League does it differently. For one you know exactly where your money goes RLCS (and other events) prize pools. Second you can't get a higher chance of getting an item by paying. Joe Average has the same chance of getting an Import Body out of a crate as a YouTuber does. If you don't like the item you can trade it and four others in for a better one. But it's all personal preference you may not want anything that the crates have to offer. The customization leaves you wanting more but in a good way you wish there was more stuff to customize even after customizing every little detail. Psyonix keeps adding more categories and items. Your playstyle works hand in hand with the car you chose each car is different with its strengths and weaknesses and after a while you'll find yourself mostly choosing one car. My personal car so far is the Vulcan. The DLC... you don't feel pressured into buying DLC in order to win. You get the DLC because you're having a blast with Rocket League and you want to try out those cars. I could go on and on and on. Pros10/10 game getting everything right. ConsOn lower spec computers it doesn't look all that great with all the visuals turned off but... what are you gonna do? You can only optimize a game so much without losing quality and gameplay.",Rocket League®

I've spent 1 100 hours playing it and I don't regret one of those hours as this game brought me more enjoyment until the last day than most games ever bring me. However tonight I uninstalled Rocket League. Originally I gave this game a glowing review. It was a competitive game that literally anyone could pick up and play. I could play the casual modes with kids and the competitive modes with my friends. However the matchmaking has simply become too much for me. The games aren't even close to being fair in terms of balanced teams and Psyonix has implemented no way for us to review the quality of our matches. I honestly don't mind losing games in ranked play as long as they are close. However most of my recent games were complete blowouts despite my efforts to carry my teammates.,Rocket League®

Now that I'm more than 550 hours in and currently in the top division I can definitely say that the game is worth it. It's great as a party/nooby game as its fun to pick up even when you aren't too good. And as the game is essentially entirely skill based there is a ton of room for growth and too see yourself improve.Added bonus Psyonix is awesome when it comes to communicating with the community. Also relative to other popular games and especially the higher up u get there is not very much toxicity. Not to say that there aren't people that just blame others and rage cause there are but relatively speaking there are less.If you have your doubts just watch a few ESL games or check out the following Youtube Amoney_tv Gibbs subparbutinhd kronovi paschy90 lachinio low5iveTwitch xRizzo00 Amoney_tv low5iveJust buy it!!!,Rocket League®

2016-10-28,0,0,1201,False,Not Recommended,"Be warned Rocket League is a very easy game to pick up and play for the first time. The gameplay is simple and intuitive. Anyone can jump in and have a good time. However this game is also extremely hard to master and can take hundreds and hundreds of hours to make minimal progress in terms of skill. Therefore any new players to the game might find themselves getting destroyed in online play with little to no hope of winning against more skilled opponents.That being said it is very much worth the time and effort required to learn the more advanced techniques required to be competative in this game. I for one am a person with a short attention span and find myself jumping from game to game playing 1 2 hours of this game then 2 3 hours of that game getting bored insanely fast. Rocket league is one of the only exceptions to this. I can find myself sinking 6 7 hours in one session and still wanting to play more. Well worth the price tag for fans of any genre. You simply cannot go wrong with this game if you are willing to put the time in.1000+ hours 2's and 3's ChampionTLDR There are very VERY few games I would give a 10/10. This is one of them.EDIT After some changes made to the game and the policies I can no longer recommend the game. Devs now ban people at the drop of a hat. Psyonix is anti free speech and hypocritical. They will ban you for saying things that are litterally put on banners that are thrown in peoples faces when you score a goal. The ranking system also is designed to keep you at your rank and it intentionally prevents you from ranking up. Win 3 games in a row? ""**** you"" pysonix says as they place you against people several ranks higher and with a teammate several ranks lower. But don't vent it out on your horrible teammate or you are going to get banned. Not worth your time if you are serious about games.",Rocket League®

2018-01-02,0,0,1244,False,Not Recommended,The community and Psyonix is killing an otherwise amazing game.Casuals just become a revolving door once you go down goals due to no leaver penalties which means you're playing down a person or two constantly. You could just go for ranked but sometimes you just want to relax and have some fun and the community just won't allow any of that fun to happen.Pysonix keeps adding crates and other monetizational services when more time and money should be focused one fix the absolutely horrible server quality and adding in more updates not focused on crates and this idiotic rocket pass.I also personally think that getting rid of non standard maps makes the game worse and less enjoyable while making the game even more repetitive so thanks for getting rid of all of the actual fun maps from the playlists. The game needs some kind of priority matchmaking for placing premades and premades because as a solo only player i absolutely despise playing against premades that can communicate and rotate better than me and 2 randoms. I also think there needs to be ranked restrictions for who you can queue with in ranked. Players in placements shouldn't affect the mmr of anyone that play with in ranked also unless their previous season mmr HEAVILY outweighs the rest of the group.Until the Psyonix can get their collective heads out of their asses i don't think the game is even worth the meager amount it costs. Take you money and go buy something that isn't being stuffed into a coffin by its developer.Also let's not forget the smurfs and boosters that plague higher mmrs of this game.,Rocket League®

I really recommend this game to pc or consle players like you so pick this game up it's $19.99 but it is worth it you wont regret it but keep in mind if you want to play it on high settings you are going to need a medium laptop but I have a medium high computer that can run maximum setting at 47 fps still.",Rocket League®

2018-03-25,0,0,637,False,Recommended,I just hit 420 hours in this game. So I thought I'd write something about this game.So FIRST OFF Before you buy this game!This game is one of a kind. An idea that sounds awesome to everyone. It is an awesome idea. The gameplay behind this idea is tough for new players to understand. There is a huge skill gap between new players and players who have about 200+ hours in the game and continue to practice to become better. This wouldn't be such a problem if the community that surrounds this game wasn't completely toxic. I am not saying all the players in this game are toxic but some sadly are... This game can be particularly scary for a new player they will likely get harassed in casual games a lot. Because of this I always tell new players. just play competitive as a noob you will be much better off there. Because in some cases the new player will be able to play against other new players.Unfortunatly Not all new players are told this. So they get cursed out in a casual lobby and never want to play the game again.The second issue I have with this game Is lag and ping. I run Netgears Orbi and I have no problems. My team they have bad internet all the time. This game takes up a huge amount of bandwidth. Without the propper internet speeds you will get lag and ghost hits all the time. All of this info comes straight from my friends they till me its the only reason they hate this game.Other than the issues. The game is my favorite. One of the best games to watch at an esports competition.I am addicted to the gameplay. I am loving the content. Psyonix is a very fair company. I feel they run this game the way it should be and they have built up a swell community around it.,Rocket League®

In game reporting is a joke and I have never been aware of any action taken. Ranking seems somewhat arbitrary to me and certain ranks seem harder to get out of than others despite being lower rating. removed chat options very early which is a shame as there are some nice players out there but the majority spoil the game.

This is a gamne where you have to boost jump and drive your way to victory! The design and optimisation is fantastic ad an extremely easy game with a few cons1. Thje first thing is that it can be extremely awkward to hit the ball in some situations.2. the non soccar gamemodes like ice hocky and dropshot are well mad but in my opinion really bad especially the ice hockey it just doesnt work in rocket league.3. there are toomany dlcs in the game they should implement a way to play enough time or acheive a certain rank to obtain them although vheap i still think there are too many.,Rocket League®

2015-07-07,0,0,680,False,Recommended,"This is the ""sequel"" to the awesome Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket Powered Battle Cars from the PS3 in 2008. SARPBC was the best game that came out that year (I am fully aware that GTA IV came out in 2008). I put ""sequel"" in quotes because it's largely the same game with new trimmings. However that is not an insult. It means that Psyonix know how good their game is and not to break something that's already gameplay perfection.It is hard (or impossible) to overstate how much fun this game is because you get no assistance from the computer. Everything you get in this game is earned through skill. Lucky shots exist but you'll find that the only way to perform consistently is to master control of your car and collisions with the ball.There are only minor differences between the myriad cars you see in the screenshots so everything comes down to player skill not choice of car. ""Play balance"" isn't something we have to worry about here.After over 100 hours with this title I can say they have done the original game great justice and created something that will last for many years to come.

2018-11-05,0,0,597,False,Not Recommended,It's honestly a terrible game. Like you have the unreal engine a fantastic engine so how the can the physics be so off. The programming in this game is absolute The ball cam most of the time doesn't even look at the ball. So much bad with this game. The idea is simple the execution is absolute . Gravity isn't constant in this game sometimes the ball falls normal sometimes stupidly slow. Every patch makes the game worse. You can glitch through the ball more times then you can count. You can hit a ball dead on and it goes off on the most ridiculous angles ever and then you can hit it at ridiculous angles and it goes straight. Physics is my biggest complaint of this game there just isn't any consistency. If I had a choice to have this as my only game or have smallpox I'd choose smallpox.,Rocket League®

The publishers and the Devs of this game don't care if people ruin the game for others by not playing ranked matches or attacking their own team or even blocking your own teams shots I had this guy Frand just drive around a ranked match. Didn't even pretend to play. Why join a match you aren't even playing other than just to be a jerk and ruin it for others? Too many people like this and the Devs of this game just don't care. They made their money so screw the people that play the game. I will never buy another game from this publisher. Too poorly managed of a game. Look at the time I have spent in this game. I know what I am talking about with it. The Devs of this game are horrible it would almost make you think it was EA it's so badly run. Truly the Devs of this game a ing s. If you ever get a chance to spit in their hypocrite faces please take it.8/2/18 I was told I was being unfair to this game and the Devs so I came back to try and see if they had cleaned things up or not. NO it's actually worse. I GOT BOOTED FROM YOUR SERVER IN A RANKED GAME AND I GET BANNED FOR LEAVING. Fix your ing game your worthless dip . I am so ing sick of publishers that leave huge mistakes like that. I am tired of being penalized for your programming. The next time I get banned for YOUR SERVER dropping me I sue your stupid asses for breach of contract.,Rocket League®

2018-11-20,0,0,1117,False,Recommended,There is truly no other game like Rocket League in the world. It is often said that this game feels more like a true sports game than video games created based on real life sports. This is due mainly to it being entirely physics based. The ball bounces off of your car differently based on how fast you are moving relative to the ball the angle of your car what part of the ball you hit and many other factors. You practice shooting the ball just as you would any real life sport. It requires timing finesse and muscle memory to pull off shots well.Your car has several abilities including jumping boosting and dodging. Jumping and boosting allows you to fly through the air to hit the ball. Dodging allows you to perform front/back flips diagonal flips and barrel rolls to move around the field faster and hit the ball with more power. These are all accomplished entirely by applying physical forces on the car rather than by animation. As an unintended concequence of the physically based nature of the game new mechanics are always being discovered that continue to raise the skill ceiling. Just one example of such a mechanic this is the wave dash. A wave dash is acheived by dodging in such a way that the wheels slam into the ground transferring the rotational torque of the dodge into linear momentum giving you an instant boost of speed.Aside from the mechanics of the game there is also a huge strategy component to it as well. Positioning yourself correctly based on the positioning of your teammates and your opponents is very important. Being in the wrong place at the wrong time can result in you conceding a goal. If you give your opponent too much space they can utilize that space to wind up for a powerful shot on your goal. At higher ranks players begin to anticipate when you'll hit the ball and will jump early to intercept the ball. You can exploit this by feinting a touch sending them flying past you and leaving their goal open for a free shot.With all that said the game does suffer from server issues and the community is known for being very toxic.,Rocket League®

Yes the game seems fun and relaxing but from the point where you learn the basics you will suck until youre a pro and even then can happen thats just as . Also even if you have a good internet connection don't expect to get a good server with a good ping. Yes they exist but mostly you will get either servers with t ping or enemies/mates with t ping and ping means so much in this game. And now (maybe its only me) the game crashed 4 times in 4 days 2 minutes after i started the game. WTF? Just don't get it if you have anxiety or any else psychological problems. And if you don't have them Congrats! Play for 50 hours and you will get them! Don't get me wrong the game can be fun yes. But the times you rage because of the enemies luck your unluck or the t ping aren't worth it.,Rocket League®

The physics engine still needs some fine tuning. the devs would rather add new crates and items to make more money than fix these minor problems. Dislike/Like system is still broken. Servers cause lag ONLY on this game. I can play other games and will play fine. Smurfs and trolls are very common (Not as much in my lvl). Ok time for a positive part You now get automatically banned for saying offensive words! Im glad to see this chat being cleansed of filth!

Consistent updates every two ish months give or take of course. Been playing since 2015 and I still love this game like its the first time I played. If you're considering purchasing this game just give it a shot you have two hours to see if its a concept you really like or not. I can say that it will probably take around 15 to 20 hours to really tell if you like the concept. The controls will feel awkward at first for sure but it comes with time.

I found this feature very cool but... when I get rammed my game not only crashed my pc freezes leaving me to have to shutdown my pc by pressing the button. I am very not impressed with this.EDIT Obviously Rocket league updated this bug and this game is wonderful and is now 100% worth buying.

It is easily a must have in your library if you like a) having fun b) rc cars c) soccer d) crashing randomly and flying around an rc soccer arena. If you like any of those things you will definitely love this game. It is honest worth way more than the 20 dollar asking price on it. 10/10 game.""The above was posted when the game was new and it felt fun and refreshing. Nowadays the only way to enjoy the game or to have a chance at having fun with it is to play the game and train to get to be the best. The fun game modes are only populated with people who spend entirely too much time in the game and even the ""different game modes"" (hoops snow day and rumble) are populated with people who do nothing but waste their lives on the game. I really don't see how a game with this sort of learning curve for something so simple can be enjoyable to a casual player which is why I'm changing the review to negative. Even playing the fun game modes listed above has too long of a queue for very little or no fun involved whatsoever. The game used to feel fun when no one knew what they were doing but now all the game has devolved into is aerials and flashy plays that put a casual player like myself at a huge disadvantage.Uninstalled and never to be installed again.

From RPGs racing sims action adventures puzzlers MMOs...eventually my time with them passes. But not Rocket League. The gameplay is about as perfect as you will find in any game. So simple to learn and understand and yet somehow incredibly deep once you play around and experiment with it. The huge range of skill levels amazes me even after the 1000+ hours I've sank into it whilst I could now run circles around 'old me' from back when I began playing I still encounter countless players who end up doing just that to me today. The drive to keep competing and improving my game is always there.I honestly struggle to imagine a time to come where I will stop playing and enjoying Rocket League.

I recommend if both for casual and serious play. The community is great (with few exceptions) and new things are being added all the time.

2017-06-04,0,0,1539,False,Recommended,Product received for free. This is a very good game. The graphics are nice the physics are great but some of the maps just don't work well on all computers. Also sometimes (more often than you think) the matchmaking is unfair. For example 2 people in silver 1 going against 2 people in silver 3 (2 ranks up). The worst part about this game is its community. Whatever you do do not solo queue. There are many people that will cuss you out and I've asked my teammates if they could do one thing (For example please rotate behind me so we can 2v1 the guy) and they would report me for being toxic cuss me out and stop playing (or purposely own goal). Also doing 1v1 is very stressing as well bc people will try tactics to get you and the problem even if you report them they won't get banned bc they're doing it within the terms of service. They use quickchat demo or use curse words that aren't regulated for bans. Overall it's a really addicting game just don't play alone or you will end up getting really mad.,Rocket League®
