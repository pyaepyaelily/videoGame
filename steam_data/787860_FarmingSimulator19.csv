71,76949478,english,"I originally started with FS17 on console and really didn't know about available mods for money cheats and didn't quite understand the use of mods so I did it the hard way and worked up from scratch by taking contracts and running those long jobs.   Buying land bit by bit.  I could make $50,000 on one harvest job.  I made like $40 million the hard way before moving on to FS19 Platinum edition.  The livestock in FS17 became lucrative as I was making $200,000 a day on milk and regularly selling thousands of pigs at a time for millions of dollars.  After playing FS19 on XBox One for awhile I discovered streamers on the channels who were using all these great mods that I didn't have access to.  Because they were only on PC.  So I bought the PC version.  Although I didn't do much with livestock with FS19 on Xbox.  I did that when I went to FS19 on PC.  And I found it disappointing because it's not that lucrative.  Cows don't produce enough manure, slurry, or milk to be worth the time having them.  They're not a money maker, they're a decoration.   The pigs are also anal-retentive.  If you want a lot of manure in FS19 you must construct a mod to buy it.  Also the volume of livestock is restricted by the pens available.   Many of the Cow Barns, pens, etc., that I experimented with had dump points that didn't work properly or were inside structures that prevented me from dumping my big truck trailers.  And the trucks would get stuck and need to be re-set.  A lot of the cow corral mods are broken.   The pigs were unsatisfying and so were the chickens.  You don't even need to water the chickens, they don't eat hardly anything, and their egg production is pathetic no matter how many of them you buy.  The sheep produce a pathetically small amount of wool.  The horses are for amusement, not production.   Although a horse breeding mod is available.  I was amazed at how low-maintenance are the livestock.  They're no work at all.  I kept checking back in, amazed, thinking, I still have no work to do here?  In FS17 they were a lot of work for a big reward.  In FS19 the livestock are very little work for very little reward.    The breeding rates of the livestock in FS19 is also slow.  In summary, the livestock in FS19 suck.   But I'm not trying to trash a great game.  And FS19 is a great game worth the money.  There are so many available maps and an incredible amount of mods available.  There are huge maps where you can take harvesting numbers to astronomical levels.  With Course Play this takes the entire game to a new level.   Socking away astronomical amounts of crops in a silo that will take 30 million liters.  One a couple maps the given silo was 100 million capacity.   Obtaining the mods can be ominous as some sites are full of adware and malware.  Right now I'm working on the Mining and Construction Economy map.  But I am disappointed by the limitations of the livestock on the other maps.  And it's very likely I will soon be buying Farming Simulator 17 Platinum on PC here on Steam and explore the available mods I never saw on console.  Because I might want to see what it is like to try to raise 2000 cows and 10,000 pigs.  And explore some of the larger maps I  never saw on console.  Hopefully in the next installment GIANT will get the livestock right.  Animals should be a productive element of the farm.

7,76836041,english,"I'm not a farmer, but I can imagine this is what being one is like. This game isn't perfect, but let me tell you what I do like about it. There are so many real-life and well-detailed pieces of equipment and vehicles in this game that it's basically farm equipment porn. They all handle (I suppose) how they would IRL, and that feels wonderful. The harvesters have weight, the trailers sway on bumps, etc. It's a little complicated figuring out what piece of equipment is used for, but most of them you don't really have to pay attention to unless you want to dive really deep with this game. The environments are gorgeous and scenic and you can almost smell the grass.

What I don't like about it is more than a few things, so my recommendation is kind of a 45-degree angle thumbs up. For some inexplicable reason the pickup truck physics are floaty as hell and they turn way too damn quick. Also for whatever reason Giants couldn't get licensed brands for the pickups and American big rigs, very weird. There's no crash damage in this game. I went head-on into another driver at 70 and stopped dead with no damage. You can fling your truck off a cliff, have it do 10 barrel rolls and pirouettes in mid-air, have it land right side up and drive away like nothing happened. What even is that?

The cities feel empty. People dot the streets but they're ghosts you can drive right through. Can't talk to anyone, can't even run anybody over. The other physics are sometimes wonky, like loading logs or picking up items. Your player character is some kind of superhuman who can leap on top of buildings and climb up almost vertical cliff faces. There's no third-person mode. In the default game there's only 2 maps, despite hundreds of pieces of equipment. Parts of the economy are kind of weird and nonsensical. And why can you drive the train? You can't load anything on it, you can't do anything with it.

Overall, a very fun game as long as you focus on the FARMING aspect of Farming Simulator and don't look too deep under the hood, because there ain't much there. 6.5/10",1601509028,1601509028,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198049877485,57,23,2595,1728,1371,1602031676,,

You all have made great improvements although many were mods before you guys added them lol but the AI still isn't bug free. I like that we can create fields and such but there is no point when the AI get confused in certain areas and when the not so dynamic map doesn't update with the new fields created. For the second thing, I recently wanted to buy some of the DLC content you have offered. But noticed that the season pass is only offered to new comers... This is a bit frustrating and dare I say rude to myself and any other veteran players. Please, fix this issue and allow us all to enjoy a discount and new content. And please fix the dang AI! lmao it is getting old and quite sad at this point. P.S. I'll buy FS21 when it is available... maybe because I am a sucker? lol I own FS11, FS13, FS15, FS17, and FS19, so might as well own FS21.

I was expecting alot from this game as i'm sure people coming from FS17 was,  I play only multiplayer as i have since FS11 and this is honestly the worst FS ever. It is really sad to see PC games being over ruled by consoles but sadly i feel like farming sim has given in. dropping things like interactive controls and who ever says the graphics are different for the glitchy bales and no interactive controls at all on mods, just doesn't make the cut. why should you buy a game, flood it with mods just to make it reasonably fun to play,  The modding community is amazing and what makes this game fun but honestly feels like Giant has taken a massive set back. why couldn't they just update FS17 if that damn thing is going to be the same.  
With a game like Cattle and Crops being realised i really thought they would of stepped up the game taken in what the modders did and develop that with the funding Giant have. 


I hope the next FS is better but looks likes consoles are winning,    Project Cars 3 is just the same.     PS5 here i come........

There are many amazing mods for the game and they have pushed me over the 1100 hours mark but a new FS is needed and now I feel that in 2021 I'll be left with an old game propped up my mods :/   |-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|   Original review: It took many updates to get to this quality, with some going backwards like my G920 steering wheel not working properly at launch, to fixed, then to randomly broken, the fps going up and down with each patch. There were many issues after launch which simply shouldn't have happened, but I'm happy to say that most have been fixed now. It's good to know that Giants are listening to the community and this has made me confident in the game again.I would still like to see the draw distance changed so that on max settings, the trees don't dumb down and objects disappear, I mean if I can see for miles and miles in every other sim game, why can't I in FS19? Perhaps it's because the consoles have won the day and the higher end PC's are now the minority :/The game play needs no information from me as it's all explained now on the store page sections, comments, previews and on Youtube.So to round up this review.Right now this game is at its best and well worth buying, plus those players that walked away due to the multitude of problems should jump back in and give it another go.",1542782644,1600226596,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198091774118,104,42,71762,0,50522,1599055966,,

64,76038907,english,"Is this the most realistic modern farming experience? Yes. Is it fun? Sometimes.

Most of the issues I'm going to talk about can be mitigated with mods, maps, etc. However, I want to provide a point of view for people who don't want to mod the game a bunch to get it to what I'd consider a fun state.

Graphics: They're good and more or less what I'd expect from the genre. They're nothing fancy, but they're hardly bad. Nothing more to say without getting nit-picky.

Sound: The sound is good. It is also nothing amazing or bad.

Gameplay: Oooh boy... This is good and bad. I'm going to split this up into sections below. I'll just say that I'm playing on keyboard and mouse, so bear that in mind. I don't really have the money to buy a setup for a specialized controller. I could also probably get good results from an xbox controller as well. 

Maps: I HATE the map design for the default maps. Ravenport isn't bad. I like the layout of the shops and roads, but I hate the fields. I also feel like you're required to back into way too many spots. 

General Gameplay: This game is REALLY slow. I knew this going in of course, but I didn't realize that it would be quite this slow. Yes, I realize you can adjust the time multiplier but this doesn't effect your farming machines speed. It only effects the grow speed of crops and the flux of prices. 

Modding: The best part is most of this can be fixed with mods. Mods are very easy to install and can make your game into pretty much what you want. For example, because I'm playing with keyboard and mouse, I opted to get a mod to load pallets and bags automatically as running a forklift with keyboard and mouse isn't really intuitive. All in all, I like this game, but think it definitely needs mods to be playable.",1600205078,1600205078,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561197983022700,603,35,524,17,497,1601424448,,

Then there is the recent Kverneland and Vicon equipment pack I could go on and on.

When it was announced that there will not be a Farming simulator 21 I was looking forward to the continued support and updates to this, instead as I should have expected we are expecting a ""premium edition"" on top of the already platinum edition as well as an alpine farming expansion with hardly any content for exorbitant prices this was the last straw as far as I am concerned.

HOW DO YOU DO THAT keep making something worse everytime! FS19 does have much better graphics and a bigger feel to the map but maps are full of bugs more bugs that a 40yr old grain bin!
The models of the tractors are much better and have more animations to them, but not enough of the needed equipment!
The new placeables system is an awesome idea but not enough and not all that is needed, The teraforming feature is absolute rubbish!
This game should be EARLY ACCESS not full price !!!! But thats what all the AAA pubs are doing so....
Overall I would say don't buy yet wait until many patches have come out or it is priced like an Early Access!!!!!
UPDATE
2/5/2019 Still buggy but getting better, Still only ONE map worth playing and the American Map is just an insult to me, if that is Truly how Giants see's America then please Stop selling your crap in the US. So sorry for this company but definatly my last purchase from this DEV!
UPDATE
8/30/2020
Lots of more DLC LOTS but guess what the AI is still just as bad as it was on release, I have as of yet seen a helper AI finish a field still missing spots or going completly off into a different field.

You start a farm, you gradually build up to bigger and faster equipment, adding more and more land as you expand. Then you get bored. Then you start a new map. Then you run out of stock maps and decide to give mods a try. At this point you are irredeemable. 

The next thing you know, you're like me. Sitting on 1,350 hours and 5 completed farms and you're lonely. So you think, ah I know. I'll involve my friends. 

So you throw together a mod pack, get everyone on the same page and generally enjoy your time. Everyone finds their own little niche and does well working together. Then one by one they fade away, because they're not addicted like you are, and they find doing the same thing over and over a bore and repetitive because they don't have a second monitor to watch videos on the side or listen to their perfectly crafted motivational farming music playlist like you. 

So now you have 6 or 7 farms that you're the sole caretaker of, and you're always browsing the mods and watching farming simulator videos on YouTube to see if there's any new maps that catch your eye. Oh, and of course, you'll pre-order the new one as soon as it's announced, because who knows what new lands you'll tame?

(of course it was sunny and 100 degrees outside) FS19 presents a perfect blend of simulation and real time strategy. The environment is very dynamic and natural, the vehicles are highly detailed, and different game play modes offer different levels of challenges... I would have enjoyed more selections of classic American Tractors that I saw growing up, but FS19 does have an active mod community, and after a few minutes browsing the content, modification should be straightforward. content is managed with .xml and uses common image formats... i have been too busy playing to look, but there is probably a blender plug in to manage the geometry.... for many years, everytime I saw Farming Simulator on a store shelf, I would look at the images and think, i dont have the disk space, my machine wont handle the graphics.... I wasted a lot of time.... The install was under 10gig, the graphics are fantastic and i have not yet dropped a frame... FS19 runs rock solid on my generic off the shelf laptop.

15,74543398,english,"Decent game if you like grinding for things. Essentially that's what this comes down to. You work your fields to make money to buy more fields and bigger equipment to work the fields better. Repeat until you own all the fields and the biggest toys. 

The gameplay is pretty simple. There are basic rules and steps to follow for the different types of crops that you grow and the livestock you can keep. The vehicles themselves are all well modelled but I felt a bit more like I was playing with toy farm equipment than actually 'simulating' their driving. Don't expect this to be the 'iRacing' of tractor games, it's more arcade. There is no damage modelling. Collisions do nothing but bump you around and vehicle handling is more like GTA. Still that does allow you to focus more on the farm management and less on learning to drive a harvester. Also wheel support was pretty sparse. My G27 worked but the game offers very little configuration options. Had to do a lot of tweaking outside the game to get it feeling right.

All in all though Farming Simulator was a fun, relaxed experience. Definitely a change of pace from most other games. It does what it does well, that is farm management, and there are a ton of different vehicles to drive, equipment to try, crops to grow and animals to raise.

Not for everyone but definitely check it out if you're interested in farming or just want a relaxed, grindy, time management game to chill out to.",1597814282,1597814282,True,1,0,0.506849288940429688,0,True,False,False,76561197971309565,303,48,9943,0,6102,1598769219,,

Cons:
 Crop textures need to be updated 
 Ground detail where it so rough every thing looks like its bouncing around all over the place.
 This goes with the ground being rough they need to put  suspension on the vehicle. 
 Steering control could be improved on.

You can expect to spend countless hours, growing and modifying and expanding. Choose the type of crop or animal etc, maintain the field etc its good. 

However what i find bad is the awful physics engine. When you decide to go logging, and you start to use machines to manipulate wood. Its like summoning a demon that haunts the game. Wood begins to do things you can't explain. You get frustrated because its so stupid to control. So logging is good money but awful without mods that imo is cheating.  Also i feel as though certain mod should be stock. The ai needs to be better. There needs to be more crops. Dev's should also look more into the processing side of things aswell.

You can even change terrain features with the in-game map editor. There are also countless mods with equipment and maps so the possibilities are endless.
If you're willing to invest in some controllers I highly recommend getting a steering wheel/pedal set along with a joystick because this makes the game that much more realistic and fun.

16,73857101,english,"I dont have a huge amount of hours under my belt for this game but enough to know two things. It's both brilliant and not so in equal measure.

What I like:
Do (almost) whatever you want - There's a pretty good choice of farming to specialize in.
The farm machinery is sensational, the selection and realism is very good and just shopping for new toys is fun by itself.
Relaxation - Really is a game that soothes your soul as you learn about things like PTO shafts and yields.
Mods - To be quite honest, the game is nothing without them.


What I dont like:
It's all very 1 dimensional - Grow/harvest/sell and repeat. I would love a more enriched commerce feature. Like, adding value to your crops in a factory and selling to the open market with other players (Mods exists for this kind of play but they can be clunky)
Multiplayer - tried a few times, found it messy and buggy and laggy...all the y's
BUGS - I mean the game is around since 2008 and your tractor still ends up on it's side like your Granny with a bad hip
AI - it's very limited,  you really should be able to hire workers to do the full harvest from start to finish


Overall:
The game is nice to play for a while but too reliant on mods and I fear the devs are happy to let the community do the hard work. I think it really needs to be taken to the next level in future releases with an enriched multiplayer, GPS, better AI plus more game mechanics that allow you to do more with your crops then just sell the raw product.

I give it a recommendation based on the fact I paid <€30 and the modding community.",1596709802,1596709802,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198028283688,33,2,3324,0,3324,1596661552,,

If you like relaxing, strategy/time management games and get inspired by a seemingly endless array of machinery and other things to strive for, then  you'll probably enjoy the game. But that's not why I'm bothering to write this review. I'm writing this review because the most remarkable thing about this game is how well it works. In a sea of games that struggle to provide what they promise, this game is amazing.

I have 68 mods activated, and the game takes less than 10 seconds to load and start. I have 6 fields, tons of equipment and placeables, co-op partners, half-a-dozen AI workers going at once, etc. and the game has never once dipped below the 60 FPS that I have it set at--and I'm playing on a laptop. I've had the game crash once and that was on a custom map-created by a modder-that conflicted with one of my mods.

Speaking of mods, the modding is incredible. You can install mods directly from the in-game menu, or you can go to their mod-hub website and download them to the mod folder. Super easy. There are so many great mods that it extends the playability by a considerable margin. Many mods are uploaded by the developers themselves, including bonus maps from previous versions of the game and many equipment packs. They could sell these as DLC, but they give them away for free.

I'm just very impressed. Big thumbs up.",1596025440,1596025554,True,46,0,0.782683730125427246,0,True,False,False,76561198027584793,860,149,27845,914,6595,1601739249,,

83,73024463,english,"As someone who has never played any of the Farming Simulator series, and this is my first time playing it, I would like to share my opinions about this game.

The game at first seems really difficult to understand, and frankly, it was kind of frustrating. But with tutorials, searching online for videos with tips or pages with useful information in them, and some playing, I really got the hang of it. Once you learn how Plowing, Cultivation, Sowing, etc. works, you pretty much go on your business with planting your favorite grains, or any of the other types the game has to offer. The graphical aspect of the game is amazing, no complaints there, although if you want, you can also download textures. The way the different machines work is just astonishing and really satisfying. The level of detail in each one of the machines is beautiful and I could not ask for better than that. To be honest, I really like big machines such as Harvesters, because they have that something about them which makes you want to use them. The game is superbly relaxing when you're just sowing or harvesting something on your field/s, or just when you drive around to deliver chaff, for example. 
The amount of machines you can work with and use is totally ENOUGH for me (and that might be true for you too), although you can buy the dlcs which would add more options in your machinery sections, depending on what you're working on. You can also download great mods depending on what you need (Certain cultivators for corn for example). I would say one thing though; If you're planning on growing sugarcanes, know that your options are almost NON-EXISTENT, that is because you have only one machine to work with and attaching a trailer to it is useless as the trailers that DO fit are small in their capacity, as harvesting sugarcanes gives huge amounts of it and you'll need a friend that will help you with the trailer part or, just use some mods.
Working on your field and growing grains and crops and getting the reward, in the end, is what makes me keep playing the game. 
You have 3 modes which you have to pick one of them, ""New farmer"" which is for newbies, ""Farm manager"" which is for amateur+ players who already have learned how to play, and ""Start from scratch"" which is for the expert players who truly feel they're up for a challenge.
The gameplay part is great, and its really easy to play with a keyboard once you memorize all the buttons for all the controls (The same goes for controller users too). You can buy many fields, and if two maps aren't enough for you, you can download user-made content which will make playing the game even more fun and it will last much, much longer. This game takes time to master and understand, so don't skip the tutorials as they are your starting point.
Before buying the game I was thinking if I would even play it, but I am glad that I purchased the game. 
I can write more about the game but for now, I'll let you decide if you want to buy the game or not. I would totally recommend the game to a friend. 10/10.",1595288108,1595948575,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198135419274,127,20,4198,0,1543,1596363302,,

Farm like never before they said ! but it all looks very much like FS17 style, fields stuck side by side with no effort to seperate them, to look anything like the promo video, Hardly any placables to build your farm just 1 farmhouse to choose from not good for a new game. Roll on when the community makes some decent maps.... So having played FS17 which i liked THEN BUYING THIS THINKING IT WAS GOING BE A BIG DIFFERANCE......  I CANT REALLY RECOMMEND IT sorry...........   Edited .....Been playing this Sim a long time and there's no getting away from it it's a great sim but it annoys me that there's no on going improvements or new fetures added only DLC content which i dont' buy, there's still lots that can be improved like when loading bails some time they wobble or stick to other things or even fly about a hundred ft in the air, or in the landscape tool there's no undo i have had to start many a new game because i pressed the wrong key ........always they leave these type of fix's until the new version and perhaps not fix or add many new fetures then but it is the best out there at the moment............",1542986885,1595936638,True,0,0,0.424342125654220581,0,True,False,False,76561197996222252,49,8,61351,0,1010,1600478065,,

The UI is organized and easy to navigate. The gameplay is scale-able for a wide range of computers and consoles. Admittedly, its a totally nerdy game, but I'm a proud nerd, so this is right up my alley. I recommend the DLC because its just a small amount of paid content, when sooo much content is available for free. So it's sort of out of a feeling of obligation... or guilt... I most likely need therapy. But, real talk: some of the in game DLC is free, so you just do whatever you feel is right. New player-created mods regularly come out at a rate of more than 5 per week. That's more than 5 free downloads all accessible from within the game, each week.

My suggestion to the developers is to revisit the tutorial and add a basics tutorial that shows how to get started, I looked through the key bindings and found nothing stating how to fuel your vehicle and tried every pump while being in and out of the vehicle and found no possible way to get gas in my tractor. this seems like it was slapped together quickly with a smaller map and no direction and I don't suggest purchasing this, purchase Farming Simulator 17 it's much better from what i can see, very disappointed this should have been so much better then Farming Simulator 17, cheap imitation.",1594866515,1594866515,False,2,0,0.5,0,True,False,False,76561198107499965,80,74,76,0,76,1594863510,,

My only complaint is the game is to euro. It kind of ruins the immersion of playing as a US farmer when I can't pronounce the names of half of my equipment. ""Oh yeah.. I love driving rasabahabadubahdah!"" Said the Farmer in total confusion.

Not slagging euro products but there is a lot of missing gear in this game. A lot more than I would expect from the 2019 version. Where is Kubota? Mahindir? Yes I know they aren't American but both are very common in the US. 

There are a lot of great mods that add in more gear in this game. But it's a real chore to download the 900 or so different mods needed to make the game feel authentic. I wish they came as a pack. On the plus side downloading and installing mods is probably easier in this game than in any other I have played. Even if you use the mods that don't install through the game client. Just drag a zip file into your documents/mygames/fs2019 folder and boom. All done! 

This is a great name and this franchise really needs to keep going. Hopefully somebody in the modding community will figyre  out how to pack 10-20 mods into one big download.

Then, I took my harvestor and got that stuck as well. 

At the end of that game, I had no money and all my equipment was stuck. I tried to un-stuck some of it with a fork lift but the fork lift's arms are weak and can't lift any of the vehicles. I also tried bringing arms in the middle and then just driving into a vehicle but that didn't work either. 

I also couldn't just keep walking into a vehicle to move it a little bit. It's usually possible in some other games but not in this one.

There are other types of Farming sims out there and I own them all.  They are each fun in their own way, but nothing comes close to a fun afternoon (or complete day and night) on the fantasy farm like Farm Simulator 19.  I've been called a fanboy for my views.  I guess I am a 53 year old fanboy with real farming experience, that really likes to get away and enjoy myself.

Next they redid the Menu Based System. It appears their focus was based on game compatibility  with Computer Tablets. I run a computer with decent graphic, the whole menuing system and associated iconography lacks graphic detail and is just cluncky looking on a PC. This being  July of 2020, I was disapointed with the in game MODs available. I like the in game Publicly available Down Load Content (PDLC) but it just wasn't enough for my tastes.

Nice atmosphere
Well-explained controls
Plenty of content
Fitting music

Negatives:
Some things are extremely unclear, like the second small tractor has the option for a Front Loader, but when I try attaching Front Loaders it does NOT work. 
I wish there were more details with every vehicle and product to show what goes with what. Pretty frustrating figuring it out on your own and having to google everything. The tutorial didn't help with this.
For example. The pallet of fertillizer; have a little text under it with: You can move this with [type of vehicle]. Those small details will make it more enjoyable for new players.",1594033041,1594033041,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198057482716,208,15,364,0,204,1594045913,,

92,71855103,english,"I was trying to think of how I wanted to review this game myself in a way that would best reflect my views on this game. Despite the 45 hours I've put into this game on Steam, I have also previously put around 264 hours into this game on the Epic Games Launcher (yes, I know what others think of the launcher. I don't care, I just use it to get free game) which totals my hours of gameplay to over 309 hours across both launchers.

Anyway, down to the review.

I recall thinking and saying something to myself some years back, roughly when I think FS17 came out, but it might also be FS19, I'm not sure. That thing was this, ""This game looks stupid, I'd never play this."" Fast forward to this year when they released it for free on the EGS and I started playing it, now also owning it here on Steam.

I do genuinely like this game, with the models of different equipment types from vehicles to trailers being well modeled and accurately represented. The graphics are also pretty dang good even on my low end hardware, which I found to be pretty pleasing. I have also come to enjoy how the game works with mods without much issues, which is also great.

Pros:

- Graphics look great, can't complain about how the game looks.

- Equipment representation is well-done and accurate, down to very small details.

- I like the brand variety in the game, giving a lot of choice for most uses.

Cons:

- The land editor could use some improvement and work, as I don't find it to be very good.

- The traffic AI isn't great and could use some tweaking.

-  The game has some mods that I have used that I think could be actual features in the game. Mods like Additional Field Information, Passenger Mod, God Hand, and more quality of life improvements.

- Being on a server is miserable, because the game freezes for a moment whenever someone joins, which makes being in any public server not worth it.

(This review might be updated if need be)

22,71833652,english,Ya this game is a huge downgrade from 17. Yes there is more vehicles and some other features that i found to be great editions. However one thing in this game ruins the entire thing. THE HARVESTERS ARE BROKEN and the headers get stuck on hills constantly. I mean good god this a game breaking bug in my opinion as it has made harvesting certain crops (sunflowers and corn) almost impossible. The fix although not to complex varies from harvester to harvester and person to person. Also requires tweaking xml files. Time consuming and honestly has not worked. Plus from my research this has been an issue since the game has released over a year ago and Giant STILL HAVE NOT FIXED IT which is unexceptable considering how envasive of a bug it has been. Well until they stop being lazy or a mod is made that fixes it I will be returning to Farm Sim 17 and reccomend others to do the same.

38,71774257,english,"I had mixed emotions when the game first came out. There was a lot of things about the game that I really liked, but at the same time, some I didnt like. I have a list of some of those things.
Likes.
1) The graphics.
The graphics in this game were a huge step up from FS 17. And while having great graphics, the game is also fairly optimized. My Ryzen 5 and RTX 2070 ran this game beautifully, and I didnt think my other pc with an i3 4150 and gtx 1050 ti could match that. But to my surprise, the game ran perfectly at the same settings! So lets move onto the next thing.
2) In game brands.
There are many tractor, harvester, equipment, etc brands in the game. They have alot of really good brands when it comes to just about everything. From John Deer, to Massey Ferguson, you can choose what you want and how you want it. Though, it would be nice to have some vehicle brands aswell, like Ford or Chevy but those are just very small details.
3)  Crops and their physics.
The physics for the crops are pretty good. If you accidentally drive over your crops the bend, but dont always fall. With small vehicles they pop back up, but if you are using a Semi or heavy tractor, you better be careful!

Dislikes.
1) Animal physics.
It was disappointing seeing the animal physics once the game actually released. In the game commercial they made having a dog, or riding a horse seem like something fun to add to the game. In the end, it was not. Riding a horse is clunky, and not very enjoyable. As for the dog, it just kinda snaps in the direction it needs to go and you cant do anything asides from give it food and throw the ball. No getting it in the truck like in the commercial. Livestock could also use some new physics. In the end, I believe they could hire someone else to deal with those physics.
2) AI.
The AI can be annoying depending on how you drive or what you are doing. It is very annoying when something falls off a trailer in the road and the AI keep getting as close as they can so you cannot move it or load it back on, or when you have a wide load that gets sideswiped and knocked off by an AI. Small detail, but depending on what you are doing they can be a real heartache. 
I could write a lot more about the game, but it would take to long for me to write, and you to read. In the end I recommend the game as it can be quite addicting.",1593568936,1593568936,True,0,0,0,1,True,False,False,76561198306004538,58,9,4730,0,3035,1596315736,,

Still lots of great machinery to play with and of course lots to grow, animals to keep etc. The biggest improvement for me is the editing tools to change the land to how you want it. In the old version you placed a building (often on grass) and that was it. This new one lets you change the floor types so you can add paths, pads and driveways. You can also change the levels so the whole farm flows much better. A few more jobs to do in this version. Huge number of really good free mods.

And if you need further assistance, the Farming Simulator players are some of the most helpful players I've run into.

Graphics in FS19 are the best in the series, with a newly revamped engine. Highly detailed equipment and realistic day/night effects and lighting are great. What's not great is the lack of optimization, with my 2080 struggling to maintain 80+ FPS with all settings on max @ 1440p.

There is not much to offer besides the John Deer integration and a graphics overhaul. Most of which you could acheive give or take with mods in previous installments. 

If FS19 is going to be your first Farm Simulator, then yes I can recommend it.

However if you're coming out of FS17, I have yet to see anything new for returning players --- in fact it plays feels and operates like FS17 with enhancement mods.

I was hoping there would be more vehicular simulation; traction simulation, load bearing limits.... 

The only improvement I've seen is the level of detail on things like motors and parts. 

...this installment is not innovative in any way. 

The default maps seem to leave a lot to be desired particularly Ravenport, where your starting farm is cradled by mountains and the farm hands literally cannot navigate your fields because of it. My first 4 minutes in I told a guy to plow the field and another to harvest the starting field while I went and sold some unneeded equipment. I come back and find both the harvester and the tractor parked up a cliff side. 

This game is Farming Simulator 17 repainted.

Yes the graphics are good, yes the machinery is still authentic enough but for what you get its not really worth it if you already own Farming Simulator 17.

Truth be told though my first few minutes in I got a little nauseous at the soft shadows everywhere while my seat and camera was bouncing like mad in the cab.

I think I'll go back to FS17 where the gameplay meant more than the graphics.

With games like Euro Truck Simulator 2, Spintires, and previous installments of Farming Simulator out there, I admit expected a lot to compete, but did not expect this little...

This game is ridiculously relaxing, rewarding, and enjoyable. There's a lot more than just ""farming"" too. There's the aspect of building a farm, laying out where buildings will go, organizing tractors, trucks, and tools. There's the whole financial strategy part too; do i buy this tractor, lease it, or continue to use the old basic piece of junk for another harvest or two, and should i plant corn and turn it into silage, or plant soybeans for profit, maybe plant oat and bale the straw afterwards? It's just crazy how much honestly goes on in a simple simulator. And with mods, this game can even become a farm manager game as you send workers out to plow, cultivate, harvest, transport crop, etc.

I love it though. I can work all day, getting stressed and frustrated, but then come home and relax as I just let the tractor drive lines up and down a field planting, or use a harvester to collect crops, and it's just so damn easy to get lost in.

I know a lot of people look at Farming Sim and laugh, but this is honestly one of the best games I've put my time into. I mean, 568 hrs at this point in time...

9,71210067,english,"The perfect game to chill out. I have not played previous FS games so my opinion is from someone completely new to the series.

At the beginning you'll get stablished with a piece of land, and some cheap tools. You have to sow your fields, make grow and take care of them, and harvest your profits. With the money you'll eventually get new equipment, and so on, and so on.

It's the perfect game to relax after an stressful day of work at the office, or to disconnect your mind of that important project and his deadline. You only have to put some music/radio/podcast, relax and start to enjoy by working on your fields.

This game as odd as it sounds, it's extremely addictive even when it's EXTREMELY repetitive. You will always have an objective on mind (buy that impressive tractor, take care of your chickens or horses, expand your farm with a great piece of land or do the favor that neighbor is asking for). No matter that you have to work on the same fields over and over again. You feel your crops, your farm (and even your dog) as ""yours"", and you really have to look after them.

As for the simulation aspect of the game, the machinery is beatifully recreated. With all his working parts that you have to operate (deploy, start, etc.), it's really amazing. You will use the flashing lights on the road, the beacon lights when working on the crops,... the attention to detail and the interior cockpits are great. The physics of the fields are amazingly modelled, when your tractor/tool gets in contact, it's really nicely done. You have to watch your speed or some maneuvers if you don't want to roll your tractor and damage everything. The level of simulation is fully customizable, from an easy experience to a more demanding game. I play with an Xbox One pad although I would love to try some special farming sim peripherals. It supports TrackIr which works as expected.

Unfortunately the visuals, depiste great things like the tractors and tools models, the beautiful (germany) map , and some lighting conditions where the game looks stunning, the overall is that it has some flaws like the drawing distance (even expanding it in the developer options menu), some textures that doesn't look that great and the fact that is not well optimized, although I play it at 1440p with all maxed out at +100fps (i7-8700k, rtx2070,32gb ram), it feels that it still needs some polish or maybe a major graphics engine update. Anyway this goes to the background the moment you get hooked to it.

If you like games like ETS2, PC Building or Car Mechanic Simulators, etc. this game is for you. You decide your level of challenge and game pace. You can use it to wind down from more demanding games (after a tense session of flying or racing sims, this game fits perfectly).

Sometimes the situation has been inverted and I need to switch to more serious games to stop playing this FS'19.",1592893764,1592893764,True,23,1,0.713216245174407959,0,True,False,False,76561198334534870,82,7,7430,207,5019,1601935909,,

✔
It doesn't comprehend all of the intricacies of actual farming but nonetheless operating the machines and performing tasks is quite relaxing and fun.
The tractors are satisfactorily animated, in particular the independent suspension and tyre pressure. Overall unfolding the implements and working with them is also entertaining.

There's a lot of different stuff to try out and it provides lots of playtime.

❌
The downsides are the crappy DLCs as well as the fact that it's a bit superficial. It would be nice if the game allowed the players to actually immerse themselves in the farming world by punishing rough driving, requiring the player to hook the implements and trailers, connecting hydraulic lines, air lines, electricals, PTO, etc., plowing, sowing and harvesting in timely manner, etc. ...

Hopefully the sequels in this series will tackle this. It's understandable that it's a huge game.

68,71024012,english,"Having no interest in farming it's strange how compelling this game is to play. The fact that you construct your own world to play in, modify it extensively with external mods and then interact with almost everything you make is, perhaps , what makes it fun to play. 

The only let down is the profoundly poor game engine that it runs on. It's poorly optimized with no real atmospherics in the game world and poorly implemented physics and collision detection. Even on a high end system this game struggles to hold 60FPS and frame drops and stuttering are a frequent occurrence. 

Rain and water has no bearing on the game at all, which is weird for a farming game, and nothing gets wet, there is no mud simulation or water visible anywhere. Just an annoying rain fall sound and nothing else. The AI traffic is profoundly stupid  and just gets in the way all the time. The helpers you can hire are almost as stupid.

It's clear that all of the effort has gone into the machinery design and implementation which is excellent (when the physics aren't flipping your tractor upside down for no reason) but this game desperately needs Unreal 5 and some serious work under the hood to beef up the physics and collision detection and the AI and the atmospherics. This game leans to heavily on a mod community adding things to the experience that should already be there, like Follow Me, innumerable building objects, Course Play and so many more.

I thought I had it, till I was left with a crater on my farm, let's start over..
It was fine till I put down the chicken coop, it rose up at least 2 meters higher than the ground, sold it but the ground stayed the same..
Now I cheated with money and put down the animals pens first, it's really frustrating when you screw up your land.. 
It's not really what I wan't but it will have to do..
And this is why I have a love hate relationship with this version.. 
Please give us (me) a undo button..
Or a map where the pens are allready in place.. I'm not a landscaper..
All in all I do love the game, even tough I'm playing for 7 hours and all I have is animal pens..

The amazing modding community also builds on an already solid foundation and adds hundreds of hours of new and interesting tweaks to the core game experience.

91,69690373,english,"What can I say about this game? So far I have logged 273 hours. Shouldn't that be enough? It seems like there is no shortage of 'things to do.' Just as soon as you get one task mastered (be it growing crops, making hay or grass bales, raising animals, whatever) you find a different way to make that task more efficient - or even find a totally different thing to do. You can end up filling up your virtual 'days' with an endless amount of farming, constantly upgrading your farming arsenal to more and more powerful machines. (And there are... I don't even know how many trucks, tractors, trailers, and machines to buy. A newbie will be a little overwhelmed by all the stuff that's available.)

The graphics are fantastic - absolutely stunning, and the attention to detail (ie. tire tracks in a freshly-plowed field) are almost unnecessarily realistic. The ambiance (dog barking in background, birds chirping, etc) is enough to lull you into a sleepy daze as you harvest the fields. (The game is not boring at all - very relaxing and VERY chill - so much so that a couple times as I have been knocking down a massive field, I have caught myself dozing off.) There's no rush at all, and no 'goal' - you plan out your day, what you want to accomplish and when, and just... work your butt off, I guess. Despite this very, very chill approach, you don't find yourself losing interest - quite the opposite, you find yourself sitting there thinking, ""Ok, after I get this field, I really need to run some loads over to the grain elevator for some extra cash, then I can get my new seeder so I can..."" etc.

You will get your moneys worth out of it if you enjoy agriculture at all or always wanted to drive tractors and harvest corn but never could IRL. The game has it's flaws, but what game doesn't. For me, the modding community makes the game, and that's the reason I continue to play. Would it be fun without all the fancy John Deere, Case, and other brands that have been modeled in 3rd party? Probably. But with this being  the 6th installment in the series, and something like GPS in tractors and combines still missing from the vanilla game lineup, it comes up a bit disappointing. I shouldn't have to rely on the modding community to provide things a farming Simulator should include. Not to mention the game engine is in need of an overhaul. The bales act the same way they did when 09 was released. And while logging was a nice touch, better be careful and don't close the grapple too tight, or you'll have 6 meter logs flying everywhere. Those are just a few negatives, there are a whole lot of positives. I play realistically, not arcade style, and some of the physics make it frustrating for me and others to really get into at times. Finesse is the key with stacking pallets or bales. And good luck having the bales stay there and not fidget about. I would REALLY like to see a toggle installed in game, or more customization for Realistic and Arcade. Tractors are not able to go up the side of a cliff, be leaning more than 45 degrees, and not roll over. Granted, it's hard for me to write a review off of ""vanilla game,"" as I haven't played that in years. As stated, the modding community keeps the game alive for me, your results may vary. I have more than gotten my money's worth out of FS19.  Will I buy the next version of the FS franchise and continue to play? Sure, we all will. Anyone who tells you they won't and has played this game in previous versions (FS17, FS 15...) is lying to you.

The game certainly has it's limitations on machinery/maps and stuff. But that can be fixed by mods. It's just unfortunate that mods are so heavily dependant on with this game. 

Overall I would still say if you're a ""Vanilla"" enthusiast give the game a try and if you want you can always add mods. 

The only two majorly bad things I have to say about the game is the AI that you can hire to help you is... buggy at the best of times. Often leaving massive areas of fields unworked. 

And the fact that this game is so heavily dependant on mods and it doesn't have a proper steam workshop like other games do. (They do have a main menu mod area but it only shows mods the developers like not all the new or ""cheaty"" or OP ones etc. )

System specs:

Intel i9-9900k overclocked to 5Ghz
ASRock Z390

Zotac GeForce RTX 2080 Ti

I think FS19 is a great game, it can provide you many hours of just average fun. Most of my hours were spent on single player saves, while I did try a bit of multiplayer it wasn't for me (details to follow). The more I play this 'game', the more I find things that are glaringly wrong with it or need massive improvements. It is clear that Giants has enjoyed years of relatively uninterupted ""farming simulator"" gaming market, while there are a few other competitors working on their own farming games, none have really been able to create a dent on Giant's undisputable control over this niche market. 

Let me start with the positives.

1) The modding community is what makes this series successful. For some reason Giants decided to spend a lot of resources on acquiring licenses and modeling more in game content, but why? The amount of time and energy players have spent bringing their own equipment into this game is insane. Sure there are some mods out there that... look like they were textured in MS paint and are really just off putting, others are extremely well done. If it weren't for mods, FS wouldn't be as nearly successful as it is. 

2) There is a decent amount of economics in the game, mostly with the help of the seasons mod. It's cool that there are a plethora of crops in the game, some more unique than others. I don't think many people do cotton, but its neat that its there. Animal management is meh, it's fun to be able to have a relatively self-sustainable operation by using manure / slurry instead of buying fertilizers. 

3) The community for the most part is pretty solid. I mostly spend my time on the FS subreddit where people exchange ideas and ask for tips / help, and I would say most people are really friendly and encouraging to new players.

4) Visual graphics have been improved in FS19 and it shows. I am able to play FS19 on maxed settings, 4k resolution at 120Hz. It isn't a ground breaking graphics improvement, but it at least feels somewhat up to date. Nothing to write home about however.

Here are the negatives.

1) Giants obsession with adding their own licensed content to the game kills other meaningful improvements that the franchise needs. As I mentioned above, modding is this games biggest strength. Thanks to mods like Seasons, vehicle realism, and global company, we're able to have more realistic aspects to FS19. I feel like the ""simulator"" part of ""Farming Simulator"" doesn't do any justice - as this feels more like an arcade mobile game now than an actual simulator. Reasons to follow.

2) Lack of soil health! If you play without seasons mod, you can plant soybeans every 'season' and enjoy absurd profit margins, rinse and repeat and you will soon find yourself burned out and not wanting to play. The implementation of weeds in FS19 was a nice intro into this area, but there still needs to be more work. Applying three layers of fertilizers or herbicide and calling your fields protected is hardly realistic and doesn't imply ""simulator"". 

3) No dynamic texturing or geometry. This might be might biggest complaint about the game. The only time fields look good is when crop is growing, but if you look at a field that you recently work (whether that is plowed, cultivated, seeded, or freshly harvested) you will notice repeated textures every few in-game units. This is very immersion breaking to me. It is just an eye sore especially with big fields! Why not at least let the textures rotate every few units so that they don't all look the same? (Easier said than done, I know). 

In addition to the horrible texturing, ground terrain needs to be able to mold and change based on a variety of impacts. I know that Giants has mentioned that they've tried experiementing with this system but if i recall correctly, they mentioned ""it doesn't work for them"" or something along those lines. I call bullshit. There are smaller studios with much smaller budgets who got dynamic ground geometry to work for them. It's the single most painful part of this franchise. What is the point of changing tires if the game doesn't take into consideration soil compaction?

4) Finances & economics, also need drastic overhauls. Forget about drawing on loans in this game, you might as well edit your farms.xml and just give yourself money there. Using the ingame loan function, you get a fixed 300% interest rate (i could be wrong about that exact percentage) and you will forever pay principal without ever paying down the loan itself. There is also no such thing as buying used equipment, and leasing is seldom worth it for large equipment (this can be dependent on what type of equipment, how long you use it for, and what you are using it for). Also, the game's price fluctuations are just ambiguous and you don't feel like you have to compete on a market. The other 'farmers' that are on the map make zero impact on prices. Seasons mod helps address this quite a bit.


Synopsis; i enjoy FS. I would probably be farming on my cousins' farm in Denmark if I wasn't allergic to everything. But I feel like this is more of an arcade game than an actual simulator.

It's a map where you start bare bones, no contracts, no neighbors and untamed wilderness.

You even have to buy some of your sell points.

The game encourages you start with a farm. I decided sell everything and go all in on a timber company to start. Busy work but excellent Cash per hour.

Considering I climbed straight from timber to corn silage I'd say it worked pretty well.

9,68650491,english,"Overall a pretty fun game, but rough around the edges. Definitely recommend playing multiplayer with someone who has experience if you haven't played previous games. 

The AI is by far my largest complaint. It can drive in a straight line and maybe turn around, but it has absolutely nothing beyond that; if two AI controlled tractors interfere with each other they simply stop and notify the player. Additionally, some of the larger sowers/planters/cultivators/etc will miss large parts of the field if your AI worker ventures anywhere near a boundary such as a road.

Other than that, it seems that running a dedicated multiplayer server requires having a second copy of the game (possibly only purchased from GIANTS website), which just makes me feel like I'm dealing with an old school software licensing company. However, you can still host from the game itself (non-dedicated) and there appears to be an option to rent dedicated servers.

Overall a tentative recommend. The price is pretty low for the amount of content, even if much of it is carried over from previous entries in the series, and the mod support really extended my enjoyment and desire to keep playing past the first 30 hours.

The equipment could be a bit more understandable to match with other equipment, etc. I just get a feel that the game relied on players already understanding the games mechanics via previous versions and the new players are just left to fend for themselves. I'm not saying the game should be easier, I get it's a simulator, but some more in depth guides in game would help, so I don't have to keep switching the screens to get the info I need that really should be available in the game to start with.

≛ Conclusion ≛
This is the most realistic farming simulator you can play. You plow, cultivate, sow, fertilize, weed, harvest, and repeat. Graphics received a big over haul and the HUD is very modern looking although the map is crappy just as FS17, the shop is farther away than Pluto is from Earth still and the placement of building is wonky. They did integrate FS17 DLCs into FS19 which is nice and they added a few new vehicle but overall this is a the most realistic and best looking simulator you're going to get.",1550982751,1588556764,True,6,3,0.522217988967895508,0,True,False,False,76561198119351059,72,15,3429,15,1580,1601133576,,

I loved every moment of it, it was basic but fun. Then I played every other game that released after it. And now we have the FS19. Firstly, it is as fun and vast as the previous games. Refreshed graphics look good but might be a bit too much for the eyes, new equipment and crops, animals... horses are a great addition to the farming world. The ability to showcase the vehicle before buying is a vital addition in my opinion, since you actually see what you want to buy. Purchasing lands directly from the pause menu also makes the game easier and more mobile. The community mods such as Straw Harvest and Seasons are the cherries on top of the cake.

There are a few irritations in my opinion. There are not enough flat surfaces to place the animal pens, and for the people with severe OCD like me, that means hell. I mess up every time I place those pens. Also, I think Giants needs to move on, since the game engine and the game as a whole feels exactly the same as it did with FS2013, which I played the most.

Apart from that, nothing more to report so far. 8.5/10. Another great FS game, but time to move on.

If you love farming sims, this game is by far the best that is out there by a long way.....however, i have been slightly annoyed by this game since fs13, firstly Giants decide that AI traffic is invincible, and not even a 10 million billion mega ton nuclear bomb can even budge them off the road. Also the weather system has remained, for the most part the same as it always has been since the early versions, and here we are still with the same old same old. Also the animals have not changed much, ok there are horses now, and the chickens have a rooster, but it makes no difference if you have a rooster or not, they still breed, but at least there is a visual male presence in the chicken coop, unlike the cows, sheep and pigs that seem to just accumulate by magic. If Giants do come out with a FS20, or FS21, then for them to stand any chance of keeping top spot for farming games, then they will need to sort those areas out. I would suggest implimenting seasons, and having a better breeding system for animals in the future versions that come out, if at all there will be any. I would recommend this game as it's always been top of the pile of games to play.

My experience is now more than 200 hours in FS19 and I have tried the most.

[u]Conclusion[/u]
All things considered, if you are in to simulation games and whatever you just like to drive a tractor or a harvester, or you like to do micro-management around running a farm, I recommend you buy Farming Simulator 19. You really get a lot for your money, not least because of the strong community around the game.

62,68190606,english,"this game has so much potential. It's such a shame that the ui is complicated, that it's riddled with bugs and that the devs clearly didn't put much thought into making a game that's easily understood, or at least playable to a new player.

The game is honestly amazing in concept- for an advanced player, the game is super realistic and really quite stunning. If you've played farmsim before then i'd recommend it, but before you buy and possibly waste money, please PLEASE understand that you'll constantly have to be consulting google and various forums to work out how to do simple tasks like using herbicide and weeding, for example. Even the core idea of selling your crops for profit has lost me. The very limited tutorial shows you the absolute basics, and without that, i wouldn't disagree with the thought that this game is next to unplayable. It took me about half an hour of actual playing to ragequit over something minor that would have taken seconds had it been explained by the game.

Altogether this is a decent game if you know what you're doing. But honestly, i'm not sure i'll keep persevering unless there's an update with some form of help guide that explains how to play the entire game. I understand people hate tutorials, but with a game this massive, it would be helpful to have one. It can be pretty buggy at points too and in the two or three days i've had this i've needed to restart from scratch as i've either been stuck somewhere or have had vehicles trapped on tools that they were supposed to be grabbing.

tldr, i'm giving it a 4/10. Difficult to use, impossible to learn, but aside from that, pretty visuals and well developed realism.",1588094649,1588094649,False,0,0,0.454545468091964722,0,True,False,False,76561198134028974,55,2,1799,0,715,1598477270,,

And ANNOYING. You want your farm to be nice and pretty looking, straight lines in rows all up and down? Good luck with that. It's hard enough to get your tractor positioned correctly to attach anything to it. You have to buy so many different tractors and pieces of equipment that it's best that you have some ACTUAL heavy equipment experience. That was one of my immediate turn offs, is that most of my first two hours was spent googling and watching tutorials. Whenever I decided to try and play without online help, I ended up buying random things that don't even work like I thought they would. No game should have you feeling this lost.

If you wanna play with your friends and they are running mods this game does not load the mods from the workshop for you and let you play like every other game in F'n creation.. That's just common sense.. You will be forced to spend hours upon hours trying to get 75+ mods with same versions etc.... And believe me there's like no one playing this without a ton of mods because well... Who would want too... They are the only thing that makes the game what it even is.... And the physics are just ridiculous... Like come on there's way more games with a WHOLE LOT more going on and they don't have these problems. I get on maps and the game cant even load in more then a 100 feet in front of me with the best PC hardware money can buy in 2020... No far away screen shots in this game..... It's actually pathetic.. Might have a shiny new paint job on graphics but that means nothing when core things are still the same... Physics are a prime example....

75,67892406,english,"I was unexpectedly surprised with this game, in a good way.  I usually play survival games and was looking for a relaxing alternative.  Most games I've played with a farming component the farming was one of the more boring parts of the game.  After watching a couple videos (and getting a good sale price) I decided to try this.  The farming in other games I've played was just part of the game and dumbed down to avoid being too time consuming.  In this game the farming is the whole point and the developer tries to make it as realistic as possible within programming and hardware restrictions.  

I would strongly urge new players to do the tutorials.  They don't cover everything but provide the major controls for the game and there are a lot of things to control.  You can drive everything from pickup trucks and small tractors to huge harvesters and large trucks.  

This isn't just a farming game, it is also a management game.  Hire workers or not?  What equipment to buy?  What crops to grow?  Want animals?  Which ones?  What do they need to be profitable?  Where to sell crops/animal products for the best price? Expand your farm or wait for more cash flow?

IT's not perfect.  There are some quirks to watch for but nothing game breaking so far at least. I installed the game did the tutorial and started the simplest game mode to get a feel for how things work in the game.  Eight hours later I decided I better get some sleep.

I'm not a big fan of mods in most games.  I see it as just a way to cheat to make the game easier.  With this game modes are almost a must but most involve different brands or types of equipment, buildings, and other maps to use.  Nothing (at least not much) that would make the game easier or remove all the challenge of playing.

There is a bit of a learning curve but if you like farming games or management games you may want to try this one.  I was pleasantly surprised.",1587670453,1587670453,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198031480865,118,9,7923,3074,1942,1602050166,,

MY ORIGINAL REVIEW \/
I feel really sad and disappointed to be writing this negative review. I was hyped for the game, pre-ordered it and put over 540 hours into FS17. I also own FS15, FS13, and FS11. I even made videos highlighting the awesome new things coming to this game. I can say I was disappointed. If these things get added or fixed, I will be happy. Until then, not impressed.

11/24/2018 This is my first adjustment to this review based on what has been happening in the last few days.

1. Mods are beginning to come out. These mods should have come with the game but they are slowly trickling in. Not all are there that are needed so you might have to wait to see that essential tool you need to play come through.
2. Still no: Greenhouses, beehouses, windmills or any real placeable that can earn passive income
3. Placing placeables where you want them is tricky and not easy at all. It becomes really frustrating especially a game that is trying to highlight it's ability to create your own farm.
4. You are able to ""create"" farm but you have very few options to pick up sheds, shelters or halls 
5. Hired hands are still bad. In fact, they are worse than 17 to which I thought they were decent with the occassional tree crashing. But now, they will leave the corners and ends of a field not harvested. 
6. Raveport is a map full of squiggly roads that seems to just make you have to drive twisty and super thin roads uphill and downhill to artifically make the game more challenging. 2nd map isn't better because it has the same issues. Roads mostly do not directly lead anywhere as you have to take mutiple turns and side roads to get anywhere useful.
7. Animal pallets like egg crates will NOT appear. I was able to get wool pallets to appear only if no equipment is in close proximity to animal pen.
8. You can't buy multiple pallets/bags of seeds. Seriously! You need to buy one by one and confirm you want to buy it instead of typing how many you want or having a drop down menu and select amount.
9. There is now a penalty for resetting/fast traveling items back to store. You fuel will GO TO almost 0 after teleporting/resetting[! You will have to fill up tank AGAIN which costs up to $300 plus. 
10. Mission reward amounts are super low vs. work and time you put into them
11. They changed the icons for the crops, hay, grass, straw etc. and they are so similar to one another and hard to decipher and they are not named in the prices window. You have to hunt for the icon legend and GO back to verify which icon is which crop they are. Hay, Grass, Straw, Silage and others are hard to tell apart.
12. The controls for the Forestry Cranes have changed and they are strange to say the least, not intuitive at all. I loved forestry and now, decided to sell all the equipment back.
13. No placeable roads to connect locations


I want to update this review in time if these things get fixed because I want to give this game a good review. But I also want to be transparent.


These are just some of the issues in the game. If these are fixed, I'll be excited to play it again. I can't believe the price is $34 and I have to wait for mods to do CORE things in the game. I understand first day bugs will happen but the game seemed more hyped up than anything.

99,67632281,english,"I bought Farming Simulator 19 on a whim during a midweek sale; I wanted a relaxing simulator and there were few games in my vast library that I knew would fit the criteria. I have little prior experience with farming sims; I played Farming Simulator 13 for around twenty hours, became frustrated with its lack of direction, and ended up dumping it because I had a technical issue that the developers didn't help with on the forum. Thus, I was a little leery of supporting this one.

78 hours of gametime later, I'm in love. Farming Simulator 19 offers you many tutorials and aids to help newcomers learn how to grow crops (of which there are different types of harvesters, sometimes extra steps, etc.) and raise animals. Sometimes it still shows lack of direction--I spent five hours on a starter map looking for the next step in the tutorial. The game wouldn't let me freeplay until finishing it, but it was missing. So I restarted on a freeplay map and figured out everything from scratch. Still, this wasn't overly stressful; the game advances at a relaxing pace to where you have plenty of time to prepare for the next venture (new field, new equipment, new crop/animal, etc.) and research its requirements online. Trial and error is to be expected. Early on, I almost ran out of money because a new field I bought already had sugar beets planted, so I decided to lease all corresponding equipment to harvest it since I couldn't afford to buy it. Leasing everything cost me $23K when the harvest granted $26K in profit. Thankfully all was well, but had I any idea how complicated it would be beforehand, I would have waited for the AI to harvest it before purchasing the lot. The game doesn't warn you when you're about to make stupid decisions, so with each major purchase, you need to do a lot of research!

In fact, Farming Simulator 19 never tells you what to do. It is a true simulation that allows you every freedom. Everything is customizable, even a lot of crucial game options. You can choose whether or not your equipment gets visibly dirty, weeds grow with every harvest, lime and/or periodic plowing is required to maintain yield, and you can even quicken or slow down time. This last point is my favorite because it allows you to play the game at any pace you want, from where 24 hours passes in 12 minutes (120x speed) to where it's based on real-time, so each in-game minute is one real-life minute. I'd often play in real-time until all my chores on my land were done, then do missions from other farmers to make money until there were no more jobs I wanted to do (Hint: harvesting jobs make the best profit, for you get the job money and a percentage of the harvest income). Then, ""fast forward"" until other fields develop, do more missions, etc. In this way, you can manipulate the world to where you can maximize the amount of money you make in a day to further protect you from bankruptcy. Because you can hire helpers to do many jobs for you, you can focus on doing those you like best (say, harvesting) while getting the AI to do the others. All of these jobs can be happening simultaneously. As long as you have the equipment and time, you can be working the land all over the map at once with aid from workers.

I grew up on a ranch, and out of all the pets I've ever had (more than two dozen species), chickens were by far the most fun. Farming Simulator 19 is one of the few games that allows me to experience just a bit of that joy as an adult living in the suburbs, and I'm grateful to it. You can also raise horses, sheep, cows, and pigs, though you can only name horses. I would have loved the option to name all animals to give it a more personal touch. Additionally, I hope in the future Giants Software considers building upon the helper system. It's great to have helpers, but they don't have names and aren't hired for good. I think it'd be nice for Farming Simulator to go the way of SCS Software's Truck Simulator series (Euro and American), to where you could hire and manage actual employees, even assigning certain jobs for them to do automatically. The only other request I'd have is for more crops and corresponding equipment. I'd love to tend to orchards or even just grow something more exciting than the roster of grains (and few others like potatoes, sugar beets).

In summary, Farming Simulator 19 is a perfect gateway into farming sims for players looking to start. You can play your way: actively, by tending to every task yourself and fast-forwarding through growth phases, or passively, by assigning AI to tasks and slowing time down to a crawl. If you love tending to and building a business in a relaxing atmosphere, Farming Simulator 19 is one of the few games that captures that unique feeling. This game sits next to those in the Truck Simulator franchise as one of my go-to relaxing simulators. I look forward to seeing Giants Software continue to innovate and grow the series.",1587309405,1587309405,True,1,0,0.494799375534057617,0,True,False,False,76561198072532782,73,32,2143,0,2143,1581283301,,

I was not impressed by the wheel and pedal support (no force feedback and poor control mapping), however I had quite a bit of fun with the game itself. It has a special appeal with friends to get in there and just get some farming done. The map we played on was neat, with a bunch of little easter eggs and was fun to bomb around in our trucks and explore. I do feel, however, that a lot of obvious features are missing from the game, some that are added via mods, however I almost feel like the developers lean on the modding community a little bit too much. I don't really know anything about farming outside of experience with this game, so the DLC doesn't really mean much to me but it seems a little overpriced.

It has certainly improved, but the maps aren't very fun, and not enough has been improved from 17 for this to be a true standalone evolution of the series in my opinion. However, with mods, this game is makes 17 obsolete as Seasons is vastly more intricate, and my favorite maps from 17, including goldcrest valley and lone oak farm are now available as official mods. So, thanks to the modding community alone, this is a rival to 17. Without mods, 17 was much better. I played 17 for almost 600 hours before I modded the game. 




Original: 
This is the most disappointing release this year.  Id rather take the money I paid the devs, and give it directly to the modders whom are being relied upon by giants to make the game playable. There are too many bugs for a full release, the maps are awful, the new features aren't done very well, or are pointless. No seasons, missing important equipment, rain still goes through buildings, and the build your own farm feature is trash. I'm upset with myself for playing this alpha for over 2 hours as I cant refund it.

90,47504317,english,"Pro (Enhancements over 2017):
-Cotton
-Oats
-Dog
-Horses
-Field birds
-Landscape editor
-Slightly better graphics
-Buy land instead of fields
-More realistic steering (overall better. Steering for the wheel loader is superior, but steering for conveyor is bad)

Con:
-Slightly more buggy
-No longer have in game vehicle sales events
-The landscape editor breaks game immersion
-Chainsaw does not work as well as 2017 for cutting branches
-No reputation system. In 2017, if you did tasks for a farmer, then you could get a better price for their land.
-Train is less useful. Train automatically runs around the tracks, thus have to constantly move it back to where it is needed. You must be in the train for loading and unloading -- if you exit, then the operation will stop. 
-Still uses magic seeds instead of crop specific seeds.
-Giants editor is more complicated -- may discourage mod creation.

Overall better than Farming Simulator 2017, but you are loosing some 2017 features (vehicle sales, a reputation system, better trains).",1544712701,1586125756,True,2,0,0.502544522285461426,0,True,False,False,76561198032589379,86,10,3082,15,431,1601507688,,

The loop of planting->fertilizing->harvesting over and over to buy new machines and land is a great game base in my opinion.

Now onto some of the downsides. There is one big issue I have with farming sim, and I hope they fix it in later releases. Graphics. This game's graphics look like their from 2015. The render distance is also bad, as even just barely zoomed out you can see the circle around you of what has been processed. I really hope that Giant takes their time with the next game, and improves the graphics. While this is annoying, I can look past it given the game is fun, and I enjoy it.

I am seriously reconsidering paying for the next issue of this game, as it will only get worse with all the ""improvements"".  the only good thing here so far is landscaping to even out the dimples in the fields and hills surounding them, and as 1 of the players who like to play at real time speed and thrue the night, its too dark at nights , i put on max brightness seting for the game and it does baerly any difference to visibility, added the max brighness on screen setting and also very little use.  in FS17 I used to be be able to change brighness to max and instantly be able to see the edges of my equepment and the field texture for cultivated/ non etc. this ligh changes are unplasent for me as I like to play thru the night not just skipp it becouce the  headlighs from the tractor only give me a meter of visibility and then complete darkness, realisim setting needs to be adjustable in the menu, realism is one thing but if less people have fun in game, there will be less followers.",1585389748,1585390412,False,2,1,0.475047975778579712,0,True,True,False,76561198031833848,41,8,29618,0,5808,1596292677,,

difficult somehow. First of all the game lacks information by a lot, I understand part of the fun is to figure out how the machines work and how to use them, but I don't understand the point of not having any information at all and having to dig out everything from google. Secondly the game play I consider to be one of the worst experiences I have ever had in a game, most of game is driving around and handling machines, transporting stuff with trailers is just ridiculous, I see no point on getting stuck with the trailer on a postbox or a electric pole, or to loose visibility of the vehicle because trees are everywhere. Driving vehicles on the cockpit is unplayable and impossible to handle with a trailer, there wasn't any attention to gameplay when this was developed and no improvements after release either.
My main note is, could be a very fun game to play if they had put more time into making the gameplay better and also if devs had spent more time putting information available. Also the game is still quite buggy at this stage.

5,65570641,english,"I bought Farming Simulator 19 on a whim during a midweek sale; I wanted a relaxing simulator and there were few games in my vast library that I knew would fit the criteria. I have little prior experience with farming sims; I played Farming Simulator 13 for around twenty hours, became frustrated with its lack of direction, and ended up dumping it because I had a technical issue that the developers didn't help with on the forum. Thus, I was a little leery of supporting this one.

78 hours of gametime later, I'm in love. Farming Simulator 19 offers you many tutorials and aids to help newcomers learn how to grow crops (of which there are different types of harvesters, sometimes extra steps, etc.) and raise animals. Sometimes it still shows lack of direction--I spent five hours on a starter map looking for the next step in the tutorial. The game wouldn't let me freeplay until finishing it, but it was missing. So I restarted on a freeplay map and figured out everything from scratch. Still, this wasn't overly stressful; the game advances at a relaxing pace to where you have plenty of time to prepare for the next venture (new field, new equipment, new crop/animal, etc.) and research its requirements online. Trial and error is to be expected. Early on, I almost ran out of money because a new field I bought already had sugar beets planted, so I decided to lease all corresponding equipment to harvest it since I couldn't afford to buy it. Leasing everything cost me $23K when the harvest granted $26K in profit. Thankfully all was well, but had I any idea how complicated it would be beforehand, I would have waited for the AI to harvest it before purchasing the lot. The game doesn't warn you when you're about to make stupid decisions, so with each major purchase, you need to do a lot of research!

In fact, Farming Simulator 19 [i]never[/i] tells you what to do. It is a true simulation that allows you every freedom. Everything is customizable, even a lot of crucial game options. You can choose whether or not your equipment gets visibly dirty, weeds grow with every harvest, lime and/or periodic plowing is required to maintain yield, and you can even quicken or slow down time. This last point is my favorite because it allows you to play the game at any pace you want, from where 24 hours passes in 12 minutes (120x speed) to where it's based on real-time, so each in-game minute is one real-life minute. I'd often play in real-time until all my chores on my land were done, then do missions from other farmers to make money until there were no more jobs I wanted to do (Hint: harvesting jobs make the best profit, for you get the job money and a percentage of the harvest income). Then, ""fast forward"" until other fields develop, do more missions, etc. In this way, you can manipulate the world to where you can maximize the amount of money you make in a day to further protect you from bankruptcy. Because you can hire helpers to do many jobs for you, you can focus on doing those you like best (say, harvesting) while getting the AI to do the others. All of these jobs can be happening simultaneously. As long as you have the equipment and time, you can be working the land all over the map at once with aid from workers.

I grew up on a ranch, and out of all the pets I've ever had (more than two dozen species), chickens were by far the most fun. Farming Simulator 19 is one of the few games that allows me to experience just a bit of that joy as an adult living in the suburbs, and I'm grateful to it. You can also raise horses, sheep, cows, and pigs, though you can only name horses. I would have loved the option to name all animals to give it a more personal touch. Additionally, I hope in the future Giants Software considers building upon the helper system. It's great to have helpers, but they don't have names and aren't hired for good. I think it'd be nice for Farming Simulator to go the way of SCS Software's Truck Simulator series (Euro and American), to where you could hire and manage actual employees, even assigning certain jobs for them to do automatically. The only other request I'd have is for more crops and corresponding equipment. I'd love to tend to orchards or even just grow something more exciting than the roster of grains (and few others like potatoes, sugar beets).

In summary, Farming Simulator 19 is a perfect gateway into farming sims for players looking to start. You can play your way: actively, by tending to every task yourself and fast-forwarding through growth phases, or passively, by assigning AI to tasks and slowing time down to a crawl. If you love tending to and building a business in a relaxing atmosphere, Farming Simulator 19 is one of the few games that captures that unique feeling. This game sits next to those in the Truck Simulator franchise as one of my go-to relaxing simulators. I look forward to seeing Giants Software continue to innovate and grow the series.",1584900616,1584900616,True,57,6,0.816519498825073242,0,True,False,False,76561198124275446,1632,57,4696,0,4696,1584583693,,

The game have som fundemental buggs tho, that you'd expect such a title to be free of. Like object interacting with you'r equipment, or scenery bugs that cant be handled with the scenery tool.
- picking up a pallet with the forklift, can at times be very glitchy and if  it is, you better puttit down quickly before the pallet rocket's-off in to the distance for no apparent reason. (its a freaquent bug!)

- Scenery, how about ironing out that bump in your field, or just outside you'r porch? Nope, sorry that terrain in the middle of nowhere is locked in place, and cant be edited. but you can do whatever you like whit everything around it! (Makes sense right?)

[ If you want to look at the bugs in action, i recomend looking up Colonell Failure on youtube and he'll tell you about the bugs in about every video. ]

Id say the level of bugs in this game could compare to an early alpha-game at times. But I'm still going to recomend the game, its good and have alot of immersive gameplay, good moddel details and with some addons, who are less buggy than the base game, This game goes a long way in beeing Awesome

48,64929896,english,"EDIT: I've added some things that I find annoying about this game that really detract from its value. Please take that into consideration.

I've been a ""fan"" of the farming sim genre for a while now. I got really hooked on Farm Simulator 2013 -- I probably put 200 hours into that game, which was way more than I anticipated.  I tried again with '14, '15, '17 and now '19 but so far nothing has recaptured that feel for me yet. 

I'm not even into the game that far yet, but I can recognize they've added a bunch of options and made it much more customizable. For one thing, you have a lot of options for crops to raise.  Back in '13 it was wheat, barley, canola, corn, potatos, and beets, and oh yeah, you could just let the fields grow grass and cut that for hay bales.  This game has a lot more options for crops -- 13 different crops including grain, root crops (potatoes etc), cotton, sugarcane, and sunflowers.

There's also a lumber side-gig you can do where you chop trees down (with machinery) to sell to a lumber yard.  I don't know if that's really going to be something I'll want to do since to me the idea of waiting for a tree to grow so I can cut it down and sell it for profit sounds like a boring job.  If you're talking about a forest then it's different.

The types of animals you can have has also increased from just ""Chickens, sheep, and cows"" in '13 to chickens, cows, horses, pigs, and sheep, as well as additions to you can do with them.  Before it was just eggs, milk and wool... oh and manure for slurry/fertilizing.   I don't yet know if this is a good change, and as I figure it out I'll edit this review. 

Of course they've added a bunch of different machinery types, so you can feel all manly driving a multitude of different tractors and other vehicles, but they also gave you options for buying vs leasing (which is actually more like renting).  If there's a vehicle you only need rarely, you could just lease it and then return it when you're done instead of spending the large amount of cash for something you barely use.

Another change is that they've added the ability to buy and place your own farmhouse.  In the original game you had one farmhouse with a small nearby field, and then you slowly bought up all the other land plots around you to increase your farm's size.  Now you could potentially buy/build a new house for every field if you wanted. 

There's also mods supported much like every Farm sim game ever (at least as far as I know) and you can play this online with friends.  In fact I'd go as far as to say that playing it online is probably the best way to go, since offline single-player feels like you're the only person in town.  There are AI cars that drive around, but they really don't do anything more than provide scenery and obstacles for you as you drive from point A to point B.

Unlike older games in the series, there's very little online documentation about this game unless you like watching youtube videos that take 26 minutes to get to the point you're wondering about.  I prefer a nice manual or at the bare minimum, a wiki that I can consult for help.  The in-game help is just about useless by telling you almost nothing about each category, so without a wiki or a manual you're going to be running to the steam forums to find the answers.  The really bad thing is that nobody finds out the answers without a lot of trial and error and in some cases, LOTS of errors.  How hard is it to make a dang manual Giants?

The older games also had some kind of extra side-quest type stuff that encouraged you to fully explore the map.  In 2013 there was a bunch of horseshoes littering the countryside (but no horses strangely enough) and if you found enough horseshoes it would trigger an event.  One of the later games (2015 maybe?) had you looking for actual gold bars lying around.  I had an easier time believing that someone might leave horseshoes lying around, but both served the same purpose: find them for an achievement and maybe to trigger some event.  So far as I can tell in 2019 this doesn't happen.   

It was kind of a pointless easter egg hunt in the earlier games so maybe they decided that few people really cared about it and removed it.  I liked it because it gave me a reason to wander around the map on foot while I waited for my crops to grow.   I could easily have just cranked the time compression up to max and then back down to real-time to harvest, but that was equally boring since I just wound up staying there watching the crops grow.  

Overall though, I don't find this game as interesting as the first game I played.  I don't know if that's because I already burned out on the idea of being a video game farmer, or if it's just that the game mechanics are kinda dry and repetitive.  This is a game I'd give a ""meh"" thumb to if I could.   It's not worth investing hundreds of hours into without friends who are also into the game, but it's not so terrible that I'd warn someone off of it entirely.

I'm starting to think at this point that you'd be better off getting FS 2017 and then modding it up to 2019 standards.  I've had the game crash on me a couple of times out of nowhere (just randomly as far as I can tell. I can't reproduce the error anyway) and I've purchased an item that sells in the store as a planter only to find out it can only be loaded with dry fertilizer).  

My advice would be to try one of the earlier incarnations of this game that are much simpler in scope like Farm Simulator 2013, and if you like that one, you might also want this one for the expanded options.  The thumbs up is basically because I don't hate it...but I haven't really yet come to love it either.  Your mileage may vary.  If you enjoy building your own farm and paying back a loan then maybe you'll find it engaging enough -- That was one of the original aspects of the game that I enjoyed.",1584045106,1584725952,True,39,3,0.757512509822845459,0,True,False,False,76561197969913402,2698,188,1444,0,478,1584733275,,

For example, you dont need to worry about 100 different types of seed or fertilizer or super detailed soil management. You just get a cultivator or a sower and you drive across the field. One MAJOR pro is that modding is REAL. Like Skyrim levels of real. There is so many mods, even those supported by GIANTS themselves. Modding is what makes farm sim games great in general. And its all free! There are few DLC's if you want to buy them as they are quite nice but not necessary at all as you can get similar things from mods altho official models tend to be of higher quality.

The devs have stripped content out, greenhouses are gone, passive income buildings such as solar panels and wind turbines have gone. Granted these things don't necessarily make the game, but they were nice to have.

The modding community added to FS17 what the developers have missed, and clearly they have not learned from this, as a lot of these things still have not been added to the game.

My biggest irritation is that forklifts still operate as if the forks have grease on them and the objects have zero mass to them, after several attempts to try and load a pallet I was ready to give the game up there and then. I didn't even get on to logging but have been informed it as still as frustrating to try and move things about as it was in 17.

To me, the devs have just took FS17, upped the graphics slightly, made a new map, and added some mediocre extra content, like adding lime to fields, and released it.

The raw emotion pivoting his face as he drunkenly beats my mother into another realm in which i can not idealize. ""daddy! why must you abuse mother in such a harmful manner?"" I say in a quivering tone... ""Johnny get your ass here boy, do not talk to me that way you sonabitch!"" *furiously whips Johnnys rib cage with his bare fist*. ""papa!.... please! wont you spare me another day?!"" and then he left, never to be seen again. After first contact with this Life-Changing experience, my life has been saved, and i have yet to see another day with such hatred.

Modifications:
You name it, chances are, there's a mod for it- that is- if it's not already in the game. These mods include everything from machinery, to maps, and the game mechanics themselves. They're easy to install thanks to an accessible folder that comes DEFAULT with the game. There are plenty of websites to get mods on, and even a mod hub in the game itself. 

Experience:
The Farming Simulator franchise has been around for a while. They know what they are doing. With many DLC for purchase, and the default vehicles and mechanics, you are getting a lot of bang for your buck. 

Multiplayer:
Go out and run a farm with your friends! They make it easy and fun for you to do this, and there's always plenty of people online.

Joystick Compatibility:
Do you have 2 joysticks, a steering wheel, and a pedal that you want to use with this game? Use them all at the same time and customize all the controls with ease.

50,49354192,english,"I think this is the first Farming Simulator that I don't recommend. I keep the right to change my opinion once I invest a couple of hundred hours into it... Let's wait and see.

[h1]So - why ""Not recommended""?[/h1]

Once again, Giants have just re-packaged their game. This is FS17 with two new maps, a bit re-shaded graphics and minimal gameplay enhancements. Add a few FS17 DLCs into the base game and you get FS19.

Yes, it looks nicer than FS17 if you have the graphics set to max, but my i7 7700/GTX1060 laptop can't handle them. So, to get the smooth FPS, I have to play on mid settings - and they look horrible. Way worse than FS17.

Price is also over the top (for what they are offering). Giants are just milking this cash-cow at the moment. Buy yourself FS17 or some DLCs for it - way better value for money.

I already felt cheated when I bought FS17, but now I'm just dissapointed. This is the last time I buy the actual FS. From now on, I'll just play the one that's a generation old.

[h1]Edit 1 @ 33 hours:[/h1]
I'm not sure what grass Giants were consuming when they wrote the minimum specs - 4GB RAM. ??? It seems this game is a memory hog; I could barely run mid settings with 8GB. I have now upgraded to 16GB, and am delighted to report that I can run the game on High settings. (Still, nothing to write home about... it still feels like FS17 with a bit of a shader applied.) I still think you should save your money and play FS17.

[h1]Edit 2 @ 470 hours:[/h1]
Well, yeah, I'm playing it seeing that I already own it. Since my last edit, there was a couple of DLC releases... Only one worth the money though - the John Deere DLC.

Some of the DLC's (Platnium Expansion) did not add any additional features to the gameplay; all it added was more equipment and its prices at $20.  
This game needed more refinements before it should have been released but for the most part they have been flushed out.  Some of the game representatives have also been less than par (to put it mildly) with their attitudes with us.  I do believe that this company could stand to go back to and take some customer service refresher classes.

The game is in an O.K. state now but Giants reputation with me has been severely damaged with me and I have lost a lot of faith in them for producing a knockout game.

Raring, tearing, losing, winning
O hit the diff and pray
That she goes all the way
When am flat to the mat
With the party hats
Am heading for the tea
They thought that we where quitting
Well, when the sun went down
With a flame from the pipe
We drove all night
To the fuel it ran out
O give me a yoke
With plenty of poke
And a can of easy start
And 1500 acres
Hauling 40 tonne of grass
I said goodbye before July
To the woman in an awful rush
And it was near Christmas
Before I got back in touch
I found a sate
But I had no brakes
Couldn't keep it cool
With loads of power
I was behind an hour
So I give them pump a screw
Out all night
With no lights
Only seeing stars
And the gloom from the moon
And the diesel light in the dash
Mowing, lifting, sowing, baling
Drawing, hauling and buckraking
Backing, stacking, plowing, crashing

Well, when the sun went down

Over load on
On a downhill road
Slapping trough the gears
Sending Snapchats
Of what am at
To every one on the beer
Hit the dual to low
And I started to roll
All wheels in the air
It was my chance
To grease the nipples
I never knew was there
Need some sleep
And new teeth
For digging and
Dozing in muck
In case it rains
Need an owl chain
Lying in the truck
Climbing, liming
Mixing, piping
After the field is cut
There's manys a gap
You won't get at
With out 6, 000 foot
Mowing, lifting, sowing, baling

I drive trucks IRL, and I use weigh scales alot! I also like to use them in this game too, but with Giants script, those scales just make me first laugh rolling on the floor, and then cry my eyes out of my head for being so angry. How can Giants idiots be so damn idiot, they can't fix this little annoying thing?!?
For example... I drive 18.6 ton tracktor with loaded water barrel n the scale, and it says it weighs 29 tons... WTF!?!?
Giants scrip for weigh station is: TOTAL WEIGHT + ALL THE ATTACHED IMPLEMENTS AND CARGO TWICE!
They are soooo fucking smart at Giants they can't even do a simple math...
I'm glad there is one weigh station mod buy GTX, which is WORKING as it should. :) You just have to use editor by yourself, to make those maps playable, which use Giants script for weigh scaling...
GIANTS!!! FIX THIS ALREADY!!!!
There is even more to fix, but that's just one example... And now they even try to get votes for Steam awards. So lame. This game is NOTHING without modders and mods which has made this game playable. Giants hasn't done nothing. Except asking more money for lame dlc's... Don't buy! Don't vote!

EDIT...

YES!!! I can give even more money to Giants - New crappy DLC coming!!! (Did not buy last dlc, will not buy this one) And still they can't even fix their weight scaling problem, which is VERY annoying. Fucking idiots asking money, but produce shit...
Are you complete blind there?!?!? Fix THE GAME first, then release your shitty mods as dlc's... If someone actually pays for these... well... makes me smile a bit :D :D :D",1577454086,1582210117,False,0,1,0,1,True,False,False,76561198087503024,23,2,49475,132,37449,1601413687,,

FS19 is the ONLY modern multiplayer game that I have ever played that doesn't even support playing over LAN. On top of this, the expectation is that for a dedicated server, you either have to buy another copy of the game for hosting purposes, or you use an official server and pay a monthly fee. What kind of garbage business model is that? I even tried searching Google for help setting up multiplayer and even though my search terms were innocuous, about half of the results were piracy and game cracking sites. Wtf. Though, I suppose now I understand why.

If you only want to go for the singleplayer, I suppose it's a good game. However, do your research before attempting multiplayer, and if it doesn't seem worth the trouble, don't bother wasting your money.

But then they completely ruin the game by having a very poor worker system. You can only hire workers when you are at the field of choice. Which is nice. EXCEPT! because of this you pretty much just spend hours driving the tractors back and forth or your trucks back and forth to sell your grain. They really need to implement a system where you can manage the game without personally driving, so maybe like workers can drive to fields and stores, and your grain can be sold on farm at a reduced price instead of having to transport it everytime. And because they dont have this the entire game is pretty much just driving around tractors which gets boring after a few hours. The real fun comes into managing your farm, making money and growing your business. But its impossible to do so when you gotta focus all your efforts on driving the tractors to each crop or sell point.

Then FS19 came out and I noticed it was on console. But I still didn't bite. Finally at $14.99 I bought the game.

Here's the thing. European developers are really good at niche sim games, and this one is right up there with Euro Truck Simulator 2. The game is hard, but once you start to get the hang of it, it kinda creates a vacuum. My first 5 save files went bankrupt because I had no idea what I was doing, and the tutorials will do little to help if you don't understand basic farming.

The single player aspect is what I love about the game with the occasional multiplayer experience.  That being said, this is where the game is lacking heavily.  

Without fundamental AI improvements, and in Single player being able to become a ""farm manager"" of sorts, its basically worthless to try and have a farm of more than 5 or so fields to work.  It becomes IMPOSSIBLE to manage a farm of any large scale due to a crushing AI experience.  The workers do function better in 19 than any other series, however to have the ability to park them in a shed and say 'Go to field 19 and do...x, y, z"" would seriously enhance the single player experience.  

Until this is done, this will be my last Farming Simulator game.  It becomes extremely tedious and redundant.

Multiplayer is hit and miss, which can be a blast with the right people.  However there are a lot of trolls in the game and they just try to break the farms.  Or you feel like you're doing all sorts of work for someone else.

80,62301785,english,"Many, MANY hours on this game. I've also played FS17, and 15. All wonderful games, and I love how each title (although fairly expensive) is basically just an update to the same ""platform."" All of them use the same basic build, and everything (GUI, physics, etc.) is all relatively the similar. However, Farming Simulator 19 has definitely been the best. Amazing graphics, easy to use menus, and relatively simple, straight forward gameplay. Only a few things I can say other than amazing. Lacks a realistic transmission setup with gearing, which is really only an issue if you're extremely into detail. Other biggest issue for me personally (maybe others) is that, as I said, it's an extremely basic game without mods. Farming is it. Until you get mods. Mods are nearly required for this game, especially if you're into that kind of thing. Lastly, if you have too many things (machines, tractors, cars..) it lags BAD, which is to be expected, and can only be fixed through better PC specs (so fair warning). Other than that, wonderful game.

I've put well over 500 hours into FS19 between both of my systems (I play what I want, where I want, when I want) and I'll keep it in my regular game rotation until FS21 comes out.
I love the fact that I can get lost in a map. Working the fields, taking care of the animals, playing around with some amazing machinery...it seems slow paced, but your list of things to do is never ending and the day is over (in game and IRL) before you realize it. 
I've even done research to figure out what some of the things in game are, how they're used and when they're used. I grew up in a rural farming area, never really caring what the farmers are up to. Nowadays, while visiting, I'm trying to see what tractors and implements they're using.

-Still never fixes bugs.
-rely on mods (should not replace the game as a hole)
-high priced DLCs with no update
-more a kids game than a ""simulation""
-Dare to ask for a labor of love steam reward
-staff that dosen't listen to his player

HOWEVER.
this game gave me lots of gametime with online and the mods.
enjoy the game even with bug (dosen't brake the experience as much)
The idea is great and nicely executed in a sence
Looks great
the community is great

I would still recommend fs 17 over this version though. it gave me more fun and cost me less.

80,47095828,english,"2020-01-17 REVIEW:
A lot better than it was at release, but still lacks basic quality of life improvements. My last straw: I accidentally swiped with the landscaping tool and no undo option is available. When I opened the menu to quit, the game auto-saved. I deleted the save game then uninstalled FS19.


OLD REVIEW:
This game is buggier than I would have hoped for from a big studio release.


1 - When trying to unload a harvester into a trailer, it doesn't recognize the main body as a dump zone, but might catch the very edge of the truck as acceptable. The result is it's very hard to unload, and if it does, it's unloading outside of the trailer.

2 - I just accepted 3 missions, leasing the equipment. A popup shows up saying that the equipment at the store. The equipment is not at the store, and I don't have any missions. I just accepted three in a row (you can only have one at a time).

3 - I drove over a train safety railing and got stuck. After the train passed, the railing lifted the harvester into the air. Quite unrealistic. I had to use a trailer to ram it down.

4 - The lighting is very flickery, even on my 1080 Titan,

5 - ""Helper B has stopped unexpectedly - for an unknown reason"" - Reason: Invisisble rocks on fairly flat ground between fields 25 and 26

6 - ""Icons - Part 2"" in the help doesn't have a #5, but instead shows #9 twice.

7 - The game should be called ""Transport & Delivery Simulator 2019"". I can hire workers for the farming tasks, but not for driving/transport/delivery. Therefore, I spend the vast majority of my time driving, not farming. I don't care for this. I wish it was like the mobile 2018 game, where I can order a vehicle to drive to B, or unload and return from site C, or auto-refill tanks, etc.

8 - I want the camera position to be remembered between play sessions, not just between vehicle cycles. As it is, I have to start every game session with gobs of scrolling out. This will only get more and more tedious with the more vehicles I purchase.

9 - The vehicles are super bouncy. It's very easy to tip them over. I recently spent a half hour getting a mission-leased semi unstuck from a tree by ramming it with a tractor, which itself flipped over twice in the process. This, combined with driving from A to B, was the vast majority of my play tonight. No bueno. I'd love a simply ""Flip me right-side up"" button.
9.1 - Update: It's getting very frustrating, during my forced transports (no auto-pilot), I'll bump a tree, or a sign, or a trash can, or a car, or a rock, and my tractor and trailor flip. Then I have to spend the next 15 mins+ getting another tractor there to ram me right side up (which did 5 mid-air barrel rolls before getting flipped itself after taking a sharp turn). This is a transport and tractor flipping game. I do very little farming. I am aware I can ""Reset"" tractors from the map, however, you penalize me hundreds (if not thousands) in cargo/fuel. That is unnecessary and uncalled for. Very frsutrating.

10 - I wish all of the icons would say what they are when I mouse over them.

11 - Looking at my Owned Items in the Garage, I expect the pictures to look like the tractor I have, not the stock, unmodified tractor (ie. one of my tractors has 8 wheels, but the photo of it in my garage only has 4)

12 - Again in the Garage, I'd love to see the tractors/vehicles coupled with the accessories/trailors they have currently equiped. This'd help me identify which one of many I am looking at, as well as which accessory. For example, if I want to sell one front-weight, which of my dozen do I need to sell? Or, which of my 8 green tractors is the one I want to identify?

13 - Why can't I use a helper to fertilize or lime?

14 - I'd like to have am/pm times for the clock. Not just military time.

15 - Let me sleep during the day. The only purpose of the house, otherwise, is to speed time only at night, which makes it much more tempting to just sell the house and pocket 175k.

16 - Can we get a x240, or even a x480, time speed? When I've nothing to do but watch as crops go from planted to grown, it still takes quite a while, even on x120.

17 - If I run into a car with my tractor/trailor, I go flying, and the car doesn't budge. I should be able to shove them out of the way...

18 - Why don't you post patch notes? I believe you've updated a few times since launch, yet no patch notes. Without knowing what you've fixed, I'm forced to assume nothing. Not communicating didn't work out for No Man's Sky...

I'm sure I'll run into more issues, and I hope Giants fixes these release bugs asap.",1543284506,1579322248,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198065599965,73,12,4376,0,1259,1579322033,,

Same goes for the animations, interface and  general mechanics, they just look totally amatorial to me, I don't know, I guess if it would be an indie game that would be great, but for a franchise that is on the market since forever instead, FS19 still has a very sloppy feeling.

The only detailed and professional level thing in the game are the machines and farming tools in general, which sure, are very important, since is a farming simulator, but if all the rest feels 10 years old, is like driving a Ferrari in a ghetto.

Besides, I had way more fun with FS17, it probably felt more user friendly, even if you are not a professional farmer I mean.

Game was to raw for that time, I noticed some bugs for example ""the harvester New Holland CR 10.90 stuck for example on the field number 12 on the map Felsbrunn, because it's header falls too low and clings to the soil and the harvester can not go"". Developers fixed this one, one ""+"" to them. So, I was playing this game for one year and noticed some bugs more. 
1. I know that it is ""optimization"" but shadows behave really wierd (I'll leave some screenshots). 
2. Not a bug but it's really annoying, NPC cars... They're stony and very primitive, without them every map looks abandoned but when they are ""on"" they can really be a interference, they stop only when they almost touch you, you can't move them coz they are stony. I really want smart NPCs will be in FS21 to they can give you pass through, to they are not stony (like in ETS2 you can move them when you hit them but pay for it a fine), one ""-"" to devs. 
3. Next disadvantage it's glitchy forestry process, when you load logs with manipulator, they (logs) can suddenly fall in epilepsy seizure (I'll leave link to video in youtube to prove my words), in FS17 everything was OK with forestry process. 
4. Next issue it's shimmering elements of controls of technical equipment, this issue exist in FS17 for example in ""Stara Imperador 3.0"" arrows on joystick shimmer and one tiny element shimmers in FS19 too, it didn't in FS17, second ""-"" to devs. What more that besides arrows on controls mirrors in some tractors shimmer too now in FS19 (I'll leave a link to video). But now let's speak about good side of this game. FS19 much better than FS17, graphics improved, gameplay improved, physics improved with some issues described above but improved anyway. I really love FS games, I just constructively pointed out the shortcomings. So steam doesn't have ""neutral"" review button so I'll recommend this game if you can close your eyes to this little issues. But if you can't live without good graphics and you love to find fault with little details and everything should be almost perfect I won't recommend this game.

The next game is likely to come out in 2020 so it's probably a bit late to buy this one, but if you want a Farming sim right now then this is still the best one to get.

This game is 1) not a new game, it's the same one, and 2) it's a buggy mess. They had many chances to fix what this game is lacking the most: realistic physics. I'm really tired of having tractors, enormous trees and huge f-ing harvesters bounce around the map like beach balls. Implement gravity! I admit it's fun to leap 50 meters with by 20 ton truck while driving over a bump, but that's not how gravity works. Items in the real world have weight, see. This has been broken for 3 games now, because it's the same game engine.

Then there are so many small bugs that continuously breaks things from being enjoyable. Like, they finally fixed it so that you can't drive over your crops. But you must remove weeds from them, so then you have to drive over them and destroy them. Or you can hire a helper who magically doesn't destroy them. Hot keys for machines suddenly disappear randomly: no straw swatch on the harvester, no seed option on the seeder etc. The option is still there, but the hotkey is gone.

I google some of these bugs and find that they have been unresolved since 2015. Pathetic.

It's a very good game under all bugs, but it's THE SAME GAME AS FS 2015. With far more bugs. Don't buy this mess, don't buy any FS until they get a new game engine.

I expect glitches and functionality problems with modded vehicles and maps, but when the default maps and vehicles don't work consistently together, it's just pure frustration.  Example:  I purchased a field (18, I think), which had a crop of corn growing in it.  I tried at least three different harvesters, with three different corn headers, and every one of them got stuck at starting edge of the field.    I started a new game on a modded map, saved it at least 6 times while playing, and then I had to do a forced reboot, and when I went back in, my saved game was gone.

However the game comes into its own and really shines through the addition of mods (which are very easy to install). The mods on offer are fantastic at really extending that real farm feel, from vehicles to buildings and other dynamics. 

I highly recommend Seasons and a couple of choice maps like Loan Oak and This is Ireland to really get the full Farming Sim 19 experience. 

The you'll have to get yer famer on, plan sowing and harvests, care for your animals properly and decided how you're really going to run your farm and its hugely rewarding.

38,60599028,english,"As a long time video gamer, this one stacks up there nice in the simulator world. Having just passed the 1900 hour mark, I will state that I have played about every situation available on this but the arcade style sim league. Not a fan of that, but to each their own. The maps that come with this game are real fun to play, or tack on some mod maps and see how you can do. I have a few game saves running. One I play from scratch and the other one I did the money cheat. Seasons mod really adds the realism one would expect as a real dirt warrior. 

The graphics are fantastic on my PC's. I utilize twin 1080 GTI cards from 2017. That said, some of the glitches in the programming make the game a bit quirky, as in the dairy cows walking right through your character.  If you can put that all aside, then game on, because this is pure fun. The addition of horses is a great feature, and you really do have to ride and care for them everyday to max out your profits. The timber industry side of the game is a lot of fun, too.

The equipment used in this game is far reaching, and again the mod world has only added to the huge selection one can play with. I haven't yet tried multiplayer and would imagine that could be a ton of fun, especially when a player has to clear those bales from the fields, the hired help can't do it. 

My biggest like right out of the box is the in depth realism and play options available. My biggest dislike is the AI needs help in the hire a worker department. It seems most times they skip parts of fields, don't catch the end rows well, and usually find every way possible to collide with objects. In a game world this big, my gripe may be small, but if your paying help to complete a field, the AI should knock it out.  Course play helps a little in that area, and there are helpful mods to speed up your working progress. 

I could go on about my hits and misses in this game, but eh....pick yourself up a copy and kick them there tires. All the dust and mud you want to conjure up is in there!

There's a lot to do.. it really is an open world farming game and feels  huge when first starting out.  Grow crops, raise livestock, forestry,   Small or large farms.  Buy or sell land, and set up your farm however and wherever you want. You can use prebuilt farms, or buy a field, pave it over and make one yourself - lay out your buildings however you want.  There's landscaping where you can add pavement, dirt roads, plant trees, level out soil.   Start with a pickup and a chainsaw and work your way up to the big machines, if you want.  It's easy to add money if you want by enabling the developer console.  So you can give yourself a budget to build out a starter farm, and then run it and make it profitable.  You can play however you want.  So much variety in maps and equipment.  Literally hundreds of pieces of equipment available to try.  Add the seasons mod for a whole new style of game play.  It's a big (and still very active) modding community, and new maps and mods are screened and approved by the developer and released pretty much daily. - accessible in-game without having to go to third party sites.  Also has a fun youtube community.   I've gotten a lot out of this game.  After almost 900 hours I finally feel like I'm hitting a point where I've done about every aspect and there's very little challenge left.. but there was plenty of challenge along the way, and I still feel drawn to play it - if anything to try out all of the new maps and equipment that keep getting released.  Plus, in the process, I've learned quite a bit about different types of farm equipment and find it all pretty interesting.

6,59874631,english,"I dunno why but I found myself wasting so much time into this game than I thought.
I think part of it is that, compared to ATS and ETS 2 or other loved games like H3VR, I don't have to use a wheel or put on the HMD and controllers, respectively. I find that this game is best played using a controller as, compared to the likes of other vehicular games, you need to be moving the camera around a lot and a dual-analog controller fits better than a steering wheel. Add in the fact that this game has no Force Feedback and a handful of machines do not use the usual wheel an pedals that you're used to and it makes more sense to use a controller.
Farming Simulator 19 is also a big step in that, much like previous games with Challenger and New Holland, this iteration brings the first licensed appearance of John Deere with the Platinum Expansion adding CLAAS later on.
In terms of simulation, I'd say this game handles more like those R/C farm exhibits that are especially popular in Germany with a controller and I don't say this like it's a bad thing. That makes it easier to sit down and play this game for long sessions at a time.

Another praise is how easily you can mod this game, GIANTS keeps their files readily in standard formats versus the 95% of developers that use hard-to-crack proprietary formats. This leads to a lot of mod potential and you can find these mods to add additional realism to the game such as GPS steering for straight lines, seasons with crop rotation, realistic gears and terrain handling for vehicles, etc.
Granted, Sturgeon's Law can apply but most low-quality mods are not even on the website or in-game browser and you can filter to only see the top-rated mods to ensure you get quality.

Im not going to go into it very much because im sure others can explain it better. The biggest problem is lack of mods/community for this game. In FS17 there were new mods almost every week for the entire span of the game that continued to impress me. There was also a striving community, plenty of Youtubers were getting on and trying the game out and it just felt more like there was a community. Now that has mostly changed. It seems like almost no new gamechanging mods have been added at all in this game and its a year old. In 13 we had logging. In 15 we had Courseplay. In 17 we had Seasons. There has not been a mod that ive found that has seriously changed the game to where Giants might add it as a feature in future versions. There is also a problem with maps. This could be partly community, but there have been less than 3 maps that are brand new this year that i consider good enough to start a game on. The rest are all from previous games with small addons. I dont have a reason for this, but its very sad. This is one of my favorite games and i have to put up with terrible mods and nobody to talk about the game with. Wish we could go back to 13-15-17. Hopefully Giants can find some way to make 21 feel unique and exiting to get.

I now have over 400 hours on farming simulator 2019 i love playing the game but i believe that it has taken a more arcade approach than a simulator approach towards farming i would like to see a physics implemented in the game that allows you to get stuck in mud the more times you drive over the same place i think it also need more features in the machines such as GPS also i think it would be a lot better in my eyes if the pricing of machines and land was a lot more realistic with added features such as the ability to have machines on demonstration of if you can not buy them out right then finance on the specific machine you are looking to purchase.
The ability to own land and rent it out to other players on multiplayer also the ability to sell you products that you make such as bales crops or even you machines to others NPC/Players on multiplayer for a more emersive simulator feeling the cost of bills could be a little better also such as road tax insurance etc on anything that is able to go on road as that in my eyes is what a simulator is to simulate life.
One more thing i would like to see more info on machine spec such as torque weight etc and the ability to buy new or used machines.

78,59198125,english,"Farming Simulator 19 is in many ways an upgrade from 17, and there's plenty I like about it, but there's many times while playing 19 that I miss things about 17.

[h1]CONS;[/h1]

The maps in 19 are horrible. I've played both maps for many hours and I can never get used to them. They are plain, boring, small, and overall not fun to play.

Parts of the maps are unavailable with larger tractors because of how poorly they are designed. The selling locations often have very tight corners with random junk in the way making getting into the locations (such as the ports) a huge pain. Some of them even have entrances but no exits, requiring you to back your semi truck back out of the selling locations. They are just overall very bad design.

Some tractors in 17 are missing from 19 for seemingly no reason? You can get a Case IH Steiger with both wheels or tracks in 17, but in 19 you can only get a Steiger with tracks. There is NO OPTION for a Case IH Steiger with wheels..

Physics are wonky. I often run into invisible objects that make my vehicle glitch out and sometimes fling across the map.

UI in my opinion is worse. The white UI disappears when against the sunny sky, and you need to move the camera angle down into the dirt to see what time it is or how much money you have.

Giants have released many official ""mods"" on the Mod Hub that are great, but it can get annoying if you want to play with your friends and you have to download the same tractors. I don't understand why the official ""mods"" from Giants are not added directly to the game via an update. That way everyone can easily play with all of the tractors without having to download them all individually.

[h1]PROS;[/h1]

[list]
[*] Store UI is amazing. Being able to see the model and customize it before you buy it is incredible.
[*] Graphics are much better and look less plastic than in previous games.
[*] More crops and animals adds more to the game.
[*]John Deere being official is great.

The game is good. Luckily mods can fix most issues and they are available directly from the modhub in the game.

4. Maps look atrocious and are poorly designed.
5. Graphics really aren't an improvement. Looks like you guys just up'd the contrast and called it a day. We were promised a fully rework graphics.
6. Game feels clunky and sloppy. FPS cap, LOD is terrible.
7. the map terrain is so screwed up you cant climb them with a vehicle that has 900hp

Which could be planted with more animals. Mechanics, sounds: falling trees, driving mechanics poor. Arable land is plowed when it is grubbed up and then requires close proximity even though it has already been done.

68,58506553,english,"[b]Overall:[/b]
It's a nice step forward in the Giants Farming Simulator series and it is well worth the money if you're new to the farming simulator genre.  Giants is [b]THE[/b] top dog in the farming simulator world of gaming.  But for long time fans/players I would wait for it to go on sale because, sadly, there just isn't enough new additions to justify paying full price for this release.

[b]TL;DR[/b]
At the time of writing this review I've only tinkered with FS19 for around 5 hours but I feel, considering that I'm a long time player that has played every iteration of Giants FS series since FS2009 [b]and[/b] I have released maps/mods to the community over the years as well, that 5 hours was enough time to preview all of the new additions to this version.

Sometime between the release of FS15 and FS17 I began to come to the slow realization that Giants was turning their Farming Simulator series into a cash grab.  While each version of the game arguably has an impressive, real to life, lineup of machinery to use in the game it just seems that Giants has lost focus on a few things.  What I mean by that is while it may be nice to drive around a pretty tractor if that tractor can only drive around there really is no point now is there?

There is so much more to farming that just planting, tilling, fertilizing, harvesting, and raising animals.  What about agricultural industry?  What about seasons?  Mods are filling this void and I hope Giants is taking note of this.  They have in the past and I hope they go back to that as they once did when they added the most popular mods like logging, cruise control, vehicle washing, etc, etc.

Is this a bad game?  No.  Not at all.  It's a very good game.  It's stable and it plays very nicely.  There are quite a few new additions that are really nice and I'm not complaining one bit.  It's just that I believe Giants needs to get back to being more mindful of their community going forward is all.",1574992422,1574992422,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198068870262,379,50,10395,0,309,1596315434,,

89,47316957,english,"Really nice game, sure I have found some buggs but its still early to say the game is crap just casue of buggs.

I havent play so much Singel Player so cant review so much about that.

About Multiplayer, I see so much Improvment since Farm Sim 17.
First that comes to mind are the graphic, way better grass, shadows, sky and so on.  The way the grass and bushes move then  you drive over it is awesome.

Second, That you can own your own farm in Multiplayer mode are so nice.  First  you start to buy the land areas you wanna start your farm on,  then you buy the tractors and equippment you want. And your friends can choose there own way to run there farm, not as in the previous Farm Sim when you share one farm. And you can still give your friends access to your farm and vise versa so you can still help eachother out.

Third, Repairs, its so nice to finally see another ""running cost""  then before.  In previous Farm Sim you had to sell and buy a new Tractor or Equippment after a while cause of the daily running cost. Here you can go back to Workshop / Store and repair the veichle, so here you dont get ""forced"" to sell a tractor just cause its old and cost a fortune to own.

Fourth, Beautiful maps, I have only played on one map and just checked the other one out, but the dynamics are so much improved. The feild are not just flat and boring.  One think Im little dissapointed at are the traffic, still looks very stiff and not so animated and they drive like crazy drunks.  But thats not what this game is about so I can live with that.

Now I havent more to write for now, still a very new game so hope they make some bugfix and so on what players find in the game.  :)  :D",1544052768,1574963675,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561197972424905,255,14,37032,1115,2689,1601241027,,

25,46847086,english,"Being a reasonably experienced Farm Sim player since 2011 (also own previous versions), I had high hopes for FS19 before release. It seemed as if Giants had done a complete overhaul to the engine and made it look much nicer than previous versions.

And in my opinion, they didn't dissapoint. Of course, my potato bag of a computer isn't quite the machine you'd want to be playing this game, but upon opening the game, I was already impressed by the new GUI/HUD and loading screens. The graphics, after some tweaking, look much nicer and full of colour than FS17, albeit a slight bit more saturated for my liking. Lighting and reflections look much better and bounce of the tractors and implements nicer.

Vehicle handling seems to have improved. From what I remember as a comparison, FS15 was very slidy, tractors would tend to drift everywhere. FS17 fixed this, but hardened it too much and made the tractors grip to the ground like velcro, but I personally prefered it to FS15. FS19 has loosened it up a bit, but the gravity of the game feels lighter, as if you are nearer the moon than anything. As far as detail of vehicles goes, serious improvements. They look much cleaner and nicer, and lighting for screens and dashboards is another nice touch, along with cab suspension and moving parts inside (pedals, levers, etc). Steering is another change to the game, where instead of the steering returning to its normal positioning when the button is let go, it will stay in it's current position, and steer back when the tractor is moving.

The placeable buildings feature is something I'm not very keen on. I preferred it when the sheds and silos were preplaced, like in previous games. This only applies to 2 of the 3 gamemodes, where the first 'Easy' mode already has tractors and sheds laid out for you, where as the other 2 leave you with nothing (one does give you a hefty sum of cash to start out with).

As many reviews say, bugs are a big problem in the game at this stage. Graphics, handling issues, glitches, many things to name, but as of now I shall not mention any because they have been in pretty much 90% of all reviews. The game is in its very early stages, people, give it time, the game is in store for many improvements. Patience.

So if you are keen on FS19, whether it be the new tractors, horses or just want an upgrade, get on now! But if you want to hold out until Christmas or maybe earlier/later, FS17 will do you fine until that time. Instead of naming every single feature in this crappy review of mine, I'll leave it to the other reviewers more serious than me to take care of that, or even better, get in your wallet and buy it yourself. From my point of view, it'll be worth it.",1543102103,1574889858,True,3,0,0.547558426856994629,0,True,False,False,76561198095986055,70,47,21197,0,1760,1599480994,,

Well Giants did it agian. They amazed me all over again with FS19. ""But RavenAlpha what about the pros & cons?"". Well here they are.

Pros:
New engine.
John Deere (Who does not like them!?).
Horses... Everybody loves horses.
Birds.
Cotton.
Oat.
You can choose to build your farm from the ground and up.
No more buying fields. You buy pieces of land.
You can sell those pieces of land again.

Cons:
Still much to work on.
No Claas.
No danish map (Seriously Giants where the f**k is Denmark!? We are one of the biggest in export of farming goods).

I love the fields system
Graphics are lovely
Improved placeable system
Improved field care (with lime and weeds).
The repair feature instead of daily maintenance cost so i can keep all my old tractors and equipment in a sort of storage area.

Cons:
No penalty or reduce in price for either doing contracts on a field or selling your field. I can easily start a game and buy a harvester, header, trailer and tractor then go round buying fields with grown crop, harvesting it and selling both the crop and field to only gain more money.

19,57377318,english,"1) This game feels like previous versions, with some texture updates. Does this make it worth upgrading to? Does it make it look nicer? Yes.
2) New equipment - notably from John Deere is nice, however lackluster in the amount. Same with Claas in the (lackluster) DLC. Just as well off using DLC
3) No more grabbing a stick and flying across the map :( 
4) Feels like a well rounded game, but some of the pricing seems off esp for selling crops. This is a real world vs fictionary area thing though
5) Two maps? Really? There are SO MANY modded maps out there - I find it very hard to believe that you couldn't certify a few of them (and maybe pay the modder(s) for huge community approval? DLC anyone?
6) Very mixed feel on multiplayer. The synchronizing on server every time someone joins is horrific - why? As a computer tech I understand a need for a 'break in production' to bring in a new item into a live database, but why can we not smoothly transition like so many other games (read:ARK) The world there is almost the same size as ravenport with as much detail.
7) On the subject of servers. What the f. Why do I have to pay for an extra copy of the game (not to mention all the DLC I want to run) to run a dedicated server? I mean yes this is MUCH cheaper than renting from a worthless host and much more satisfying for experience. but WHY? Almost every other game out there gives me a FREE dedi app
8) Also on the subject of multiplayer - whawt the f is up with this freezing during play? Every 15-30 minutes. Yes I know there are save points - again as an IT person I know that databases deal with online saves that don't interrupt services. If this wasn't the case there would be 5-20 minute windows every 1-2 hours where hospitals would be offline. Not only that but games such as ARK and Minecraft have 0 issues despite huge maps and mods...
9) Oh! As a dedi server admin FIX THE UPDATE FOR THE DEDI APP. I don't need to download 4GB of data and run a patch every time when my client downloads 100mb and can update the client. Get your crap in a heap GIANT.

Overall - Great game, if you haven't hit another in the series I seriously recommend it. I would hugely say forget the DLC and go get the mods. As a community game for a streamer there are minimal issues. Check out the Modded maps.

Giants software spent time on setting a esport series but zero time on bringing seasons to a farming game ...  game after 10 years still has ZERO concept of seasons.  One of the most important variables in farming..  SIM Farm from the 90s had more realistic farming.  I know you have alienated a large part of your long time players by ignoring them and catering to console players that will play your game for a month and put it down.   the weeds are nothing but a replacement for a fertilizing step and completely shallow gameplay.  

I have played since early FS13 days and FS has been the only game i kept playing (because of mods) but my time with Giants and FS are over.

UPDATE:  I am still thumbs down for the base game.  However, modders have now made this game mostly what it should have been done by Giants.  The ONLY reason I have hours on this game are the modders.

It is absolutely amazing if you love a good vehicle sandbox. If you already played FS before then you already know it's great, but graphics, John Deere, and horses are fun enough for another try if you're considering it! Alternatively, if you've never played, this is a great time to start. Excellent vehicle sandbox where all vehicles have tons of features, options, and uses. Raising animals is awesomely fun. Even if you have played a lot of the previous simulators consider that there are new maps, content, and the fact that us noobs need your help please :P 

You've heard the ups, now here are the downs. 

-For new players, the tutorial doesn't cover menu usage, where to sell most things, multiplayer game mechanics, or how to do any maintenance on animals. Veteran players, Youtube and the forum are a great resource at that point. FS19 is still pretty new, but I've found that some FS17 tutorials are really helpful still. 
And I can't stress this enough, if you're a gamer instead of a farmer, you WILL NOT have a clue what's going on, and the game will give you very limited tutorials that make you feel extremely frustrated. If you find it worth it, look up what information you can but the game itself will not provide enough useful information to enjoy it.

The controller support is laughable, there is a line about 3 feet in front of my combine where the graphics change that just moved along a fixed distance in front of the vehicle. I've had a couple of crashes that seem to relate to controller mix and I'm fighting with stupid things like not being able to properly rotate the vehicles in the 3D preview. None of this is game breaking but it is hugely frustrating and I don't want to fight to make my games work in my very limited free time.

Another issue I have is that you want people to be able to add animals, bit the ground never seems to be level enough to actually add the buildings and the ground edit tool, while helpful, takes the unskilled a long time to really mess the ground up.

Each new game, offers new gameplay and better improvements worth paying the small one time fee. Honestly, the DLC packs are not entirely worth it unless you specifically are wanting material in that pack. Reason why I say that because the modding community is so large, you can get a massive piece of content from an independent creator for free. Which brings me to modding. It cannot be easier to download and install mods for this game. I do wish there was workshop support, but I feel that would become over saturated quick.

I tried so hard to appreciate it, and all it does is act as a constant, buggy, thorn in my side.  

Being able to modify the terrain sounds great in theory, but instead, because of how the fields are laid out, becomes a necessity. And it's ridiculously expensive, finicky, and will downright glitch out fields so they are unusable.  

You thus spend more time and effort just trying to create a canvas of land to work with, before you can even start the elaborate process of re-drawing fields with a plow (which you will have to do again).  Leaving you with an utter mess.

you can't unload  everywhere you want  ( not good if you play  RP start from zero  if you don't own the field of half of the map you not allow to do so )

physic can be bad  sometime ( when overload or  fork hit the  ground  make bad collision  and you can go fly  'it funny')

the  building 'Place Object'  is good  if you are using mod  otherwise it  totally   a problem if you try to place a  hangar too close to a  pole it will not be  possible  to place it   and you can't remove the pole or anyother actual 'object'  to actually  place  your  hangar there but it some detail that you can easy fix with mod

58,56937690,english,"At about 30 hours in, I can tell you honestly that this game is oddly satisfying and insanely addictive. Another aspect that I find alluring, yet unexpected is how relaxing it is. As a pilot, my job is often stressful and I find this simple Farming Sim to be a great place to unwind and enjoy the scenery. I haven't even explored the world of logging or animals yet! 

Pros: 
-simple gameplay with complex elements, basics are easy but there is a depth to the economics and the machinery that keeps it interesting past the first harvest. 
-gorgeous landscapes!
-Try the radio function, I particularly enjoy the live stream of current hit music.

Cons
-Driving gets a bit squirrelly at higher speeds and the physics with the vehicles/terrain/trailers gets a bit wonky. This isn't a driving game so I'm not to bothered by it, but getting a trailer stuck on a stop sign is at times annoying.

59,56936372,english,"Firstly, for context, I am a 36M, married with 2 kids who also play FS. After playing hundreds of hours in FS15 and FS17, mostly vanilla, after only 8hrs I find FS19 is a complete let-down. I play primarily for the logging experience, which in FS17 wasn't perfect but was far far better than FS19. The logging physics has been completely ruined in FS19. Stock wheel loader has lower reach making loading the log trailer very difficult unless parked lower. The log grabber doesn't tip back hardly more than horizontal making it very difficult (especially on a grade) to roll logs deeper into the jaws. The closing physics of the log grabber is also broken resulting in many logs clipping through even when gripped evenly, firmly, and moving slowly. On average, only 3 logs can be grabbed regardless of size etc. Even the tractor log grabber is worse now than FS17, with sticky and clipping logs happening far more often.

The only truck I have so far is the Warrior, which apparently has only 1 gear, or maybe a CVT? The horn is also absolutely pitiful.

The train horn has also been ""upgraded"" from FS17, which had a very realistic crescendo and auto-repeated if held. FS19 train horn is just a single note that starts and ends abruptly. Why would this be changed?

The only improvements worth mentioning is the visuals and more realistic hydraulics and steering.

After reading through the reddit sub I see now that all these logging issues have been complained about for up to and over a year now with no improvements. Very slack of the developers not to address these issues. I will be returning to FS17 for the logging experience and will not be recommending FS19 to anyone looking for improved logging.",1573404930,1573404930,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561197995755416,32,1,979,0,539,1596990342,,

I recommend looking up the MODs available to ease troubles and add more realism to the game. Little bugs that are not game changers but i can tell time was not put into detail (harvesters unloading into trailer and it shows harvest going through the trailer), those kind of bugs and lack of detail. Despite my little issues this game has me hooked! I have not stopped playing this game since I bought it! 

I am excited to see more additions to this game in the future. Curious why a watering system was not considered as part of a farm simulation? Irrigation up to small straight line wheel watering units and later upgrading to the big round field units, seems like a no brainer to me. More home choices. When i sleep my helpers are sped up to where they would be in the hours i slept. Instead I sleep and they are still in the area of field they were working on when i wake. 

I would like to see more ""Farming"" simulation as opposed to farming machine simulation. Making contracts with local businesses or big business outside the valley. Like for instance a major food chain chooses your potatoes for their fries. Selling hay bails to local farmers and other states. Picking a contract and then selecting machinery  you have to use and lease item you don't. Lease to own equipment. Natural disasters and seasons. Predators of livestock. I want to farm, not simulate equipment (though it is still fun). Farming simulator 20 could be pretty dang awesome if more of the ""Farming"" is implemented. Add more fields.

Pros:
John Deere
More equipment for implements.
Better Graphics
Foliage bending
 Weeds and Crop Destruction added to game without mods
Beautiful base game maps  (Ravenport for USA and FelsBrunn for Italy)
New Sounds 
Dynamic Weather.
Cabin physics (like the seats bouncing up and down and moving pedals.
Very Modable


Cons:
Vehicle Handling is Different this year
Trucks Bottom out when emptying at Railroad Silos
Tutorials aren't that good and you may have to turn to Youtube for Tutorials
Not as Much John Deere as you think there is.
Game is a bit laggy when  recording.

My PC is, to be honest, a box of crap. My graphics card is kept cool by another fan laying under it, blowing up. I have just 4GB of ram. So I assumed the game would be sluggish. In some ways, yeah, it is. Some grass textures and groups of vehicles are two of the things that makes the game stutter until whatever it is passes out of the camera view. I use a lot of mods which are all loaded with the game. Other than that, no issues.

I'm loving it and have about 500hrs into it so far. I only play solo so have no report on multiplayer. Without mods, this game would be boring as heck and not worth it. The same was for FS 15 (which I played a LOT) and FS 17 (which I didn't like and didn't play much at all).

Now, I play on the hardest settings and I'm still pretty sure this isn't even 1% of how hard it is to be a farmer, but I appreciate the challenge this game gives me.
It has a great variety of equipment I had never even heard of before. And each piece has its own properties and quirks I need to get used to and I find this variety fascinating. They add new equipment in each DLC.
But the game doesn't have to be all this hard - you can set it up to be very forgiving for a simple and calm farming experience to just chill out. For a calm evening, just driving a tractor and listening to a good radio (Simulator Radio is awesome, btw), I would *highly* recommend this game.
The gameplay is solid, still has a few small kinks to iron out, but enhanced greatly with mods.

42,56282561,english,"Hello fellow digital farmers,

After having played this game / simulation for more than 700 hours, i thought it was time for a detailed review of this so addictive game / simulator. And why so extensive? Because this game / simulation simply deserves it and it is not that easy to explain, why this is so attractive and becoming more and more popular.

To begin with, you see as a reader, that i find it difficult under which category i can place this game. It can lead a wonderful life as a simulation, but it is just as well a game with its limitations within the game engine.  Of course it's just A game and you'd say it's done. But the ""game"" includes so much more than that. 

The developers of this game have made a nice balance between: just a good game and a relatively realistic simulation. Elements such as invisible walls / hit boxes are still present here and there, but are not overwhelmingly present. A balance between an arcade game and a simulation is perhaps a bit too black and white in a comparison, but it certainly has roots that direction sometimes.

You notice that every time it is 2 aspects  that mix with each other every now and then. They alternate well each time. That not only ensures a good gaming experience, but makes judging about this game / simulation quite difficult. Sometimes you get annoyed  by the ""woody feeling"" that the game makes you feel and at other times it presents itself wonderfully smoothly. 

A game with two faces.

Graphically beautiful, but again not really eye candy.
Sound is certainly not bad,  but not great either.
The gameplay is pretty easy to do, but really well-arranged, no.
The tutorial is pretty good and teaches you the basics, but there is so mush more in the game, that you sometimes have to discover it by trail and error. 

As you read, every time there is something good, but also a bit less good things.
A balance that is so well mixed that you can make every setback disappear again, by something good that the game / simulator will surprise you with. 

What is the real power of this game / simulator than?

Can you drive around with big fat cool looking tractors? Yes! - Check.
Can you work with the largest and most expensive equipment? Yes! - Check.
Can you design and build your own farm? Yes! - Check.
Does it also support, keeping animals on my farm? Yes! - Check.
Oh, does it support MOD's? Oh yes and how! - Check.
Can i also use other landscape maps than the vanilla ones? Pff...yes! - Check.
Does it also support multiplayer? Thats almost the best thing about it! - Check.
Is there perhaps also online in-game radio? Yes! Yes! Yes! - Check.
But can i change the colors of my purchased verhicles?......yeah.
Is it also educational and do you learn somthing from it, in the field of agriculture? (the parent says) Yes ofcource.
Is it replayable than? That is the purpose of this game...lol.
Is it expensive to purchase the game? Not really.
Are there DLC's too? You're kidding, right? Bloody hell yeah.
Are there any bad things about this game? 

No, not worth mentioning and now keep your mouth shut and make me money at the farm.
Just gooddamn buy it!...lol",1572703975,1572705829,True,26,4,0.689498245716094971,6,True,False,False,76561197985630190,75,6,111725,4010,42995,1602021983,,

85,56194570,english,"If you're looking for a good representation of anything agriculture and livestock for anywhere outside of Switzerland, you will not find it here. Giants, the developers of Farming Sim, have a clear, unethical, and unapologetic bias for central European agriculture and equipment. Every tractor is modeled after the EU version, with all EU hitches and Germanic signage on the equipment with large EU wheels and front linkages. This game is marketed as a Farming Simulator but in reality it is only about central European agriculture and not simulating. 
The BIGGEST CON:
The most frustrating part about this game is a dark legacy of Farming Simulator games, the physics, or lack there of. There is not realistic physics simulation in Farming Simulator 19. Each vehicle is adjusted via xml file with a hand full of simple stats in order to create the illusion of vehicle physics. There are simple animations of the vehicle that actually have their origins in community mods of previous Farming Simulator games. Much like every major improvement to each new FS game, are refined community mods from previous games except for the lighting system in this game.
The performance on large maps or small maps with a lot of equipment,
 (about how many pieces of equipment a medium farm would have in real life),
is poor. The frame rate is inconsistent in these two conditions, maxing out when looking away from your farm, but chugging when looking at it, or sometimes in just a certain direction of the map. This can be caused by a hidden issue with any given map, but it is usually an unexplainable phenomenon when looking at the map from the Giants Editor program. This is with an i7 7700k, GTX 1080, 16GB OC ram, 1TB WD SSD. A system that is not a slouch by any means.

Overall, this is a fun game but you HAVE to come to terms with these few things;
 - It will NOT be a simulator.
 - If you want any other style of map, equipment, or farm buildings, you will have to look towards the 
   community mods.
 - Performance on high grade PCs will be subject to variables due to the way the game is built.

As well as all of this, the fact is, this game is the best option for a farming game. If there was an alternative with a focus on North American agriculture, I would play that instead. 
Again, the worst thing about this game is its inherent narrow focus on central European ag. 

TLDR;

Pros:
Sizable modding community
Multiplayer
Easily modded for absolute beginners
Fun with controller

Cons:
Not a simulator
Primitive 'physics'
2D crop textures
Extreme lack of Global ag styles (lacking North American and other worldly equipment, maps, buildings)

I got the game at launch and admit it was a rough start but now after about a year it's pretty much bug free.  As for gameplay I find it awesome, lots of people complain about the fact that there is a lack of american styled equipment in game and they aren't wrong but it was developed by a company based out of the eu so what do you expect.  If you want american equipment it's simple, mods.  Mods are what make this game so great, hell with the mods available now you can turn this game into a logging simulator and now recently there are mods that allow you to dig dirt and make hills with a dozer, so basically the possibilities are endless (shoutout to some of the great modders like JHHG Modding and Custom Modding!) all in all I would say this game is amazing and if you liked fs17 or 15 this is definitely a worthy upgrade",1572401035,1572401035,True,38,1,0.752840161323547363,2,True,False,False,76561198862958418,16,2,85891,1008,63329,1602040617,,

63,45939924,english,"Please read before buying Farming Simulator 19!!!!

I've read through on alot of the reviews and came to a conclusion that FS19 is about average or above average. There is alot of good, but there's alot of bads too, I'll give some of my opinions and share some aswell!

Alright I'll start with my opinions
Good:

• The visual overhaul is great as it gives more life to the environment

• The HUD change is great as it looks clearer and looks more pleasing to the eye, as well as the additional options such as being able to change the keybind without having to go to the main menu is also good!

• The addition of John Deere equipment is great!



Bads:

• The new Platinum edition/expansion is in my opinion not worth the name Platinum, it's more like an CLAAS DLC since there is only equipment. No maps... NO MAPS?!?! I've followed you since 2015 and both 17 and 15 had new maps, and now I came across 19 where I only get pitty equipment with no fun map to play on, smh for sure.

• Physics is an enemy of mine when it comes to the farming simulator franchise, one example is that I cannot load bales manually because the bales are basically rocks that weigh less than a gram, seriously, where is the squishy grip?? I cannot grab a bale without it sliding off or flying to space. And while I managed to load 1 bale and about to place 1 more on the trailer, the slightes bump will make it slide off the trailer.

• The game is overall boring, whenever I feel like playing farming simulator 19 I hop on a map on either SP or MP and while I can easely play for 20 minutes as soon as I reach about 30 minutes of gameplay and I get workers doing most of the jobs because it is either too boring or it takes too long to do. And I'll just kinda quit because It's boring.


Overall conclusion on what this/next game needs to update on:

• Better gameplay experience
• Better physics
• Plan better DLCs (Overall poor)


Don't take this as hate, I still play the game, but I think I could get a better experience if the game was a bit updated with the things I've listed above. I totally recommend you to buy this game if you are a fan of farming or willing to become a farmer IRL.

However, it's 2019 and there are some other games that simply embarrasses Fs19. Take SpinTires for instance. This game shows how terrain can be faithfully reproduced and how it can be affected by vehicle tyres and weight. 
I feel like I'm in the year 2000, FS19 simply doesn't cut it. Then there's the physics, it's a struggle to contemplate the way some vehicles behave, especially when you're driving at a fair speed and you can simply drive up or over things and there seems to be no realistic shift in weight or inertia in these huge vehicles. Then there's the night setting, where driving along a road is dangerous as your headlights only illuminate about 25 metres ahead of you. Just basic stuff that seems overlooked.

17,55711241,english,"Farming Simulator 19 is a great game if you enjoy the feeling of accomplishing something while you're doing something else.

When I started playing FS19, I had no idea what I was doing. The tutorials are great, they show you what to do to have a successful harvest, how to do it and in what order, but that's about it. Then it throws hundreds of machines at you and says, ""Have fun, make money"". It took me a bit to get used to what does what, which is better than what, and so on, but while the learning curve could be a bit high for someone who's only used farming equipment for tobacco on a 1-acre farm (ME!), it was a lot of fun.

I enjoyed the visuals. Graphics are very nice, though sometimes I notice blips here and there that take me away from immersion, especially when I'm plowing a field. Not a big deal though. Every machine looks great. As you use them, they get dirtier and dirtier, and I really enjoyed that. At home, we never cleaned the machines. We just had a mentality that they were gonna get dirty, so why bother cleaning mud off? So you have the option of using a pressure washer to clean your machines if you prefer them to look shiny, but I never bothered. I really enjoyed the look of a dirty machine after plowing or seeding a field. It made it look like I actually did something.

The sounds are great, too! When you get in a tractor and start going, you feel like you're in a machine with lots of HP! You can turn your machine sound down if you prefer, along with a slew of other sound options (nice touch), which I definitely liked. I didn't care for the radio much. I would usually turn on Spotify while I was farming, so didn't bother much with their in-game radio.

The game itself can get a little rote. Some fields, especially modded ones, can be huge, and they can take literal hours to plow, seed, fertilize, etc. Its here that my beginning statement shines. I love audiobooks. I find myself with a lot of time at home were I'm conflicted on what to spend my time on. Reading? Gaming? Why not both? I'll start an audiobook, turn down the sound on FS19, and then get to work. Hours later, I have accomplished two things at once. And who says only women multitask?

Farming Simulator is a great game with a huge number of machines at your disposal. Does it get every aspect of farming right? Probably not. So I'm not sure how accurate the ""simulation"" part of the game is. But is it fun, and can you see the fruits of your labor rather quickly? Yes, and yes.

I have over 150 hours clocked up in FS17, which was a game I found to be highly addictive. So I thought I was on to a winner when I bought FS19.

Unfortunately not. Don't get me wrong. This is just as addictive as it's predecessor, but..... that's about it. I Only started playing a couple of days ago, and having clocked 10+ hours now, I still haven't really noticed any improvements or advantages over FS17. One of the marketing claims was a massive graphical improvement. Well... where is it? All i've noticed is a horrible and somewhat exaggerated orange peel effect on vehicle bodywork. I haven't seen anything else which has been graphically improved.

The main things that annoyed me in FS17 are still present in FS19:

- Helpers still cannot identify a separation between fields. So if you set up one worker to plow a field, keep an eye on them, otherwise you could be losing an entire neighbouring field of crops as well!
- Helpers still cannot finish a task if the field they are working in is not square/rectangular. I've already had messages popping up saying ""Helper X has completed their task"" when in fact half of the field has been missed, because it curves one way or the other.

The beacons all appear to have broken lenses. The silver colour of the rotating reflector is always visible, as if a piece of the lens is missing.

The controls are a bit messed up compared with FS17. I have assigned all the same controls between the two games. But in FS19, when I press the button assigned to Rear Work Lights, I get the Pause Menu. On foot, if I walk forward, the chainsaw appears. I ended up having to sell it to solve that problem.

There are various little issues like this which you really wouldn't expect to find in a game which claims to have been massively overhauled and refined since the previous version.


Maybe I just haven't put enough time into the game yet, but the fact the helper issues are still present is incredibly frustrating. Having to go round after them to correct their mistakes or finish the job they were meant to do (just as I had to in FS17), defeats the object of hiring them at all.

I'll continue to play, since it is, in essence, still very addictive. It's just a shame that it's really a re-badged version of FS17.

50,47474826,english,"The Farming Simulator Series is an ever-evolving franchise as well as being continuously refined. Each release brings forth new graphics enhancements, new features, new game mechanics, but overall it's the same game. Each year along with all the new points comes the questions of ""why wasn't this added yet"" and ""did they release this seemingly unfinished"" product.

Not unique to the FS series, a lot of games appear to be released falling short of their vision and ambitions probably due to time and budget constraints. Sometimes it's painfully obvious. Other times, it appears as though they rely on the modding community to make up for their shortfalls. It may even be strategic. They may be just focusing on what is needed to get the game out and leaving the rest to the modders. 

To properly set the tone, I like FS19 and I expect to put in a many hours as I possibly can, having two jobs and a wife.

So the criticism here isn't simply to bash Giants or this series. It's simply to help push this already great game to an even greater game, where it should be.

Let's start off with addressing the multiple bug issues. This is quality control and quite often the best beta test is the initial release. So, despite all the bugs, some having affected me, they WILL be addressed and therefore, I don't want to talk about them. I want to focus on design and direction.

MAPS:
For the first time, Giants has produced some high-quality maps with textures, details, and an ambiance that really immerse me. The layout appears to be good, but I'll only know for certain once I'm several hours into the map. It's even been said, these new maps are almost GTA quality. That's saying a lot. I have noticed a severe absence of trees, but that's likely to prevent overwhelming weaker machines. For me, I have to customize my map, adding more forest and trees before I'll start. It really enhances the immersion for me.

EQUIPMENT:
Of course the tractors and such look even better than before. Every release, they'll improve the detail and textures as the player's hardware also improves. Are many different types of new equipment but very little of it dramatically changes the players farming strategy.

FEATURES: 
New crops, better chicken management, horses are added. Nothing exciting, but they're very much welcomed.

BUILD YOUR OWN FARM:
FINALLY... I've always wanted to start with nothing. No ability to get a loan. Oonly has a chainsaw and a pickup truck. Then go dominate the map.  Still can't quite do that but close enough. For now. The different game modes and improved contract work make this far more enjoyable. 

PATCH 1.2
Landscaping! About time! This is a feature I will really enjoy. How could they have implemented it better? By attaching the landscaping code/script to the machines. I want to level ground with a machine not a mouse cursor. That would be the ultimate feature to this game.

BEEFS:
Ok. Maybe it's just me, but I guess I compare things to a vision I have. There are things to me that seem obvious and how and why they've been neglected will just give me ulcers if I spend too much time thinking about it. 

- Decorative placeable objects: I don't mean the ""trees and shrubbery"" and such.I mean the buildings and ""garages"" and sheds that are purely decorative. Why are these decorative and not functional? There are barns, houses, shacks and sheds... and you want me to buy these for what? In fact, one of the barns is completely finished on the inside, with amazing textures, but can't you open the doors to get in and use it. I would really LOVE to see these ""decorative"" objects be patched with completed and functional versions. Also... why one house?

- Bushes/Shrubs: Sure the landscaping tool can remove them, but why can't I mow them? This is something that should have been added in FS15.  Mushrooms... mow them. Or pick them. 

- Certain objects: I love the junked car carcasses and other junk lying around. What I would love even more is being able to pick them up and move them or have them taken to the dump. I like the idea cleaning up my yard.

- Logs to Lumber: The modders have done it. Why hasn't this been implemented into the core game yet? So many things can be done with lumber.

I'll add more later.

This is the best release yet and I will be putting hours into it once a few mods kick in and I find a good map.",1544586508,1570413947,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198022347348,261,17,35766,0,1480,1600363134,,

I've never had an even remote interest in farming but this game has piqued my curiosity with regards to the process and everything about it. Hell, I'm searching real farming on YT, looking at and download hundreds of mods, watching community videos, you name it. 

The game itself is not easy and that's what makes it so much fun. Juggling funds, purchases, equipment, land, the bank, you name it is absolutely enthralling. Everything counts for something and that something you just bought might be the end of your farm and business. Or it might be the savior.  

1.) That said, I'd love the ability to add a custom logo to my vehicle/truck doors. I understand this would be somewhat hard to implement with regards to all the assets available, however, plopping it on the 2014 default truck door shouldn't be that big a deal in the grand-scheme-of-things.

2.) For the love of (your deity), please, please add Nvidia Ansel support. It would make screenshot capture so much easier and would render stellar results with regards to community interaction.

Now you can build your farm the way you want as the game has a new feature of terrain transforming (it is a bit painful to work with it but the possibility is there).

The game mechanics are still sometimes funny as I managed to see a few bugs during two hours of gameplay which could already been fixed almost a year after the release but it isn't something that would frustrate you excessively.

56,54671959,english,"Farming doesn't even interest me, and I love this game. It's a game that you can sink hundreds of hours into easily.

Pros:
1. Realistic approach to farming is actually very calming. It's a nice way to chill after a stressful day
2. The game is very immersive, so it creates a very Zen experience
3. Graphics are realistic, and there's the right amount of ""shake"" to make you feel like you're actually operating the vehicles
4. Multiplayer makes the game lots of fun to play with friends / family
5. Numerous ways that you can play the game, so you're not trapped into just crops if that's not your thing
6. Can be played as either a Tycoon where you try to amass as much wealth as possible, or you can pursue a more Zen experience (my personal approach to the game) by simply immersing yourself in the world. The game is very open world, so you are free to pursue what you would like

Cons:
1. The controls of a couple vehicles (the tree crane thing from the tutorial comes to mind) are beyond ridiculous, and very hard to learn.
2. There's a bit of a learning curve for the game in general. You'll go through an hour or two of tutorials before you feel even mildly comfortable starting. They haven't done anything wrong here. There's just so much that you can do in the game, and to achieve the level of realism they have reached it's necessary.
3. The game needs to explain (preferably with tooltips as your hover your mouse) all of the various icons. Someone who's not familiar with farming isn't going to instinctively know that baler X is only used to create round bales (or that there is no equipment that loads round bales, you have to do it manually), whereas baler Y will create square bales. The shop will just display some cryptic icons that mean nothing to anyone except the developers, and those that have spent hours googling to decipher these strange mostly unintuitive symbols. The text won't usually be helpful either for answering compatibility questions. It will simply say something like ARCO 650, and NONE of the equipment anywhere mentions ARCO 650, so you have no idea what it's compatible with, so you end up wasting many thousands of dollars experimenting. This is my biggest gripe about the game, and it's what turned my wife off to it even though I think it's a fantastic game. It just requires so much research outside the game to understand how to play it.

72,54605552,english,"Lets get this out of the way. I've been playing FS since 2013. Its one of my favorite game franchises. But it seems that after FS13, Giants has never really gave the games a big improvement and supposedly this was supposed to be that big improvement. The graphics are....okay. But I'll get into that later.

Pros:
- Lots of Brands! Great variety (although they insist on keeping the EU SMV warning signs so when you go to an American map it breaks my immersion)
- Purchasing land is a lot more realistic to me and more enjoyable.
- Finally, after years and years of waiting, we have a store where you can see what you're buying.
Cons:
- Hardly any real new improvements. Graphics are virtually the same as FS17 but with a few minor changes.
- Physics, they're laughable. Hit the accelerator in a John Deere 6155M and suddenly immediately you're going warp speed. Steering is still awful and gives no feedback, suspension on vehicles is stiffer than stiff. For a simulator series thats been going on for 10+ years, this is really bad considering I can boot up FS13 and get virtually the same experience.
- Horsepower? HA! That's irrelevant in FS19, doesn't matter what Harvester you get, you are stuck at the speed the game tells you to go.
- The game is optimized TERRIBLY, that reason alone is why I REALLY recommend to stick with one of the older games like FS15 or 17. Its jittery, barely runs at points if you look at more than one piece of equipment. For a game that graphically isn't much better than 17, its terribly thirsty for a really beefy system, and I can run games such as BO4 and GTA V at a solid 60FPS AT LEAST.
- Everything drives like a arcade racer. 
- AI workers are still, not useless, but about as close to useless as you can get. Because as long as you keep an eye on them and fix their mistakes they make (like not finishing the edges of a field) you should be fine. But that's just a band-aid for poor design.

Unfortunately, it seems Giants is more interested in adding things like....dogs? To the game instead of fixing existing issues. There's more cons that I haven't bothered to list since I believe they've already been so well documented to the point I think it should be easy to look them up. Its a shame, look at a game like Halo CE and 9 years later in Halo Reach, you can see major graphical improvements. Every iteration of FS doesn't feel like something I'd pay $30 for again but more so a $10 update to a previous game. Lets be honest, everything new in FS19 isn't anything that couldn't have been added to FS17 or FS15, and that's becoming a big problem with this series.

UPSIDES
The game looks beautiful, and has a lot of potential with the mod support.

The new customizable farms are fantastic, same with being able to see the customizations on your vehicle before buying it.

Giants finally got John Deere in the game, though they still haven't gotten any car brands for the pickups. Cotton and oats join the party of crops, along with horses and birds making their debut. The vehicles also lose paint over time, which is a nice touch. I also love the new mission system and land purchasing.

DOWNSIDES
And then there's the issues. First of all, the vehicle handling. This is a big one. Turning is not much different from Farming Simulator 2009. Driving a truck, which should feel like driving a two-ton vehicle, instead feels like driving a Hot Wheels toy car. A truck filled with 39 tons of grain drives like a car towing a shopping cart. This is dissappointing, as Euro Truck Simulator 2, a 7 year old game, handles like the real thing.

Glitches are a big problem in this game. Apart from glitches other reviewers mention, there's the problem where trailers wil run off if not hooked up to a tractor, while FS17, a two year old game, doesn't have that problem. The wool harvester will suddenly have the mechanical part inside the chamber clip through the roof. Will Giants fix these glitches? Well, not after one announcement where they said they will focus on DLC and only fix game breaking glitches.

With that being said, they can improve all this by improving the physics and keeping vehicles from FS17 in the basegame, and fixing the bugs plaguing the game. If they do this, I can finally reccommend this game.

+ Beautiful graphics
+ Massive selection of vehicles
+ 3D customization
+ Customizable farms
+ Vehicles now rust
+ John Deere is now in the game
+ Works on most computers
+ Mod support


- Game feels bland
- New maps are boring
- No gearbox
- Vehicle handling is still awful
- Horse handling is as awful as vehicle handling
- Background is overly blurred
- Unrealistic physics
- Glitches and bugs
- Barely any improvements on realism
- Traffic is still slow
- Old vehicles have been downgraded to mods
- Expensive DLC
- Some mods on the Farming Simulator website aren't on the ingame ModHub

This game was a major dissappointment for me. If anything can save this game, it's the modding community.

3/10, wait for sale or buy the downpriced FS17.

Edit 1: I found some mods on the website's ModHub that enhances gameplay. But when I look for them on the ingame ModHub, they're nowhere. You can't even use the search function to find them, either.

First. There is the many weird bugs at the start, there was a big update coming up long time after the release that really change the game, it was a game changer with the painting and landscaping.

Giants patched the game today, so; I can actually get into the game once again; at least that game breaking bug was fixed.  but with no patch notes avaliable, I don't know what else was fixed.  

as far as play-ability, for the most part, its a decent (not great) game.  there are still a few bugs and glitches, like sometimes not being able to connect to trailers, or combines/harvesters/bailers still registering a seed type in them even after emptying them, making it difficult to fold the units for transport on the maps.

I do appreciate the more realistic, tight and uneven farms that the maps have, adding in the complexity of having to determine the proper equipment to be used on the field in question.

I do not like the fact that there is no equipment trailers for small equipment like skid-steers, or forklifts that the pickup truck is able to pull; hopefully they fix this before the next edition of FS comes out.  driving a forklift/skidsteer across the map at 8-11mph early game when you can't afford the big lowboy trailer and the truck to haul it is a pain.  also the low-loader trailer (lowboy) doesn't have a way to strap down the load from what I can tell, it may be there, but it doesn't appear in the tool tips, or appear when next to the trailer; so large equipment tends to shift when using it to haul.  there also isn't any crates or pallets to store the chicken eggs in in the default game, there are some player mods that do this, but I guess Giants isn't looking at what the mod community is doing, as including their own variations of the most popular mods would greatly improve the quality of their product.

my previous review stated that I wouldn't recommend this game; however I am clicking Yes, this time simply because its a break away from the normal games I play, and it has actually been fairly relaxing... yes, a bit stressful when dealing with rain, and you need to harvest (can't harvest in the rain/hail) but, growing up on a dairy farm, that's actually fairly accuate; most equipment have difficulty operating in those weather conditions, so most farmers wouldn't even attempt it.",1544629482,1564856943,True,17,0,0.642749786376953125,0,True,False,False,76561198041767078,37,4,26249,0,5274,1591399996,,

(Graphics) Good and bad. Lighting in SOME instances is better and in others looks cartoony. Tractos and vehicles look OKAY mostly plastic like they drive especially the tires. 

(Gameplay) This is the only thing that has improved with a lot of new options, but in the end terrible physics make or break the game for me.

A couple issues from the long list
-Atrocious AI (which they somehow managed to make worse than the 2 previous titles?!?)
-No policing/almost zero support to prevent rampant multiplayer trolling
-Don't even get me started on their broken physics

Edit: Servers were never great, recently they've become terrible. Players frequently lose connection to mp games!

Not only are the controls extremely fucking clunky, and the hitboxes are absolute trash, the game in itself is boring without someone to play with.

Along with this, the multiplayer is buggy.
There's a train in singleplayer, where is it in multiplayer, why can't I use it?

Along with this, there's several bugs present in multiplayer, one of which being the fact that the terrain doesn't load in properly, meaning floating machines and livestock, and your player falling through the ground.

There's also night-time, which is extremely, extremely dark, to the point where you can't see anything unless you change the settings of your monitor to the point where literally anything else will completely blind you.

There's lots to be desired here, the game feels empty, and the fact that you can't use mods in multiplayer without having to rent a server or host it yourself, which for me and my friends isn't worth it since we don't play often enough to warrant it, is to be honest, completely idiotic on the developers part.

As for the AI, it's improved alot from previous versions of the game, but it's still completely braindead, to the point where a 6-year old could do it better, it's not that fucking hard to back the tractor up and turn it around WITHOUT hitting the other one that's standing 20 meters from the field.

The building system is a good addition, it makes it feel more like you're controlling your own farm, and that's a good thing, but the fact that you can't place the buildings anywhere except on your actual fields, despite you owning the area you want to place it on, is completely fucking braindead.

Not only are the controls fucked, the steering feels like it's made up of cardboard, rubber bands and glue. It takes 5 solid seconds of holding down A or D for the machine to even react.

As previously mentioned, it feels empty.

In FS17, we had solar panels and wind turbines built in, where are they now?

We had lots more machinery and things to do, where is that now?

----------------------------------

I get it, you need to push the game every year, just like every other big budget studio to get the fanboys to steal their parents credit cards and go buy it, development isn't cheap, but come the fuck on, atleast put some fucking effort into testing your game, and don't release it when it's less than half empty of content.",1563561066,1563562455,False,3,0,0.488476455211639404,1,True,False,False,76561198059407754,273,12,2580,0,1761,1563917745,,

66,53987899,english,"I would highly recommend this game to those who are into farming, this game provides some amazing, new, more realistic and improved features that the previous versions, just wait for FS 21 to come out. Let's go over the pros and cons.

Pros:

Better game mechanics
New brands
Improved graphics. (best to set the graphics to medium and brightness to 0.8 for the best results)
The ability to create a farm from scratch. 
Revamped currency system
Weed improvements
Clean GUI
Farmhouses for skipping the night
New crops
Realistic scaling
Horses in the game without the need for mods
Realistic skies
A better in cab view with animations (I personally like using first person when driving in the new FS19)
Better bill payment system 
More vehicles and equipment
Improved yielding system
You now have to buy land to use it
You get the crop damage from driving over crops that you see irl, you know those rows where there was spraying or using tools on the field. That is now added if you do not use thin tires. Slightly a con that you cannot see crop damage with thin tires because even the thin tires would do crop damage irl.
Ok, so let's get onto the cons or problems with the game.

No seasons
No rules on crop rotation
You do not have to wait for crops to dry when the rain stops
You cannot see your body when you go in cab view. 
A few random glitches that happens here and there with the physics. 
Weight doesn't do much.
The removal of greenhouses. 

Overall, I would recommend this game, maybe they could make updates to the game to add a few minor things I pointed out. At least we have a greenhouse mod. You will most likely enjoy the game, if not there's FS17 which I have on console. But I use my new computer nowadays. GIANTS studio will normally work on their previous game, revamp it, add more, improve it and then get a more realistic and better Farming Simulator. For now I can just imagine how perfect FS21 will be when they make it.

I've played FS17 and that was fun but I feel FS19 is more realistic looking, I haven't encountered any bugs (yet). I can't see any significant differences besides the looks from FS17 but it is nice to see John Deere in the game. I really enjoy this game and it is a great game to relax to at the end of the day.

I really enjoy having  a game to casually derp around and build stuff without having to fight and defend.  It does require a little strategy if you don't want to go broke without using finance mods.  That said, this version has mod support built into it so you don't have to mess with unzipping mod packages into to game folders and that is really cool and convenient.  

The mission system is improved.  DLC stuff you bought for 17 seems to carry over or be available in the base game from the mod menu.  You get to do a bit of vehicle customization/optimization when you buy or rent them.  There are more crops and animals to manage.  The cloud/smoke/particle graphics are a better, but still need improvement.

There are some strange omissions in the list, and you will have to rely heavily on 3rd party sites to find some quality of life mods that overcome the terrible physics Giants continues to be plagued with - They really need to add a locking function to some of the forestry equipment so the claw doesn't drop things too easily or worse clip through logs!  

Giants also has stopped adding things directly to the game and now provides them as new official mods available in the in-game mod menu.  For multiplayer, this creates a few issues (see below)

For multiplayer, sharing mods - particularly as they get updated - is absolutely archaic.  Players can get SOME of the mods (only those found in the in-game manager) from a link, but it seems to be one at a time!  While I recognize the thinking - security issues - having an automated method of at least syncing the officially supported mods would be a godsend.  Adding a single-click method for downloading all mods - even unsupported - would be sensible.  At least some way to automate or simplify the system so players can keep up with server mod updates and new mods seamlessly.  Else they lose interest and simply stop, and we let the server rent expire.  Our solution has been to always feed the server owner's mods to a shared ""read-only"" Dropbox using a windows simlink.  We have not yet automated the download side of this but it should  be similar (most have stopped playing because of the hoops you have to jump through to get this done, and as such the server has been discontinued).  Working out a way to automate the syncing of mods between the hosted server and the owner's local folder has not yet been tackled, either, though it is minimal effort to do so manually.

You are going to use vehicles, aren't you? It's a farming game. You're gonna drive them in roughly 98% of the time.
Well, you are going to get annoyed by the constant revving of the engines, because the incompetent dev team can't fix a simple sound bug for 200 days.

[b] Today it's 2019.06.30 and it's broken since 2018.12.12. That is TWO HUNDRED days of ignorance. [/b]
I say broken because there were no problems with the ""day one"" patch.

What's the issue?

You hop into a tractor and start the engine. The Steyr CVT has a base rpm of 850. Pleasant sound. It's great.
Now, you move forward, and all you can hear is a monotonous screaming of the engine. How is that possible?

Let's check it with cruise control:

Tractor at idle, the engine is at 850rpm.
Cruise at 1km/h on flat surface: 850rpm
2km/h: 1372-1390rpm
3km/h: 1892 rpm
anything more than 3km/h: 1892rpm

So above 3km/h, there is no ups and downs based on performance and load changes. All you can hear is one, monotonous and annoying engine sound. Imagine that you are in your car, and from the very moment you accelerate over 3km/h, you hear the maximum rpm, that can be 3000,5000,7000, whatever. It's annoying and not healthy, right?

Well, you can expect this in this game.

It WAS wonderful, I played literally hundreds of hours, let's say 300 hours with the 1.1.0 version.
But ever since I bought it here, and they broke it, I only install it from time to time, to enter, create a game, buy the machines, check the sounds, exit and uninstall. It's broken AF, unplayable for me and definitely unplayable for audiophiles.


HUGE potential, nice implementation, but ZERO commitment to offer a quality product to the audience and ZERO communication.

1,52232837,english,"So, I'm biased a bit because I feel like Giants' business model focuses on them making money at the expense of the consumer rather than it being more of a mutually beneficial exercise. The game engine improvements are nice but often don't warrant having to purchase an entirely new game, new (or the same) DLC, and wait for modders to port their mods over to the new game.

SCS and their ETS2/ATS products have a much better, more fan-friendly model that's all about upgrading the game you invested in ages ago and paying for new content via DLC. With the various equipment licenses, mapping options and the like, Giants could be rolling in plenty of money without having to start over every time.

That all said, the latest edition of the game is ""good"". They didn't go backwards for the most part and added some much needed improvements to the engine. The visuals? Honestly, I don't see the difference (I've got a RTX 2080 and had a 1080 on FS17). Looks fine, bushes and trees still don't look any better so I don't see what the fuss was about. Ground still looks like same textures, etc.

However, there are some great changes: 

- Instead of the static animal sites on the map, you now place them with two sizes available for larger animals like cows and pigs.

- You can adjust terrain finally! Smooth out those weird mapping decisions made by Giants.

- Instead of  buying fields you now buy parcels that include 1 or more fields and other structures/sites. 

- There's a new contracts system which takes the old ""jobs"" system from FS17 and makes it more free form. You aren't currying favor to get fields at lower cost. You're just doing jobs like moving merchandise from one site to another and doing the usual field maintenance tasks as before. The rewards are not necessarily outstanding but they can be useful during the early game or when you have downtime and need the funds.

Meanwhile, there are things they completely missed despite the obvious logical step conclusion one would normally make:

- You can't remove junk/structures/etc. from plots you buy except for the base ""home"" plot you get when you first start. So there's this big chunk of land that has a fence and some broken down cars on it. Fun...but why? I can adjust terrain and sell starting structures but I can't pay a fee to clear some junk on my land? I can't buy a bucket for my wheel loader and shovel that crap off my land?

- The America map included in the base game is both insulting and frustrating at the same time: the place is run down like they picked the worst, most depressed part of the Rust belt and said, ""Welcome to America"". Meanwhile, it's more like canyon country than farm country. Small fields dotted around a plateau with a few big fields with windy roads barely able to accommodate a tractor, let alone a harvester.

- The train returns but in worse shape than before. At least in FS17 you could just leave the train wherever and be done with it. Now, the train automatically travels around the track whether you like it or not. You can still get into it and control it but if you aren't running it, it's trying its best to mow your equipment down as you get stuck because of the physics engine on the tracks. Yay.

- Horses are an interesting addition but they're overly simplistic and a big time sink. You can't use helpers in any way and the only way horses are valuable is if you run them regularly (ideally every day to maximize value increase). It's fun for a bit then it gets tiresome. You can only tab into a horse if you recently rode it. Otherwise, you have to head to the paddock and hop on again.  And instead of basic movement controls similar to your character, there's this acceleration system that puts the horse on auto at a particular cadence. It's awkward and takes away from the fun. It's not the end of the world or anything but I feel like the implementation is lackluster.

- Equipment and mods are like every FS iteration: you start with a decent if limited selection and modders fill the stable out. Giants has released some mods with old favorites and items you're used to but since they're mods and aren't paid for, it begs the question of why? Why not roll them into the base game? And the mods in-game (which tend to be safer than hitting up a modding site and hoping the one download button out of 20 on the page is the right one) are taking forever because the vetting process is slow, from what I've read. 

- And of course some minor quibbles are still there and still not addressed for whatever reason. For instance, my pet peeve is the fact that tractors shut off when you leave them. Hold on, you might say, there's an option to leave them on. Au contrare...it doesn't work right. If you go far enough away or tab through enough vehicles, they still turn off in that mode. You might say, per the words of the company, that it's a technological limitation given updates to active objects, etc. But then FS17 had a wonderful mod that turned them on and kept that state just fine. It hasn't come to FS19 yet (and may never, who knows?) but it's missed. Many a log has fallen from a logger because of an errant tab (you know, because Steam's overlay key combination counts as a tab in-game).

All in all (and this is the tl;dr part), it's a fine edition of the game. You get features you can use and the Europe map makes up for the lackluster inspiration of the American map (I miss that Montana map now from FS17...felt like home). The animal feature and terrain tools are big steps that are welcome but the horses and map design hamper what could be a great version of the game. Depending on your ideal price point, you aren't missing too much by sticking with FS17 if you have it and waiting for a sale on FS19. But if you really want those new features, you won't go too wrong by getting FS19 at this point. Plenty of mods have made it over and more keep coming.

44,52011603,english,"I have owned every Farming Simulator since 2011 till now.  The Focus has continued to make what I would consider to be small upgrades but overall the game has not changed.  They have added animals and new equipment which add to the overall gameplay experience.  
This version has been even better than the last visually.  Everything is shiny and the power washer is used very often to keep the equipment looking that way.  
Along with that, the vehicles have been more stable.  I have only tipped over the $400k sprayer a couple times to the point I couldn’t put it back on the wheels.  I do warn you though, if you reset the vehicles, sprayer, planter, ect., you will lose all the seed or fertilizer you had in there.  I normally use a tractor and tip it back over to save the $9k worth of fertilizer or seed inside.
The Land editing tool I do like.  It does cost a lot to use if you are flattening a large area.  It will create better land to cultivate and harvest or make flat space to build an animal pen.  I will warn you though, you have to remove any trees from the land and stumps as well.  If you leave any piece of tree behind the Land edit tool will not work and leave spires of land where you were leveling.
The grind is what I would consider more massive then any of the previous versions.  Cultivate, add lime, plant, fertilize, weed, fertilize again… Oofta… Just for one or two loads of grain that gets sold at a small price.  I would challenge to say real farming is easier.  Even if you shut off everything and have the game on easy setting, making a good amount of money will take hours to accomplish.  I’m 40hrs in on easy, and finally own my own large seeder, harvester, tractor x2, sprayer,  and 4 larger fields.  Hitting the 10 million achievement is going to take forever.
Would I recommend this?  Yes of course I would.  I am a simulation guy and this is one of these games that should be played if only for the experience.  
Pros
Graphics have been upgraded
Vehicle stability has been improved over other versions
New Land editing tool 
Better way to buy Land

Cons
Land editing tool bugs
Massive grind to gain money

The Good:
The new version of the store where you can see the equipment better before buying is kinda cool.

The Bad:
Logging has been ruined:
- The controls for the Ponsse Scorpion are clunkier than in 15 or 17 and it seems to glitch out and drop trees more often.
- The Ponsse Buffalo is a joke and handles like one, can't even pick up multiple logs reliably.
- The New Holland wheel loader with log forks isn't tall enough to put logs in the log trailer without collideing with the side, so you have to place the forks between the pillars to be able to dump the logs,which only works in certain places on the trailer where the pillars are spaced out enough. Overall this thing is a joke and they should have kept the same wheel loaders that were in FS 17.
- Barely make any money due to the land buying mechanics, can't use as a starting cash method anymore.
- No stock map includes a lake drop off point for logs like 15 or 17 had.

Less placeables than in  FS 17.

99,51232336,english,"The good:
Lots of brands.
They added a store where you can see the equipment before buying it.

The bad:
The gameplay has not changed much from the original 2009 edition, less so from the 2017 version.
Many vehicles have defects in their models, many unacceptable considering they have licences (Valtra N series has both electronic and mechanical controls, since its a reused model of FS17 that was modified).
Maps have horrible defects not present in older Farming Simulators, for example, rail track crossings actually sit over the road instead of in it.

The game calls itself a simulator despite having all models of reduced weight and filtypes that most of the time weight less than half of their actual weight, for example 1000L of water weight less than 600kg.

Game does not posses gearboxes as promised, this combined with the reduced weight of vehicles makes tractors handle like Go-Carts (mods have been built in the past for this, ignored by Giants).

Zero crop simulation other than the amount of times fertilizer is applied and weed control (which happens all the time no matter what). Weather does not affect crops, there is no growing seasons so you can seed and harvest crops at the same time, eliminating any sense of order in the game. ""Compaction"" is incorrectly fixed by using ploughs, a tool well known to generate compaction (both by reducing the soil structure and the building of plough pans).

Horsepower of any type of harvester does not matter, you will still harvest at the same speed no matter if you combine has 200hp or 500hp and no matter the size of the header. Same with balers.
In any type of work, the only limiting factor is speed, not throughput, not pulling force. Mods simulating this have been build in the past multiple times, but Giants keeps ignoring them.

Ai workers are still not smart enough to drive on the road or do anything other than field work.
Ai drivers still miss spots, get caught on trees, stop unexpectedly, turn in the wrong direction, etcetera.

Manure or any product put on fields can't be cultivated over if the field has already been cultivated.
Dedicated no till drills still remove every residue on the soil.

Graphics;
The ambient in general looks oversaturated with light.
Far away mountains look worse than a 2005 game.
Metal textures lack roughness and many look like base colours in sunlight.
They couldn't even fix the problem of rain falling through roofs of buildings and vehicles, it basically rains inside the cab.
Wipers are just plain moving sticks, there is zero interaction of rain with windshields (a feature present in basically any car or truck simulator in the market a few years ago).
Crops look very spaced, nowhere near the density of a real crop. Same with grass.

A friend of mine who sells Ponsse machinery laughed at the way the Buffalo handles logs, IRL the machine can pick and load multiple logs in one grab with utter precision and force. In game the machine can barely grab one log, and the log tends to slide and glitch out of the machine, the claw has no force at all.
At the end forestry machinery ends up being frustrating and unrewarding to play correctly.


I could keep on going, however all you need to know is this is not a simulator, and don't expect nice graphics anyways.

5,51369164,english,"Before I talk about FS19 I would like to say something about FS15. FS15 I really enjoyed. I played the game so much and when I found out they was coming out with FS17 I couldn't hardly wait. When it was out I loved the game even more than FS15 and put a lot of hours into that version of the game too. So when FS19 was getting ready I thought man it just keeps getting better and better, right? Well NO, it was like they took a very good game and just trashed it. I mean I could do some field work and make $40K (FS17) maybe more and it would be long until I could upgrade my equipment, in no time at all I could have a nice lineup right? I place on the map for the farms? They look like crap no place I would want a farm for sure. There was a lot of things added I could care less about but not a problem if you can turn it off. Did a cotton job and when I was done it say I still hadn't finished the field but I did, so the only thing I could do was cancel the job, then it took 119K because it said I had missing crop. Signs every place! You can't drive far before hitting one or two of them. The highest paying job I got so far was $26K and that was potatos. We all know how long it takes to do one of those fields, right? Start rain at one point 15 minutes before there was even any clouds in the sky, then it stopped about 10 or 15 minutes after it said the sun was out again. The graphics was so much better in FS17 than FS19 I think. Have you noticed that even though you don't make money doing field work the equipment pricing seems to be the same??? It would also seem that mods ether don't work at all or has all kinds of problems in FS19 tried Courseplay and wouldn't do the fields right, and that GPS mod is the worst mod I ever had to try and work with, I gave up on that. If I had one wish it would be that they would make to versions of FS19 one that is closer to FS17 and the one they have now, I know I can't be the only one that isn't happy with FS19, I go back to FS17 and hope someone will come out with a better game than FS19, I give up on FS19 it isn't fun anymore.",1561164176,1561164287,False,7,0,0.539179742336273193,0,True,False,False,76561197990998508,8,1,27413,0,17066,1586580023,,

8,45907596,english,"Now that the new 1.2 patch is out with landscaping, this game is much more enjoyable then it was before. I would now recommend this game, and it is a lot less frustrating with this new feature. I would give it a 7/10 instead of a 3/10 now. Here is what I wrote and what the game was like before the patch:

I pre-ordered this game about three months before its release. When I first jumped into the game, my heartbeat was 180, and I was so excited to see what this new, highly anticipated farming game had to offer. I have played every Farming Simulator game since the release of 2013 (including the mobile versions), but this game by far, is the worst one I have ever played. Keep in mind that what you find below is mostly my opinions, but there are a lot of facts, and/or I am doing something wrong in the game.

When I loaded up my first game on Ravenport, there was a few things that I just hated. I am playing on the ""Farm Manager"" mode.

The first thing that really got me frustrated was the new system for buying fields. When you start on the ""Farm Manager"" mode, you do not start with any land, you do not even own your farmyard (which is empty), but instead have to buy the farmyard, AND the field north of the farmyard if you want the whole thing. The land is ridiculously expensive and if you want the whole farmyard on the mode that I am playing on, you have to buy two pieces of land which drains about half of your starting money. Additionally, if you want your farmyard to look like a farmyard, it would take all of your money to actually create a normal looking farmyard with the farmhouse, sheds, etc.

Another thing that really got me mad was how the land gets flattened out when you purchase buildings for your farm. I love how it flattens out the land, but I tried to place a building and it put it like five feet off the ground, and there was like a 50% grade that I had to climb if you want to get on to the actual area of the placeable. I ended up selling the placeable but the pavement for the placeable was still there, and there was no way to flatten it out.

I tried using the four wheelers for loading seed and fertilizer, but it is really hard to get the trigger right for when you can dump in. I spent five minutes trying to load the seed from the back of the Mahindra into the seeder. Sometimes the trigger is on, but you have to press the unload button fifty times before you actually get the back of the Mahindra empty.

Most people haven't realized this, but you have to buy the animal pastures and they are expensive too. It is like 40k for a chicken coop and 300k for a horse stable. This isn't really a technical problem, but just one thing that I wanted to point out. If you play on the hardest mode, you would have to put in about one hundred hours before you could get a decent number of fields, stables, etc.

The dogs are honestly so bad I wish that they weren't even in the game. When the dog walks, it looks like it is having a seizure. It does not go after the ball, and it does not adapt to the terrain very well. I also really hate how in the CGI trailer they showed the dog in the vehicle with a farmer and I cannot figure out how to put the dog into a vehicle in the game. The dog doesn't fetch the ball when you throw it either.

One last thing I wanted to point out is the trains. The trains move at like 50mph and the railroad crossing bars aren't even down all the way when the train passes the crossing. I ended up getting hit by a train with combine, and went flying in the air, which made me really frustrated.

These are only a number of the plenty of issues that are in this game, but there are mostly good things about it such as the graphics, birds, and a number of other things.

I would personally not recommend this to anyone who is looking for a complete farming game. This game contains a lot of issues that would need to be fixed for the game to be somewhat substantial.

My honest review in comparison to FS17: 3/10

This game is just an update to FS17. It is not worth the $35 right now.

Despite all of this, GIANTS is great, so I am sure that they will be releasing a patch for this in the future. Until then, I will not be playing this game very much and will be sticking with FS17.

first things first is it wurth the money :s hmmmm just not. why ? here is why in the previous version thing were cleear about the seed and stuff and also what you could and needed to do and it was easy to pick up on.
now even with the tutoriaal when you switch to the game you have to figure out som stuff like the seeds and i dont mean in the seeder but in the menegent store screen because there is only figures.

i like how they did setup the menegement screen i only wished it was stil under i like porevious versions
also the stuff they added is great compared to previous version those where pretty limmeted to seeds and stuff to do.
is it fun yes probebly.

its also a pitty when i look at all the versions it seems liek they add somthing good but take out another good thing and just take out that special somthing that made the specific version so enjoyeble and with every new version its gets less and less fun sadly enoughf

Silage for quick cash is no longer profitable, or worth while. For a bale which is 4000, you'd get on average of £2,100 for 4000 of soybeans you'd get £2000 or more depending on a spike in the market, but considering that in ""Real time"" it takes too long to harvest grass then row it in lines, then bale it, then wrap it, then collect it then sell it. This extra effort use to be worth the tedious an long task in FS17. But now its Save time and cash on equipment for just simply planting soybeans hire a worker.  Thats Plant - harvest - sell, for the same reward which saves you 20 to 30 minutes of in game play.

I wait until the game is loaded, then plug the controller in.  It has a couple other minor glitches, but don't all games have glitches?

I see a lot of people who upgraded from version 17, and they are not impressed.  Well, I upgraded from version 15, and it was well worth it.  So, I am comparing it to version 15.

It is a bit harder to play than version 15, as you can't just go around mowing every ditch row on the map and make silage out of it, you have to own the land before you can mow it.  You also have to work the soil more, fertilizing twice and needing to control the weeds.  I like that because it adds realism.  I also like being able to lease equipment.  It also has a sleep mode, where you can go to your house and get some sleep.  I like this because I don't have to wait four or five minutes for night to pass (at 120 x time mode), it passes in about 10 seconds.  Being able to work for other farmers is cool, too.  (my grandpa used to have an 80 acre farm with more equipment than he needed, so he used to either hire out to other farmers or rent land from other people)  And being able to start from scratch (no land or equipment, just money) is very cool.  I wish someone would get around to adding the Farming Classics expansion pack, it would go well with starting from scratch.

So if you like FS 15, you will like FS 19 even better.

56,48654854,english,"If you like the previous Farming Simulator games, or this type of low paced peaceful games in general, then you'll probably like Farming Simulator 19 as well - just be aware that the game remains very buggy and has significant performance and stability problems, much more so than previous games.

New stuff in FS19 is that the ""normal"" (aka Farm Manager) and ""hard"" difficulties now start you off without a pre-made farm; you merely get a bit of money and have to buy all the necessary machinery and place all the farm buildings yourself. This means you no longer have a stable/pen for each animal type that you can't get rid of, but instead have to place them wherever you want them. New is also that you can keep and breed horses (max 16 at a time though), and to feed the horses you can grow oats (or you can just sell the oats as any other crop). Also new is the ability to grow and harvest cotton, but it works just like every other crop in the game.

The actual game has however not changed much or at all since the previous releases and the majortiy of the new features (like dynamic hoses, the train driving around the map on its own, or chopped straw from harvesters being visible on the ground) are simply taken from mods for FS17. The additions do make the game more ""real"" and add to the atmosphere, but they are all minor visuals and have no actual effect on the gameplay.

The most noticeable changes gameplay wise in this version is that there's now 2 fertilization stages instead of 3, weeds will grow in all crops (this can be disabled) and have to be sprayed with herbicide to improve the yield. You also have to apply lime occasionally (this can also be disabled), and whether or not you need to plough the fields depends on what crops you grow on them. Should be noted that the AI helpers refuse to spread lime on a field that is fully fertilized, despite the game telling you that the field needs lime. The overview map is a little better at telling you what needs done to improve yields, but despite the visual changes to the menu with better sorting of the shop, it remains clunky and requires a lot of clicks to get to  the information you want.

The 3D preview of what machines in the shop look like before you buy them is a long overdue improvement. It lets you spin the machines around and updates as you change colours and configuration. Just be warned that this feature does however has its own performance problems and in certain cases the game will crash when changing the configuration on certain vehicles - like changing tires on a tractor. The way you buy stuff in the shop has however not improved at all and requires a minimum of 3 clicks/button presses to buy anything, AFTER you've decide what to buy. Since you can only buy big bags and pallets one at a time and have to approve the purchase of every single one, this terrible design very quickly becomes frustrating and it is mind blowing that anyone at Giants thought it acceptable.

The most grevious problem with FS19 remains the way it handles maintenance of the equipment. Although slightly more realistic than the terrible system in FS17 - machines now wear down and have to be repaired at a workshop rather than having a recurring incremental cost for upkeep - everything simply wears down way too fast to the point where the machines are worn completely out and become practically unusable after just a few (in-game) hours of use. 
Even on small fields this means you have to either use equipment that is much bigger than realistic, or use multiple machines at a time doing the same job (which the game doesn't handle very well), or you have to stop work multiple times to repair the machines. Considering how small fields in this game actually are it is ridiculous that things wear out so quickly and I highly doubt the manufacturers appreciate their machinery being depicted as not being able to handle working even a single small field before it has to go through major repair or replacement, but just as it was with FS17, Giants refuse to acknowledge that it is an issue and won't do anything to change it. Should be underlined that the idea is fine, but the implementation is awful and everything wears out about 100 times faster than they should.

It is obvious that, just like FS15 and 17, FS19 was rushed out  and didn't receive adequate testing or bugfixing, or any testing at all. Not only is the game much more unstable than the previous versions and will happily crash or lock up at the slightest error, especially in multiplayer, but the new engine has atrociously bad performance. It only uses a single CPU core and even on maximum graphics settings barely uses the GPU at all. The result is that the framerate is all over the place and often dips heavily for no apparent reason, while changing the graphics settings have no noticeable effect on framerate at all. Rather weirdly the framerate dips the less complex the image is and go up the more complicated it is for the GPU to draw. Meaning, standing still looking at a bunch of buildings with no animations will typically cause the game to drop to 25-30 fps, while driving through a dense forest with trees that cast individual shadows usually can be done at 60 fps with the GPU practically idling. Even stranger, the hardware load usually goes down along with the framerate, which is the complete opposite of what you'd expect. It does however mean that running the game with more powerful hardware has no effect on the performance because the engine simply doesn't work properly. My GTX1660 Ti is practically idling while running FS19 and the CPU barely does any work either, and yet the game very rarely comes anywhere near 60 fps and more often than not sits at 30-45 fps, which is only playable because the machines move so slow anyway, though the low framerate makes it difficult to steer properly when driving on the road.

On the visual side of things, the machines look amazing and nearly all the new equipment added to FS19 has dynamic hoses and more animated parts than the previous games. Everything else, like ground and building textures, are however of very low quality and looks ridiculously bad for a 2018 game, and only underlines that they have not improved whatsoever since FS13. Animations remain glitchy for many of the machines and when objects have to interact with each other, like picking up logs or pallets, it can get really bad with logs flying across the map and pallets that are glued to the forklift.

Despite improving the lighting of the game, many of the machines now have lights that don't work properly. As example, turning on the worklights on certain machines (like the NH forager, the Agco Ideal combine, just to mention some) will make the light cones disappear completely, which in turn makes these machines unusable at night because you cannot see a thing. Like with nearly every other problem with the game, Giants say this is merely visual and refuses to fix it, despite of how severely it affects gameplay.

Edit: We're now looking at 7 months since release and I just want to say that although Giants effectively refuse to fix any of the issues with the game, it is very much playable despite of how poor the overall quality is and how terribly designed some of the features are. This game truly is years from being ready for release, but just as has been the case with the previous games, Giants won't take the time they need to do it properly and will instead release a new game in 2 years, that will have minor fixes and even more problems.",1548887461,1559068321,True,11,0,0.607085466384887695,0,True,False,False,76561197998143434,339,31,122047,774,6068,1601142455,,

But the game will improve over time as Giants will work to improve the game more with updates/patches and there will be a lot of mods coming out for fs19 like in fs17.

Here are some of my pros and cons from my own experience of playing fs19 so far:

Pros:
- Updated graphics 
- New brands and some updated tractors.
- New animals (Dogs and horses).
- New crop types such as oats and cotton.
- Better engine sounds for machines.
-Weeds and birds ""hanging out"" in your crops.
-Building your own farm.
- Ability to change most equipment color to a color brand of your choice.

Cons:
- Night and day cycle seems to take a while to appear and transition.
- Not many options for placeables. (although many mods will be coming to take care of this as well as in Giants own modhub).
-No option like in FS17 to open and close doors and other things with the click of your mouse like in for example, in the Estancia Lapacho fs17 platinum DLC map where you could open and close the doors of the house/garage etc. (in the fs19 version of Estancia Lapacho the doors of the house and garage are all open).
-Buying pallets of seed and fertilizer. Giants should have included standard in the game a seed/fertilizer tank like in fs15 and below. (But this has been fixed with mods that recently came out on various fs19 mod hosting sites).
- Placeables are sometimes buggy in not wanting to be put down in a specific part of an area and even next to each other.
-Not having roads to get to various placeables that are placed down.

All in all, fs19 is a good game. It still has some bugs to be ironed out.

I searched up some streams on Twitch, wanting to see how people actually played the game, and I watched a guy filling a silage clamp for 45 minutes, talking about his day.
How I went from that, to purchasing the game - I don't know. But here we are, over 300 in-game hours later and not feeling a natural stopping point. I've purchased a complete setup - steering wheel, pedals, two joysticks and to top it off - a newly revived YouTube channel where I post my gameplay.

FS19 is the follow-up to the smash hit FS17. This time around, there are some new crops, a couple new maps, and, what feels like, less equipment. Would I recommend this game? it depends on what kind of player you are. Let me explain.

I think if you're new to the FS franchise or skipped 17, you should pick this up. The starting maps will give you tons of playtime.

But if you are a returning FS17 player (like me, over 300 hours) then it isn't that simple. It mainly depends on how you played 17. If you spent tons of hours on the stock maps and using stock equipment, then this game will most likely be fine for you. 

Now if you played less than 20 hours on each stock and modded map on 17, I can't recommend this for you. Currently, as of May 2019, there are only a handful of really good modded maps for the game and not very much equipment. Though you can find more of each on other websites besides GiANT's own mod hoster, the good mods are few and far between.

TL;DR: If you're new to FS or loved playing the stock FS17 maps, get it. If you only played mod maps from 17, hold off until a sale or more mods are released.

Landscape editor needs some serious work. Only can edit certain areas and can't remove trash on Ravenport. It sucks.

Much less content than FS17... One Lowbed trailer? What happened to that orange one? All the cool old tractors were left behind in Fs17 too. only one older Case in 19'. You'll need a effin' load of mods to even scratch near what Fs17' had out of the box.

The two included maps are okay...but imho are incredibly lame once again comparing to the previous games...

This was at best a trivial upgrade from FS17 and I have been playing FS since FS11. Not worth the cost.

-TOTALLY UGLY!!  reset vehicule if you dare, and some of em simply LOSE KIND OF GRAVITY..  ITS FLOATING,  and became almost unusable.  
-POTENTIAL IS HERE.. YES!!  that game could be very fun, very interresting, BUT..... DAM BUT@!!!  its a pain in the ass!
even with steering, and fully equip, controls are everything BUT precise.. UGLY!!!
all crane controls are unintuitive, way far to be used like a true double joystick like on real engines.  

-the only way to really get fun is with MODS...   yes MODS... you need MODS to get fun...WOW!!!   mods are fun, but NOT THE ONLY OPTION TO GET FUN ON A GAME DAMNIT!!!!  it so look like the only way to get more interesting content is by adding mods!!

-Icons...  lot of Icons but NO HELP if i can say it..  memory, you have to remember what icon mean what to be able to play properly!  not even hovering mouse give a hint..  NO HELP!!!

-Vehicule controls are just okay on keyboard, but TOTALLY UNPLAYABLE with steering.. wtf, why adding steering if you need to move 70-90 degree before seeing your wheels move an inch!

devs seems lazy to my opinions..  try it if you dare, but you will want a refund fast!   after all those sequels, this one is a SHAME!!!!

I really like the new features of cab and seat suspension, but almost everything else is just horribly integrated into the game.

I am starting to think that Giants are just some lazy sons of B-words, and lay everything in the modders hands, to create a game, that's enjoyable. Mods like seasons, GPS and the gearbox mod, should ALL have been part of the vanilla game for FS19, but weren't which is just too bad.

I probably won't buy FS21, or what ever it will be called at that time, unless Giants really get their shit together, which they really need to do, after this mess of a game, that also shouldn't have been rushed as much as it was.

Some things id like to see is. 
1) since we can hire workers, Id like to be able to do more than 1 mission at a time.

While I hate that the helpers are so stupid, it does add a bit of realism to the game.  How many farms are manned by completely competent employees?

It's essentially Farming Simulator 17, but worse

The only decent things so far are Cotton & Sugar Cane being in the base game. Also graphics have a had an overhaul since FS17, the game is gorgeous but that's pretty much it for the pros.

Content wise, there's hardly any equipment; there's actually less content in FS19 than there is FS17 which I don't see why they though to do that. Any new content is added as Mods using the Modhub or from DLCs which gets annoying to keep track of.

72,50019176,english,"I came from FS17 with high expectations, but it rapidly became blatantly obvious that Farming Simulator relies upon the good will and efforts of the modding community. Even with the few mods currently available for FS19, I'm essentially playing a vanilla version of the game. No real physics, no real weather, no seasons. Only a small handful of maps available, to bolster the 2 maps that come with the game. For me, with FS17, it was a way to pass the time, thinking about life as I nurtured my crops, but there was a diverse stockpile of mods to make things slightly more realistic. 

FS19 suffers because the modding community hasn't been able to transfer their FS17 mods to this latest version. And for me, that demonstrates how little Giant/Focus actually do to create a fantastic game. Farming Simulator definitely relies upon the unsung heroes, the people who don't get paid, to create content for a very basic game. It's as though the devs had a meeting and said, ""Real mud? Real physics? Real seasons and weather? Nah, we don't have to do that. That's too much like hard work. Let the modders do it for us.""

In truth, FS19 has the potential to become a great game (the graphics are slightly improved over FS17, and there's the option to start from scratch and buy tracts of land as you increase the size of your farm), but without the modders, it's not worth getting if you already have FS17.

98,45927615,english,"Updating as of March '19 - Pre-ordered this game and posted an initial review at release.  Lots of positive changes since then.  When the game first came out mods were few and far between. 
 But all that has changed.  Here's my breakdown - 

Pros:

- Detail.  The level of detail put into the equipment in this game is remarkable.  I really like the effort Giants puts into these games on that front.
- Mods.  Lots of mods
- Tons of different types of maps you can either install from game or get from the internets.  
  Large fields, small fields, combo of both - whatever you like.
- Tons of different equipment
- Passive income mods are now available too (greenhouses, windmills, beehouse, etc)
- Multiplayer - this game is a lot of fun to play when you have other people to play it with.  
  Don't get me wrong... single player career mode is perfectly fine in its own right.  But it is fun 
  to play this game with others.
- They have John Deere in this game (although somewhat limited)
- Fendt Ideal - if you've ever had the privilege of seeing one of these beasts in person, you'd  appreciate the level of detail in the game on these combines.  Easily my favorite.  
  The Massey Ferguson Activa being a close 2nd.
- Music - you can listen to different genres of music in the game.  I like that option.

Cons:

- I am a big fan of Agco, and particularly Fendt brand.  They don't (at least not yet) have any 
  Fendt   balers, sprayers, windrower, forge harvester and a few other things.  It's entirely 
  possible maybe someone made one or some of those available on a mods download site 
  somewhere.  Haven't looked there.  Would like to see them available in the game mods 
  menu eventually.
- Hired Workers - If you've played past FS games, you know you can hire workers.  And 
  maybe it's just me, but they just seem pretty dumb unless you're on a perfect square field.  I 
  wished they were more intelligent with working fields because there's a lot fields that are not 
  going to be perfect squares or rectangles.
- Traffic.  Cosmetic of course, but the traffic in the game is completely oblivious to you.  I find 
   that annoying and often times end up turning traffic off.  Wished there was a little more logic 
   to the traffic given how many maps have streets nearby fields.

If you've never played a farm sim game before but the idea perks you're interest, you're not going to go wrong with FS19.  This is a good game - if - it's something you are interested in.  I have quite a bid of mods installed, mostly directly from the mods menu in the game (some downloaded from websites) and I've never had any crashes or bugs or any crazy crap interrupt my gaming time.  Its been pretty stable for me.  I should point out that I don't use a wheel or other peripherals... I'm totally keyboard/mouse and perfectly content with that for now.  

I would like to see Giants build upon the career mode side of this game in the future.  Take sports games for example... there's an actual story your character follows as they build their skills and progress.  I'd like to see Giants incorporate something like that (optionally) for career mode.  Maybe you inherit a farm from a relative that passed and it's a bit run down, has old equipment, some of it broken or in need of repair.  And you start out rebuilding what once was; and eventually work your way up.  But part of that would include interaction with other NPCs - perhaps with reps at a farm machinery show or something.  They do have different career modes you can start in but from an immersive perspective they are all lacking.  Doesn't make it bad per se, but I think it would be a neat addition if Giants were build on those in the future.

17,47189682,english,"The jury's still out on this one. 

It's Farming Simulator sure enough, but it feels rinse-repeated (no change there) and has launched with a lot of technical issues that are rapidly making Giants look like they aren't even testing their new releases before dumping them on Steam.

First off, this is NOT a simulator. It's a game trying (poorly) to simulate. There's an important difference!

It looks nicer, with a new shader running on their ageing game engine, but still falls short of the mark when it comes to graphical technical know-how. It has all the hallmarks of a Giant's designed game. Back in the early days there was a rumor that the dev's were originally engineers that decided to make a game. It shows. Every item is technically oozing with detail, from implements unfolding, to fine details in the vehicle models. But the overall graphical artistic talent is lacking, leaving the landscapes feeling dated and lackluster. 

Their use of modern rendering techniques feels messy too, with some details looking excellent, while other distance rendering techiques look like a game from the late 90's. When combined, it delivers a mish-mash that doesn't quite come together properly. For example: Blurry distance textures on boundary areas (to give the impression of Depth of Field), with regular in-game trees that are clearly in sharp focus, with no shadows. It looks cut'n'pasted and honestly, very ugly! Why can't they just use Bokeh like most other games that attempt similar visuals? Only Giants know the answer to that one.

I can't help but think Giants need to employ some proper graphic artists and developers to bring this game into the modern day, before it becomes a laughing stock.

Having played this game for many hours with my wife on a dedicated server, I can confidently report that some of the equipment needed doesn't work as you'd expect either. A simple example is a long trailer that is designed to collapse down to cater for vehicles and implements, so the player can transport several items over long distances. This sounds excellent in theory, but in practice it's a disaster waiting to happen. Often the trailer bottoms-out on invisible bumps in the road along your journey and catapults anything it was carrying into the direction it was travelling. Even inspecting the road that it's stuck on reveals nothing restricting it, leading to the thought that it's a collision box on the terrain that's been left unoptimized. This is a classic example of Giants not even testing the [i]only[/i] trailer of this kind available (at the moment), on the roads they themselves designed. Simply raising the trailer height would solve the problem.Very shoddy!

Another example of broken implements are the KUHN items that have been added from what I assume was FS17's DLC pack. It's nice that they added them, but again they are more problematic than anything. The 4 part seed box, plow, harrow, seeder set that all connects together, only adds to complication when using an AI driver to work the field. Sometimes it's hard to even change the seed setup, but the most common problem is the AI randomly changing direction at the end of the field if you've had to refill it part way.

Terrible AI programming! Honestly, if this is the kind of AI our future holds, there's no way Elon Musk need worry about AI taking over the world, because it would probably try to download itself into a kettle and boil itself..

Finally, the physics. There's no change from all previous farming simulator releases, no matter what the fan-boys try to tell you. I picked up a pallet of seed, only to have it glue itself to the tip of the front loader forks, refusing to budge. When I decided to try and lift it, the pallet raised slightly, then catapulted about 20 feet into the air, as my wife and I laughed, awkwardly, trying to hold back our frustration at the stupidity of the physics system.

It's a game with a truly love/hate connection. Which is a shame, because for me at least, it used to be a labor of love to work a farm. Now it's becoming tedious as I work around all the old gripes, 10 years on.

I'd usually recommend this franchise, but not this time, as I feel Giants need to take notice of the unhappy customer base.",1543506953,1553008785,False,17,3,0.491358339786529541,0,True,False,False,76561197970719873,445,43,19427,0,5590,1588463460,,

Pros-
- 19 has slightly better graphics than 17
- 19 allows you to edit the terrain and reform your land without a mod
- 19 added horses, which is pretty cool
Cons-
- I only have 1 real con, 19 has a different platform making it more difficult for users to create and edit mods, because of this there are far less mods available (only so far hopefully), also because of this, some of the available mods have bugs or just flat out do not work. It's been 4 months so far and no seasons mod yet. All of the great mods from 17 like, seasons, real tire dirt, real ground response, courseplay, follow me, farming tablet, gearbox, more realistic gameplay, proseed, gps, and other great mods, are not available for the 19 version.

This game is in the shadow of FS17 (in my opinion). To me, its a re skin, however FS19 has a touch better graphics, and a bit more machinery (minus the John Deere brand installment) that's it.

 I've been playing your fine game for a while now, and enjoy it fully.  My biggest issue / question for the developers is of a serious chicken related matter.
 First thing, could there be an option when near a chicken, that would say "" pet chicken""?    So then, the chicken would come towards the player, and be held, and or do a little dance to let you know, it understands you are there...
  Also where do the cardboard boxes, and packing tape come from. Are we led to believe that our fine feathered friends are gathered around, boxing these up?....    If so, it must be asked "" Why are the boxes greasy?"".    These are the things that keep me up most nights.  Many hours have been spent, pondering the great eternal question:

The Good:
The graphics are better than FS17... marginally
They added weeds and lime requirements
The mission system is much better (no time requirements)

The Bad:
The bugs are varried and vast.
The maps are horrible- 2 years of development and you hand us something Bullet Bill can make in a week?
There's still no seasons- seriously WTF how can they not have seasons by now.
You're still ""painting fields"" theres no ground response- aka wheel slip going up hills ect.
The fruit animations are the same/ the loading /unloading animations are flat and look like you pouring a liquid picture of potatoes.

All in all im very dissapointed in Giants. They should be ashamed to put this out. Especially after seeing what the mod community on FS17 can do. It's like they took FS17 base game shined it up and slapped a ""BRAND NEW"" sticker on it, and they know it'll sell because of the faithful mods who will make extrodinary mods like seasons, gear box and ground response. Giants plans on making money off someone elses hard work.

They could have spent money, hired the modders from FS17 and had an actually good product. I would Gladly pay $60 for the above listed mods to be a base option in the game.

I'm  giving this POS a thumbs down. Back to FS17 I guess... Untill Bullet Bill can make a real map and the Seasons modders can get their mod working.

I can't belive I bought this.


Update 3/9/19

Still a shiny turd.

Mods have made the quality of life much better now.
There are less bugs now, even though bale/ log physics are still ridiculous and stock log grabs are under powered and unable to actually grab any thing.

66,49419823,english,"I have played many of the previous versions of the game and I must say, the most playable is still FS 15.  FS17 was released way before it was a polished product and to this day still has unresolved issues with crashing and hired workers not doing what they are supposed to do.  Now FS 19 is out and the state this game is in is almost unplayable.  

You will get the farmboi's claiming the game is fun, but there are so many issues that just break the game, it isn't much fun.  

First off lets discuss their shipped maps.  These are just stupid.  Almost all farms have huge piles of garbage on them that cannot be removed other than editing the map and removing them totally from the game.  Who wants a farmyard with huge piles of scrap iron in them?  These maps also have the ability to put many ""placeable"" items in them, (which is required if you are starting from scratch), but WHERE you can place them is severely limited.  If you cut down a tree, there is a 90% chance it will block you from placing anything where that tree was.  Furthermore, the distance with which you can place these items seems to have an excessively large ""no build zone"" around each placeable object.  This will, under many situations make building placement very awkward and restricted.

The shipped US map in now way shape or form emulates North American farms.  This farm looks more like something at the foothills of the rockies, NOT the grain belt of the US or Canada.  If you're going to emulate the primary grain production of the US, get it right!  When is the last time you have seen mountains in Oklahoma or Texas?  Seen any mountains in Kansas or Iowa?  The way that US farmland is depicted is almost insulting.  They seem to think that the US is still living in the dark ages.  I have seen farms in the US that would dwarf anything in this game. 

These maps are also pooly designed when it comes to placement of items.  For some reason, power poles are placed every 30 feet which makes getting around the map, awful.  So many of the poles are placed so close together that you cannot enter the field with the larger combines with an attached header since it doesn't fit between the power poles.  Where I live, there are ZERO power poles any more.  There are the huge 3 phase lines and the major production lines that connect the substations to the production facilities.  The lines that go from the substations to the various farms are all buried and have been that way for over 30 years.  The telephones lines have been buried for more like 40 years.  Is Europe that assbackwards that they are 40 years behind?  I find that hard to believe!  

They still have not fixed the woodchippers, since they seem like their ability to grip and pull tree's is very lacking.  The least amount of drag causes the tree to stall and not enter the chipper.  This has been an issue all the way back to FS 15 and it's still not addressed in ANY of the previous releases.  The physics that effect trees is just awful.  When pulling a tree with the Ponsse Scorpion, the tip that touches the ground swings around and slides sideways with such ease, it looks very stupid.

Ahh, but the machines themselves are correct right?  laughable, they are not even close.  Most of the combines have a turning radius less that half that of their real world counterparts.  The steering on these vehicles is just horrid.  Using the mouse and keyboards with factory settings makes the game unplayable.  There are settings in game to lessen these delays somewhat, but they fall horridly short.  

Best way, edit the game files (yes the ones they tell you not to), because their settings in the game are nowhere near real life.  I have had to edit every vehicle that I use on my farm to bring them into their real world counterpart specifications.  I think maybe their game testers are pet monkeys!  No quality control managers I know would ever publish anything that is this far away from what they actually are.  It's not inventing the items, these items already exist, have known parameters and controls.  But Giants seems to think that they can just splat on a bunch of stupid parameters and settings and no one will notice.  Uhm, there's a ""new"" thing out here in the real world called ""Google"", maybe have the devs check it out?

Hired helpers, oh lord, these guys are so broken!  They are constantly stopping their harvest with  ""Unknown reason"" and the only way to get them going again, is to hop in, and driver the combine again for a fair chunk of the field until the ""Hire Worker"" function will actually work again.  Furthermore, they very often will leave strips at the end of every field, and sometimes refuse to harvest the last 6 foot strip along the side of a field.  ""Helper X has completed their task"".  Uh, there's still half a mile long 6 feet wide!  

Now it is very obvious that these devs have never visited a US or Canadian based farm.  Land in Canada at least as well as the US is laid out using latitude and longitude.  As such over 90% of the land is laid out in ""quarters"" .  This means that most fields in North America are laid out in half-mile by half-mile fields.  Perfect squares.  Hence the basic land descriptions  ""SW XX XX XX WX"" (Where XX is the numbers that designate the land location). This is what North America was founded on.  The fields may be different shaped due to various hills, valleys or water (Sloughs, lakes or rivers), but the base field is square, always square.

European fields may be helter-skelter and unusual shapes, but North American fields are based on squares.  Canada uses the metric system, which is bloody stupid.  The country was drawn up and divided up by miles and even takes into account the curve of the earth with ""Correction Lines"".  

Farmland in the US and Canada, for the most part has very few fields with only 40 acres or less,  They may have crops at that size by subdividing a quarter section into several fields, but the fact remains, your base ""Field"" in the US and Canada is 160 acres (quarter section or a half a mile by a half a mile).  The US map never reflects this at all, as all fields are hap hazard and chaotic.   

On a side note, the game is constantly suffering from micro freezes, crashes, and freeze ups.  Hopping between many vehicles using the map eventually starts to disable map commands, such as ""escape"", ""enter vehicle"" and ""hire worker"" which will shortly thereafter cause the game to freeze totally disabling everything and causing the player to be stuck in place unable to move, open the map, or open the purchase interface.  These issues seem to get even worse if you install mods such as coursePlay.  CoursePlay has it's own issues, but at least it's devs are attempting to fix it and are constantly releasing updates via GitHub.  Giants?  Not so much.  

I have since quit playing FS 19, since it's just frustrating having to constantly hop for one field to the next starting hired workers that have quit working for ""unknown reason"".  Some of the larger maps out there, (mod Maps since the ones that ship with the game are just lousy), have over 60 fields, so as your farm grows, the amount of microfreezes approaches that of totally game breaking.  Having  vast amounts of machinery working in the field with hirelings means microfreezes about every 5 seconds or so.  The game starts to stutter so much, you have to turn it off.  

Also having even 30 fields and trying to maintain all the machinery with spraying, cultivating, fertilizing and harvesting, just causes so much hassle with hired workers stopping constantly just causes frustration.  Sometimes the hired workers do strange things like driving their machine way off the field in a straight line, veer way off course.  These instances are usually followed very shortly by a complete game crash, lockup or parts of the GUI locking solid

And I've always loved the game and this one is no exception, Graphics have been improved well over what all the others have been but that is about all. It has more glitches in it then almost any game I have ever bought out of the gate, and if they would give me a ""REFUND"" I would take it...
I've played a number of maps in it besides the 4 default maps and they all have the same problems.
#1. Even if you own the whole map I time and again end up with the message ""YOU DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO THIS LAND"" not allowing me to harvest trees that I own, or even mow grass...
#2. Even on a logging map ""Black Mountain Montana"" for one I again ran into the above message. And even after harvesting over 200+ trees i trued to plant a new stand of trees after clearing the stumps it came up. ""TO MANY TREES TO PLANT HARVEST SOME MORE""??? On a Logging Map and this has happened on all of them as well.
#3. Again on all maps once you place your animal pens and put in your animals you can not feed or water them for at least 8 days..
#4. Even though your chickens will generate eggs where the cartons of eggs are put there is supposed to be a pallet for the eggs to be put on as they are produced, ""BUT"" No pallets are put into place making you have to load them onto the trailer or into your truck manually, Unless you place a pallet there yourself first.
  I will give them one thing they do continue to put out mods but mods are useless unless the base game works properly.
  They need to quit putting out content and just fix the game,,,
  I've tried contacting Giant's and they said send us your log file and we will get back with a solution ""BUT"" Big Surprise I've heard nothing back from them.
  I am going back to FS 17 while it may not be as polished at least it works and is more then playable.

This game was born on PC and now the inevitable shift has happened. That shift is when a PC game gets big, supported by community mods that make it what it is, the dev's switch focus to console where the money is at. This has unfortunately happened to FS. I am bored beyond belief. The new graphics are lackluster and cater to console performance. The draw distance is pathetic. Many objects do not render until you're about 50m away and there's no option to change this even with a high end PC. On release the economy was broken along with the outrageous cost to buy land. Some fixes have come but still finding it very uninteresting. I can't explain the graphics but they just look washed out. The equipment is bright with clean lines and no real definition looking out of place on the bland backdrop. Like everything is toy and made of plastic. All I can say is that to me it certainly looks different than 17, but not better at all. 

The default maps are catered to the Euro farmers. Small, clustered, bendy, obstructed curvy layouts with tiny fields. There is an uninspiring amount of equipment for purchase. Nothing new and exciting as far as I can tell. Was excited to see Mahindra but the only vehicle there is, is a stupid UTV. Mahindra makes tractors but there aren't any in the DLC.....

23,49020753,english,"This was my first Farming Simulator game, so I can't say how it holds up compared to the rest of the Farming Simulator games.  What I can say is that this is an okay game.  It's very overpriced.  If it wasn't $35, I might have recommended this as a fun time waster for people like me, causal players.  I don't know how hardcore players who stress about having giant fields and tons of money can do it.  I nearly throw my laptop across the room trying to harvest a small field because at least one vehicle gets stuck on the smallest incline. 

There are a lot of problems with this game.  First, the physics are terrible.  I went into this knowing they weren't good, but didn't expect it to be that big of a deal.  It is.  It makes driving a pain in the butt, because there is a decent chance you'll end up getting one or more vehicles stuck somewhere.  Although I've got to admit, driving my tractor off a cliff to get to my farm was the highlight of that save file.  I took like no damage.  And did this several times.

Another big problem is driving the vehicles.  Without attachments its all fine and dandy.  But the moment I added attachments, certain necessary maneuvers were a pain.  Is it realistic?  Yes.  It is still annoying?  Yes.  For example, I had to back up against a barn to sell the hay bales I had.  Took me like 30+ minutes.  I would've left, but I'd already spent waaaaay too long getting the bales all packaged up.

There are also some annoying bugs.  Or maybe the helper AI is just complete garbage.  I've had them plow like half a field and say they're done.  And yes, I had the money to pay them and there was nothing in their way.  But when the helper AI does work, it's really useful.  

Also, small note, the weeds are crap.  I liked the idea, but in reality it was poorly implemented.  I'd have fields at 0% weeds, turn around to go do something, and within minutes it was at 100%.  I swear it goes from 0% to 100% randomly.  The only time I saw it less than 100% and more than 0% was after spraying weed killer.  A few spots were at like 1% or something.  A little warning would be nice.  Weeds grow fast, yes, but they still take time to grow, and you can see them growing before they're the size of your crops.",1550286603,1550286603,False,1,2,0.472727268934249878,0,True,False,False,76561198162642123,70,8,1322,0,1322,1547498796,,

37,48953760,english,"I wanted to like this game, I really did, but it has so many problems that ruin the experience (for me at least), and left me utterly disappointed so it's just not possible. It has some nice features as well, i can't say it's all bad, but there's definitely more negative than positive here. Okay.

First of all, the graphics. Even with all the settings maxed out this game still looks like a work-in-progress. Some of the machines have nice details though, but the environments, buildings, cars, and pretty much everything else looks just plain unfinished. Not cool. I know that graphics don't make a game, but in this case making the game look even ""ok"" by 2018 standards, would be nice, especially in a game that's supposed to be very immersive and realistic. 


Physics in the game, i have a big problem with. You see, in real life, heavy machines like tractors, logging equipment, harvesters, trucks, and so on... are big and heavy. In the game, some of them handle like a three-wheeled go-kart. Try loading a logging truck full and drive it to the sawmill, you'll see what im talking about, the whole thing wobbles left and right like it's drunk. Controls feel wobbly and too fast, like you're driving something totally different than you actually are.

Another issue is with the logging parts of the game. Like big equipment, also huge logs are heavy, but in the game you can toss them around like tiny sticks, yet despite that, the crane in the forwarder is unable to pick up more than one log at a time, this is highly unrealistic (maybe not if you'd have a smaller forwarder, but with big ones like the Ponsse Buffalo or the Komatsu in the game, you're not supposed to have issues like that) and makes for a seriously annoying gameplay. 

I know you're supposed to mod the s*** out of this game, and so I did. Better maps, better equipment, more stuff, this and that. The best mods would be the maps, since the original two maps are just plain boring and uninteresting. I liked the ""Grizzly Mountain"" logging map, and the ""Michigan 2.0"" farming map much much more than the originals. I also downloaded a mod to make logging more realistic, and while it definitely took it in the right directions, it wasn't right enough and the physics issues mentioned before were still there. It made some things nicer, sure, but not enough. Bummer. 

Surely, there must be something positive as well? Yes. The amount of equipment available and the number of functions they can do, is pretty nice. I like the detail of mud/dirt on your equipment the more you use it on the field, it's pretty much the only nice visual thing in the game. The gameplay can be ""ok"" at best, it's not bad, but my expectations were so much higher, and no I don't thing they were too high.

I operate forestry/logging machines in real life and I was really looking forward to seeing how it was all created in the game. I was left very disappointed. The farming bits of the game are slightly better done, if that's all you want to do then the game can ALMOST be recommended, with heavy modding of course. Wait for a sale. 

All that being said i must add that I really hope Giants improves this game in the future, there sure is potential for a great game. Please put more focus on logging, not just adding more machines, but the physics of the logs and the features of the machines themselves. 

My overall score would be a 5/10 (the game in it's current state and without mods), not recommended.

This is a great game. Much better than the previous game Farming Simulator 17.

Pros:

Great graphics

Many implements and animals to choose from

3 different gamemodes to suit your style

Many great and detailed vehicles

Landscaping/Teraforming

Cons:

Some controllers/wheels dont work, but it will be fixed. (FIXED)

Alot of hate, but its the same idiots who hated on Spintires: Mudrunner, another great game.

Placeables dont always work, but can be fixed by using Place Anywhere mod.

62,48807262,english,"I have stuck by the side of Giants since FS13. I have made multiple maps for each since then as well, and while I feel that the series has always taken big steps forward, FS19 has taken some steps backwards. 

The placeable system has completely ruined map making and game immersion. Who the hell wants to have 300 cattle in a .25 acre plot of flat (big emphasis on flat) ground. It just doesn't work near as well as the old way. Why change it if it's not broken? Oh right, console players....

Aside from the modders perspective, this game just feels rushed. Released with bugs and literal errors on Giants end that they seem to refuse to take seriously. There has been an audio bug since day 1 in server play. (Very annoying). They have done nothing but push out old content from 17 into the mod hub. However, I will commend them on the terraforming update, that was a very welcome addition to the game. 

It seems that they have began catering towards the console side of things, forgetting the platform that made them HUGE in the first place. Pushing this ""e-sports"" nonsense like it's some kind of sporting event. FFS Giants.... it's farming. 

In conclusion, I do not recommend this game at this time. Wait on them to fix it, wait on them to give us content that should be in the game from the beginning. Don't support this growing trend of money hungry devs who do not care about you. Especially since this game has taken a turn towards more console friendly, dumbed down, ""e-sports ready"" gameplay. 

TLDR- Giants is focusing more on pushing out content rather than fixing the glaring issues that have been there since day one. PC players are the last of their worries now as console oriented gameplay has ruined the series, IMO.

Forestry is possibly the most fun out of all the things you can do, additionally it's the best quick profit. It's fun turning the whole country side into a complete forest. These pine trees can grow nearly anywhere, even grass will do. 

Negatives that i noticed is random stuttering every second. I can play this game in highest settings at reasonable FPS, however from time to time the game goes into a complete unplayable lag hell. I don't know what's causing it, i did many things to fix it but none helped, it's a bug for sure. It's really hard to tell what is causing it, usually it starts to happen when using any lifting machine... since i do mostly forestry i get this quite a lot. Secondly the game pad should receive a lot more attention in this game, In ""Euro truck simulator 2 "" it is fully adjustable and easily you could control the turning speed sensitivity and all other things. It's a small feature which could improve the game beyond words. I keep crashing into things i should've never crashed into, because i have barely any control over a game about basically drivable machinery!
Graphics are good but for those trying to finish off a massive field quickly and straightly, i would like to give an advice... don't strain your eyes with blurred together textures, and so turn down the texture antialiasing. 

Verdict, well, It's a game still, but I'll give a 7.5 out of 10. why not 8.5? If they fix the issues above it would be quite a lot more fun.
The pricing for this game seems a little over the top at the minute, it has the looks and feel to it that's good, but it needs work on improving the interface and some serious look into bugs, that have potential to stop the player from playing all together, it's very annoying at it's best as it happens randomly.

I must warn you that this is heavily mod reliant, you will have much more fun when you load the game with user content.

The downside to this game is much like many other simulators, they have very little driving you.
Once the initial startup is done there is no challenge, nothing is going to come ruin your crops so that the bank loan causes parts of your farm to be repo-ed  there are 3 maps that the game provides you with, and each has a few points that you might sell crops at. However the games economic difficulty never truly challenges you. if 1 location sells too cheap the other is normally fair. at the hardest setting the prices leave a small margin for profit but i never find myself selling anything at a loss. Certain crops are always more profitable than others the market has no real demand built in to stop you from over producing the same crop over and over. Do not get too excited for horses they have many problems. first being that you buy full grown horses at 5k$ then raise them by caring for them (very simple) and riding them 5 minutes, doesnt matter how fast or where or if you jump or not,  nothing you do matters just 5 minutes on them.  then after about 8 days of care they sell for 50k$ 10Xs the money with minor costs and a painful time sink.

repair systems are also lacking go ahead and repair stuff from time to time but its just clicking a button there is no tires flat or blowing an engine simply your repair bar is low pay money.

I still recommend it for a bit of fun if you have some friends willing to try the multiplayer can be enjoyable share a farm or split into teams trying to buy up more of the map race to 100 million dollars or something of the sort.",1549227802,1549227802,True,1,0,0.520547926425933838,0,True,False,False,76561198080874292,34,4,18776,0,14687,1586523866,,

For now I keep on playing FS17 with - amongst others - a good working Courseplay and keep FS19 on the shelf until the modders have upgraded their fantastic mods. Unbelievable Giants does not realize the impact of some mods on the value and playability of their product, rather disappointing... These modders deserve more recognition. A lesson for me before I ever buy a next FS edition: wait a year or so after a new release until modders have written their new scripts.

ADDED 3 Feb 2019: a beta of Courseplay has been released (apparently with - too late -support from Giants), but it is an utter disgrace that Giants managed to mess up the setup of the only controller made specifically for FS, the Logitech/Saitek G Farm Simulator bundle, and in-game command shortcuts appear for some Playstation controller instead.

There are a bunch of negative reviews that are for specific things, yes the game could use a lot of updates and added content that feels like it's just flat out missing. However I suggest using ModHub, it quickly replaces things that are missing from the base game. (I have 16+ mods running regularly) I never saw myself as someone who would ever sit down and play ""a stupid farming game"" however, my cousin let me play it for a couple hours on his PS4 and I was instantly hooked. I bought it on sale for $31.99 and it is by far the best and most thrilling game I have. Thrilling? Yeah, it is slow paced but the dopamine comes flowing into your brain after selling that large harvest you've been working towards. I only have 2 worlds, the first one was learning the controls and basics of the game, then messing up cause I decided to lease things and went broke. The second was on Farm-Manager and I am doing better than ever. I have also learned things I never knew in real life. I never knew anything thing about farming, let alone even planting a plant. I now understand the different steps in taking care and improving your yield and what the animals eat and how a farmer were to go about their days.

3,47248996,english,"TL:DR - While I say I recommend the game, wait to purchase it. Wait for Giants to fix some basic quality of issues, and/or for mod support to be in full swing. Bugs are minimal, gameplay is always smooth and satisfying.

UPDATES: They have updated the game some, AI is still horrid but atleast now we can paint terrain and terraform. Which definitly helps bring immersion into the game, you can make your farm actually look like a farm. Still some minor irritations from me though, it's almost like Giants is just relying on the modders at this point to really make the game, espesially with placeables. Like come on, give me a proper default hay loft or some variety in tractor storage sheds.

The game looks amazing, a definite step up from previous titles. The lighting is probably my favorite added feature to the game, and the random wildlife, more random outdoors sounds. It really makes the game feel alive to me, which FS17 lacked.

It plays very well, bugs are few and far between, while the number of brands is down this time around, the vanilla equipment availble is much better than FS17 in terms of usability for my play style. The incoming mods are very promising looking, Giants really stepped up their game for supporting modders. Which in my opinon is a gift and a curse, sometimes it feels that Giants kicked their feet up for some features and said ""eh, the modders will fix it, leave it broken for now"". But in my honest opinion, I think it's time for Giants to move to another Game Engine, on that is more 2018. They are doing great things wtih this older engine, but it's time something new.

The games AI somehow took a giant step back. Which is wildly frustrating, because by default maps now have odd shapped fields, and the AI has ZERO idea how to handle it. They just, in many cases... fall off a cliff. It is my number one gripe in the game at the moment, it makes it very difficult to multi-task. Also still has the issue from FS17 when the worker only uses 3/4 of the actual workign width of the implement it is using, which means wages are higher than they need to be, diesel usage is higher also.

Physics are less than... perfect. Sometimes it feels like they didn't even play test the game. Tractors get floaty steering and will drift pulling empty trailers, skid steer falls on it's face lifting more than 100 pounds, which makes loading flat beds with pallets and such a fight.

Default maps feel slapped together, liek they are a tech demo with a couple good photo spots and LOTS of empty land, which makes it feel barren. Which is another bad point, the game still has the ""bubble"" for view distance. It's a solid option for people that have low-mid PC's, but for us with high end PC's, it would be nice to increase it even more.. without having to alter an .ini file. Also the whole ""build your own farm"" thing, what a disgusting mess and waste, it's a hap-hazardly thrown together feature. It's useless in my opinion. The 3 default maps, all only have ONE, yes ONE starting area realistically, unless you want to start your farm in a field. Also note, there is no vanilla way to pave or change the ground to cement or dirt, rocks ect.

Still no dynamic ground... this is 2018... oh well. The painted flat textures look pretty 3D, but having real soil simulation would be such a treat, and open so many more gameplay doors. Especially if seasons was a thing *cough* *cough*

Other than those gripes, I think this is a solid step forward in the series.

They were too gamey, too repetitive, not really simulators at all, and lack many aspects that would make them enjoyable immersive games.  FS17 was a baby step in the right direction, but not enough to garner more than a passing bit of play.

Farming Simulator 19 is a giant leap forward in playability and immersiveness. Is it perfect? Not yet. But the addition of placeable buildings, terraforming (still rough), and the beautiful graphics make it so much easier to suspend disbelief and immerse oneself in the game's universe.  The out of the box maps are beautiful and while still smallish and with limited ""environmental interactions"" (no access to most buildings, NPC people and vehicles run in continuous mindless loops, and no real NPC interactions), they take you into the setting and get you feeling like a farmer much more than any other game in the franchise.

I have only played a limited amount of time (42.4 hours at this writing) and I still have many many more things to do in the game before I have exhausted my interests.  The learning curve is a little steep out of the box, and the help is really limited, but thankfully there is a huge community to support fellow players and most answers are just a quick search away and a video or two on your favorite video service.

18,48393251,english,"I've given positive reviews for all Farming Sim games up until now. As soon as I loaded the game the first issue I encountered was the mouse sensitivity, I can't remember this being an issue for me in the older versions of the game. But on this one even upping the sensitivity on my mouse was still nowhere near enough, as I still needed 5 swipes of the mouse just to look 360 degrees. You'd think that a game would have a simple mouse sensitivity slider, but no. I had to google it and found out I had to go into the game files and change it manually. Something which really isn't fun to do when you've just bought a game you want to play.

The game is still very 'Clunky' the Vehicles still drive and manoeuvre like some old game made in the 2000's. Something I noticed straight away when driving, is that wheels no longer auto straighten. Making things like reversing trailers way more complicated than it needs to be. I feel that was a move for people who use steering wheels when playing. On mouse and keyboard though it doesn't feel right, as every other game I play with Vehicles the wheels straighten up when letting go of 'A' or 'D'.

Although the game does have a handy help section explaining how most things work. It is very vague, and I tend to find myself resorting to YouTube and Google in search for answers on how to do some of the basic things. I was hoping for a search feature in the shop, as with 102 brands and hundreds of different types of vehicles and equipment. When you see a trailer that requires an 'SB100' to use, I'm expected to go through those 102 brands or the 20 odd vehicles tabs to find it. Something again that isn't fun to do for everything you buy.

It does play and feel like I'm playing the exact same game as FS17. It does have some cool new features. I'm a big fan of the smaller details, like having your character use peddles when driving to break and accelerate and bounce on their seat when driving over rough terrain. Birds on your fields. You can enter your house. These are just small cosmetic things in the game, but I can always appreicate the small details. I do like that now you buy land rather than just fields, having the map cut up in to tons of sections you can buy is a big plus.

I have experienced a few bugs, for example if a field needs sowing or something. I'll sometimes hire a worker to do it then go afk. Then when I come back the worker has for some reason decided to just keep driving and ends up on the other side of the map, all whilst still charging me the workers fee. When I return to my field only half of it is usually done, so the worker just decided to go for a drive. This has happened quite a few times for me.

Contracts have changed. In FS17 you would start a contract, teleport to the field you chose, and have all the equipment there ready to use. Now, you have the option of using your own equipment to save money, or you have to pay to lease the vehicles to do the contract. I paid to lease as I didn't want to drive my harvester all the way to the other side of the map. I expected the Vehicles to spawn at the field like in FS17, instead everything spawned in the shop. So I had to drive a Harvester, header, tractor and trailer across the map. Once the trailer was full I had to empty it at a selling point, again on the other side of the map. I had to do this twice. Point is, I spent about 45 minutes doing a single contract worth just £3,500. Minus the £400 lease fees. So the contracts become a waste of time, unless you pick a field next to the ones you own or next to a shop.

I must be the most unlucky person in the game aswell. Considering I'm on my 24th ingame day. With Wheat, Barley, Oats, Canola, Soybeans and Sunflowers all at, or just under the 100,000l capacity of my Silo. Out of those 24 ingame days not a single one has had a high demand at any of the sell points. I've had to survive on Eggs and Bailing alone for all those days. I don't think I can fault the game on this, I assume I'm just really unlucky with the high demand spawns. Pretty frustrating though sitting on hundreds of thousands of pounds worth of crops which I'm waiting to sell.

Overall the game is still worth a buy if you liked FS17, as it's pretty much just a reskin of FS17 but with some slightly better graphics and a couple of new farming methods (Sugar cane, Oats, Cotton etc). I'll most likely still put hundreds of hours in to it like the older versions. However, my reason for not recommending it is the complicated cluttered menus, the odd bug and having to leave the game to search up things. I just felt disappointed on how little the games changed from FS17. And that basic things in the game that have annoyed many of the players in the previous versions weren't addressed or improved.

I've played all kinds of simulation games in the past, but this is the worst kind.  I knew from reading about the game that it was not going to be your typical ""big picture"" sort of simulation.  I actually looked forward to the likely monotony, thinking it would be calming and zen-like to plow fields and tend to my animals.  But NOTHING is streamlined or automated and you are required to do every frustrating minutia.  I'd even be okay with the forklifting (as I mentioned above) if the game automated it's placement on the back of a trailer.  BUT NO.  You have to place everything EXACTLY right or it all falls apart.  In fact, I've actually driven a forklift in real life.  That was easier than trying to control it in this game.

There is a thousand different tools that attach to only specific machines and no clear indication of what fits what and how to utilized anything properly.  No guidance, no clarity, no help (the help files are useless).  I did the tutorial level, and it basically just stops helping after a few simple tasks and you are left to fumble around and try and make something happen.

If you are some kind of masochist who likes being put through sessions of agonizing pain and torment, you might like this game.  But I'd still recommend you find someone who would be willing to just kick you repeated in the crotch and save yourself the $$$ from buying this awful game.

This game also requires very specific video cards to run.  I tried to run this on my laptop with a powerful, yet off-brand, GPU and the game just freezes during load.  Nvidia on my desktop worked fine.

I was surprised by all the positive reviews  . . . Then when one identifies the same words in the same pattern, from the same country posted within a few minutes of each other, it not hard to see the Giants paid for positive reviews.  It more than obvious when people connected to Giants start making reviews.    All we are saying is that when you get 500 positive reviews from the same town in Finland, we kind of get you game.  It shitty and you paid for good reviews.  

This is probably the worst of the Farm Simulators I have played from Giants.  The whole game is buggy.  The physics’ are outrageously bad.  I have seen the Lizard Truck and tipper full of wheat go flying half the map for no apparent reason.  Pallets of goods do the same thing, I not been able to find where they land.  The forestry aspect is buggy. I had a portion of a log in the tractors claw, the tractor was tipping sideways, and shaving the ends corrected the problem. The AI tends to skip when planting, plowing, and harvesting.  The red implements to to skip when planting, even with seed. 

The brakes,  Giants has a thing against brakes.  99% of the trailers in the real world have breaks and will slow down in sync with the vehicle pulling them. 

The roads are pretty tight and winding, expect to get caught up on everything.

I AM NOT ONE OF THEM.

 




to put it simply you have to be a major masochist to enjoy this game with trash AI and controls that make you want to die.

This game is slooooooow like really sloow it is quite litterally press button and wait then do it again then again then again and then one more time then repeat the whole damn thing again on the next area. (harvest, plow, seed, fertilize) which is still a step down from weeding and anyother bullshit you need to do for some crops. OH AND DID I FORGET THAT SHIT DEGRADES WITH TIME? making using AI a nessessity and thats if your doing ONE small land.

Forestry is done through buying land and choping trees this  can be done buy hand but is better done with machines. Sadly the controls for this game are some of the worst i have ever seen in the last decade. Meaning you stuck with shit controls or a painfully slow and trash payoff.

did not even try my luck with animals...

game gives you a guide so you can TRY to learn but its trash IMO

honestly this game is sold as a kinda chill and in depth look at farming but it is so far from that its not even funny.

whenever i play this it feels like im managing a small fucking island you can play with friends  to help with that but who the hell can get their friends to buy a 40$ sim game with almost nothing to really do.

the snowballing of money is paced at a crawl. Ever spent a few min doing boring shit for retturns of around 4%... no? well lucky you.

the game has a lot of diversity so it gets points for that but you cannot  really spread out and do more then one thing IE lumber, animal husbandry, crops (which have around 8ish types each needing one of a few types of machines)

Though I like the content GIANTS produce in their Farming Simulator games, and I have loved playing their games for many years, I would not suggest purchassing this game, because there are so many bugs and glitches within this game, most of which have not been (and wont be) fixed. You might say that they have a ""Bug Reports"" forum, but trust me, there's so many bugs that they'll never get to your one, so there's no point trying! I have a bug that means the grass flickers on all maps appart from Ravenport, so I've basicaly lost all faith in enjoying the game in the future.

Along with this GIANTS' way of developing is very irritating, because there will be almost no updates from now until the release of their new game in 2 years time, so dont expect much new content because they rely entirely on their player base to make mods. The only piece of new content will be their Farming Simultaor 19 Platinum Edition, which I have never seen the point in buying.

I'm sure that I would love their content, but its just never properly or professionally finished, and then after release not enough changes are made to fix these problems.

Just keep the change! Buy a [b] FINISHED GAME [/b] !!!

Pre-order DLC was a joke, useless in-game and ended up being moded.

I find the game very unoptimised. It really needs to move to a different, much powerfull engine! You can also tell when you go to configure you graphics settings that from the options its not as up to date. I believe Unity would be a good engine for this game.
The game doesn't seem to take full advantage of the hardware and having the foliage setting increased so you dont have a render bubble arround you just tanks the fps... and im using an i7 with a 1070 & 16GB RAM... ive seen people with 1080s complaining too on the steam forums.
I feel like the game is very heavilly rellying to its modding comunity and Giants realesing old assets of the game at the Mod Hub.

MULTIPLAYER... possibly the most disappointing, yet enjoyable part of this game. Very harsh on performance, ancient sync system and theres a noticable input lag ( no matter what server you are on ).

79,48215801,english,"As far as the machinery side of things goes, it's a good game. The graphics have improved but I have seen much more realistic natural textures in other games so a little dissappointing there. As stated in other reviews, the fact that modders can come up with fully animated tractors inside and out and yet giants haven't is a real disappointment. It seems once again they've gone for quantity over quality. I personally would sooner have 1 tractor for small, med and large classes that is fully animated and interactive over many that are not. As far as the helpers go, they have improved slightly in the sense that most of the time when they encounter an obsticle on turn around at the end of a paddock they will back up and find another way around it. I personally haven't had any issues with odd shaped fields as I usually do the first couple of laps myself and then let the helper take over. But that's just me.

One thing I do like about FS19 is the fact that you can actually start off with nothing, although I do personally believe that it should be optional to start with all the fields planted. I'd prefer to start with everything grass and weedy and just start from scratch. As far as what others have complained about with having to start with nothing, Giants need to include all the relevant paperwork as far as field area, implement usage (seed, fert, etc...), hourly fuel usage per vehicle etc.... 
Fortunately some people have already done that in the forums so I managed to get a field area chart, seed and fert usage chart and a rough yield chart. Being a farmhand myself I just treat it as I would any other farm and do all the math before I start. Work out machinery hire costs, how much seed, fert and chemicals i need for each paddock and then go for gold. Before I started doing this though, I failed miserably every time so I can see why the city folk would complain about not being able to jump in a tractor an make heaps of money straight up.

My biggest complaint about FS19 would have to be the fact that it's called farming simulator. The game is mostly just another driving sim with a few added extras to keep people happy. If it's going to be called farming simulator it should take into account the animal side of things as well. Not just the super basic stuff that has been included.
I can't speak for europe but very few farms in Australia would have a fully automated dairy system where cows just walk in on their own to get milked. Most are either small scale swingovers or large rotary platforms for the bigger farms. 
With how customisable this game has been made for modders, why they haven't made animals and economy more accessable is beyond me. 

If any modders feel like implementing the following please feel free to :p
Things I would like to see:
More custom dairy options, nothing over the top. Just simple options rather then the usual lely robotic crap.
To milk cows and shear sheep it costs money to hire someone. Should be the same here. eg: notification comes up saying cows need milking or sheep need shearing, press a button to trigger a simple animation of cows and sheep lining up to enter the building and a worker gets paid to do it.

Which leads me to the next item on the list, there should be an option to set a realistic pay rate. I managed to find some code to set my workers to $30/hr but have to insert it into every hirable machine. On a 1:1 time ratio the speed per acre works out damn close so $30/hr works well.

Roads should be hardwired into helpers like the paddock area to allow helpers to pick up a harvester from the store and drive it to paddick 12 for example or go unload at the mill etc...

As stated in other reviews, GPS needs to be implemented. Have it as an added option when purchasing certain machinery.
Bale counters on the balers would also be a nice touch.

The option of animal husbandry. Put a bull in with a cow and it pops out a calf, ram in with a ewe and out pops a lamb etc... Can't remember, but disregard this if it's already in there for FS19.

The option to fence off paddocks (separate fencing options per paddock that cost money) and allow paddock rotation for livestock. Rather then have to hard feed them all the time, have the option for fenced paddocks. 1.5acres of grass per cow per year, not sure on sheep, and placable water troughs with some sort of auto fill plumbing option. have to maintain paddocks as usual, cows actually eat the grass in the paddock and paddock gets fertilised at the same time.
walk up to the cow paddock, option comes up and select move X amount of cows from this paddock to that paddock etc... allow splitable herds. same with all animals.

The option to input realistic weather data and produce prices for a players' local area. Input the players local weather site and it just updates the weekly forecast every time the player is online.

Irrigation options. plants don't grow without water. Here it rains for half the year, paddocks get closed up to grow and then harvested once the weather warms up. If there's little rain through those 6mths then it's a bad harvest and feed needs to be purchased from elsewhere to get through at full production capacity etc... 

I haven't looked into it yet but as grain prices go up and down with demand, so should purchase prices. I think they already do but I'm not yet certain.


All in all it's a good game and quite enjoyable when played right however, if you're someone who simply wants to ""play farmer"" for a couple of hours and make lots of money I'd suggest go back to an earlier version.",1547082278,1547082278,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198031505217,46,4,6828,0,408,1590896255,,

Animals: I love the changes they have made to animals, it really does make the decision making whether to be a completely arable farmer or a completely livestock farmer a harder one to make. It is arguably harder to get into, but that is part of the game experience in my opinion. 

Land: I love that the plots of land are not just the fields anymore (like they were in FS17). It makes it more of an accurate look into farming. You don't just buy the land that you harvest from, you buy the surrounding fences/pieces of grass as well. Something that could be improved here is adding in a way to lease land, as I constantly hear farmers mentioning that they have a mixture of owned land and leased land it may be a bit more realistic... (the farmers I mention here are YouTube based so take that for what you will). 

Machines: Now there isn't anything really ground breaking here, but as I said, this will be filled in by the modders as they continue to move forward over the next couple of years. Already a lot out there considering it has only been out for a short time and over the holiday period I would suggest that the modding community will continue to impress moving forward.

9,48070986,english,"First, let me clarify the Steam 1.2 hours on record.  I play in offline mode so obviously they do not pull time from game files.  Also this does not include the numerous hours in Giants Editor and scripting as I would not review FS without looking researching game as well as tools.

I have played FS for many years and am welll aware that Giants has poor Quality Assurance in their software releases.  FS19 has exceeded even my expectations for their lack of proper testing.   The list of bugs is quite extensive, the lack of logic in gameplay programming and basic decision making (i.e. changes to tractor sounds) show the product was rushed to market with little testing.

Tractor sounds are unrealistic and mimic that of a 2 cylinder 4 cycle.  The change from FS17 sounds to FS19 is dramatic and quite unimpressive.  

AI workers have never been a strong point in FS, however, after years in the development cycle it would seem they could get this point right.  Now they have implemented illogical gameplay design of trying to have traffic stop as tractor, harvester, etc approaches.  The traffic however will stop in path of equipment causing an abrupt course change.  Again, poor testing combined this time with illiogical design.

The implementation of landscaping was tossed into game in recent update again with not much design thought and testing.  More of an appeasement to the console crowd to allow for their ill-designed placeables system.   A subset of GE tools were thrown in-game with no proper instruction to those unfamiliar with GE to allow for very simplistic terraforming.
The biggest problem is no testing or design for the back end of this system such as how to defeat obstacles such as you can't perform that function in this location.

The grand new additions to FS19, dogs and horses are about as simplistic as a mid-level MS-DOS game.   The dog does nothing.  You can pet or throw a ball, the latter of which disappears into ground and dog remains fixed.  No testing.   Horses can be ridden when they stop glitching and sliding around long enough so you can press key to get on them.  Oh what an experience it is to ride these gems.  Not.  If you implement new gameplay then at least test and make these experiences your focus.  

Oh and cleaning your horses, you press a button and hear a ""hairspray"" sound.   No curry comb, no brush, no apply blanket, no wash just a wonderful whoosh.  Cleaning over.  The total experience.  Awesome.

Giants Editor is still in Beta 8.1 as 8.0 was beyond usable.  The 8.1 version is workable but any great new features.....nope.

I understand this review may sound harse, but the fact remains that Giants chose a money grab over quality.  I enjoy FS gameplay as well as modding for FS however if something is substandard I would be as critical of myself as this product.

10,48069922,english,"This is a great game, can't wait till it's out of Beta. At least, that's what it feels like. Unfinished and unpolished, requiring a second screen so the player can navigate bugs and glitches.
There is a lot of great things to celebrate in FS19, The machines exhibit an attention to detail that is very pleasing. The ability to have your favourite internet radio feeds or mp3s play through the vehicle radios, and the well crafted maps are just a few. However, this is interrupted jarringly by pallets getting stuck on forks, horses that do a little bunny hop before the jump animation, Horses that climb sheer cliff faces (horses in general really).
The economy feels haphazard and random (tautology?). Graphing the changes in the prices of comodities in 12 hour increments heralded no discernable pattern. This feels like a missed opportunity as there is no real gauge on what to plant and when based on the market values, which is especially true because there are no seasons. That's right, no seasons. I was especially suprised to find this glaring omission from something with the word simulator in it's title. True, I'm not a real farmer, but arn't seasons a major part of farming? Here, plant what you want when you want with no consideration to anything. I often find myself inventing reasons to plant one crop instead of another. Once, I accidently planted oat instead of Barley and it is of absolutely no consequence.
There are three main flaws with this title;
The bugs and glitches. Some of these have been fixed and hopefully this process will continue.
Missed opportunities. There are many times in this game when I was left shocked and thinking ""why is that not in this game"". 
Nothing to react to. Except weeds. Vehicles don't break down, animals never need a vet. Everything is linear and predictable. So much so that I was excited when I found out that a horse's final day of training gives less value gain than any other days (oddly, this is due to the linear nature of value gain) Yay, something I can optimise by not following the script.

All that being said, FS19 is a nice experience. The progression is slow so each new purchase feels meaningful. The machinery is detailed and wonderful. The new landscaping feature allows for some beautiful farms to be created. Harvesting a big field listening to music or an audio book is relaxing and satisfying. The biggest upside of all is the modding community, those wonderful people working hard to fill in the missing bits, complimented by the ease of adding mods to the game.

The game has many hiccups, things that are weirdly missed, and has a 'do stuff and you'll progress' feel. But it boldly strides beyond this and presents as a really good experience. Its strengths outweigh its anchors and, as the developers and modding community work to make it more than what it is now, it can only get better.",1546523458,1546523458,True,15,2,0.642545878887176514,2,True,False,False,76561198025356094,90,2,10211,0,4382,1591879157,,

The game isn't perfect, and those errors do make it frustrating sometimes (clearing my last field of trees so I could expand it was a real chore and not fun at all).

Classic farming sim
Updated graphics/light engine (very nice)

Cons however,
Not that many new machines (however mods make up for this on PC)
Land is VERY expensive. On Ravenport a 10HA field + the land around it is 800,000, making starting from scratch a real grind.
Land deformation needs patching, when i first started without knowing it costs you money, a placeable worth only 100,000 cost me 380,000 to place on a surface which was relatively flat.

Overall, good game, nice peaceful way to kill lazy hours on a sunday morning, but without mods the game only really has one leg to stand on.

FS19 offers a small graphical improvement, the addition of john Deere, but the removal of several other useful implements, trailers, etc. from the game.   The workers are bugged, and the number of placeables to ""make your own farm"" is worringly low.

Give the game some time to be patched, and for the mod community to fill in the holes that exist in equipment on release.   Until then just buy FS17 as it will be more enjoyable for at least the near future.

I have played farming simulator since forever. It's never been a game that feels complete, its raw and direct on what you do and what you get, still is pretty addictive and well aimed, until you eventually get tired of doing the same on its slow gameplay.

With the pass of the years you would expect plenty of changes and upgrades, but honestly, Farming Simulator seems stuck in time, basicly being the same game, release after release, with some minor changes that have been or could have been done with older versions and using mods. This latest version is no exeption, with the added problem that is really broken.

What people thinks: was rushed for christmas release, what i think: definetly. Not many changes in vehicles and placeables, in fact, feels it has much less options than it should. 3D Models arent close to the detail shown on promos and arts. You can take models from 5 years ago and will fit just right beside the ""new"" ones. Yea there are horses and there is cotton, but, thats about it with the new. I am guessing the plan for this release was adding a fair ammount of new features, but it has not really been done.

Key upgrades seems  have been completely left out for this release and seems to get added over time, such as terrain modification, maps and vehicles, still, pretty slow at the moment. The ability to modify the terrain is basicly the only thing i can say is woth saying is new and clearly different from previous.

Game mechanics are exactly the same as forever. No upgrades, no new additions there. Graphics wise i dont see much change neither. A lot of low detail alphas, animations and meshes. Nothing outstanding with sounds, probably same as forever as well.

Bugs are all over the place. AI on the helpers is simply garbage and totally worst than older versions. They cannot operate machinery correctly on the easiest fields using the easiest equipment, random errors constantly that stops them from working, and sometimes they wont even understand the task unless you start doing it. They will leave random patches wherever they can. AI on traffic and pedestrians is dissapointing with clear use of simple loops everywhere.

There are also many other random bugs like world lighting issues, multiplayer lag and crashes, missing key information, random things that stops working.. its a mess.

In clonclution, this release is pretty much a dissapointment. Giants needs to realize that its already due to make a large overlaul on the series. The mechanics are simply too old in comparison to up to date games. The quality on visuals and sounds is no longer marginal with current displays and sound equipments. Much more can be done in favor of gameplay, but is being held back by recicling old versions.

* Unlike real farming, there is no real contracts with companies. Like in many cases a company will contract a x amount of a given crop. If you produce more than that, then you don't harvest it since you're wasting money. While in this you will always be able to sale your stuff.
* It should be noted that there is no requirement to eat,sleep, etc. You don't get sick and you can't get hurt. In fact, you can run your truck in the side of a tree with no problems. (this is good and bad in itself since the physics is pretty bad)
* Unlike real farming there is no wildlife other than birds. This means you don't have to deal with a bear trying to eat your livestock. And you don't have to deal with EPA over stupid things (If a deer craps in the middle of your field in RL, and EPA finds out about it. They can pretty much make it where you can't use the crop in the general area of that)
* There is no bees in this. 
* There is no greenhouses

Farming simulator is a lot like Farming itself, honest hard work, a bit boring some times but it is simple and rewarding.
The devolpers are also the same as farmers, they work hard and they may make slow progress, but unlike the rich of EA they do progress and dont fall back or cash in on other peoples merits.

Farming simulator 19 integrates bits and pieces of farming manager which now also makes FS19 a bit of a builder, its all we farming sim players ever wanted (oh yeh and the damage mod! but there is always farming sim 21 to set that right)

Its the step alright.... definatly worth the money, as this is not an expencive game. 

Disapointed:
Nights are still way too light, its annoying seeing paddocks far in the distance at night...and I wish the cone of the headlights would push forward more... so when I mod the nights darker, like im going to need to, the lights would be more realisitic... Also going to have to wait for a placeable light mod too.

They always miss stuff..... So you need pallets of things from the store, they give you a forklift, but no simple flat bead to load it onlike in the early simulators... I hope i missed it, and its there waiting me to find..... but it looks like I will be using the low loader till it turns up..... It just annoys me these guys always miss something :( Lack of buildings ect also makes the game painful.

Where the heck is my 100 things to go find... its not million dollars I miss its finding the little bloody things, and completeing it.... then wish instead of getting a million dollars that they gave me a cool tractor.... Wrong step in wrong direction I am bloody grumpy about this

Happy:
- I started with nothing.... Hell yeah
- I like the new Kuhn stuff, gonna save me some time, and its pretty cheap to start with ;)
- Like land purchasing
- like that the crop killing is not a mod this time

I was hyped for the release of FS19 as it was to improve on the basis of its older versions. I was sincerely let down. It let me down in some major aspects: Layout of the store/controls and menus. Selection of equipment. Not user friendly when picking graphical settings. New features that are confusing to use and not user friendly (Landscaping).

The new interface has been improvement to make farming sim look more higher quality but it is harder to navigate and to understand. This is similar within the shop with more sub catergories but with a minimal amount of machinary in each. Within the combine section there is only 5 combines from my memory which is a severe decreases from fs17. I have a sneaky feeling more will be introduced in DLC at a cost. 

When i first loaded up fs19 i needed to change my graphical settings as it looked poorly pixelated on the main menu. I spent 20 minutes changing settings with little change and with no understandng on most of the options.

New features such as landscaping are very hard to understand, hard to control and can create more problems than solutions.

Workers havent had any improvements from what i can tell.

I would wait until next year to see if the game changes at all but in its current state i find it not fun, unusable and frustrating. I have over 1000+ hours on my pc and ps4 for FS17 alone.

See, the Farming Simulator franchise has meant a lot to me in the past. I met a lot of amazing people indirectly because of this game (through FS-UK) and had many great years playing FS13, 15, and 17. Once again GIANTS has released their latest game, two years later as normal, and once again it contains new features - some of these have been inspired by popular mods for the prequels, and others are new concepts altogether.

But my problem with this game is that, you quickly realize that underneath its new gameplay elements, and new brands and prettier visuals, at it's core it's still the same old game as it's been for over ten years now. Unrealistic, artifical-feeling default maps and clunky arcade-like controls that in no way represent farm equipment operation and bring to question the ""simulator"" portion of the title. Games shouldn't have to rely on mod creators to make their game what it is - mods should add to the game, not be required to get the full effect.

GIANTS should take a page out of SCS Software's book. Since the release of Euro Truck Simulator 2 and American Truck Simulator, they've continuously updated their flagship titles and released the occasional DLC for revenue, instead of an entirely ""new"" game every couple years. This means that mod creators only have to tweak their creations with the new updates instead of completely overhauling them to make them compatible with the new title, and loyal fans don't have to re-buy the same game continuously. It's getting annoying re-purchasing what seems more like a moderately updated version of the same game I bought two years ago.

Personally I've grown tired of the franchise and the game that I used to love only bores me now, but maybe that's just me. If it was a brand new game entirely maybe I could see myself getting some enjoyment out of it, but like I say it feels like the same game it's always been after playing it for just a few moments. So I guess my recommendation would have to be that if you're new to the series, go for it. If you've played other FS games and don't find them fun anymore, don't bother getting this one because it's unlikely to reignite your interest. And remember that in two years time, this same game is going to be re-released, and you'll once again find yourself starting over.",1545584304,1545619241,False,197,5,0.81327509880065918,15,True,False,False,76561198090927945,44,8,38866,1863,744,1602031991,,
19,47760365,english,"As big of a fan as I've become of the Farming Simulator series, I have to say I'm somewhat disappointed with this latest iteration. Giants has made some significant inprovements in the appearance of the game, which I have to say are, at times spectacular (new clouds!).

However, I find it interesting that Giants has, for several installments, ignored the community's most requested features, and added less inspired features that, for me, largely fall flat. It is my opinion that they have become too dependent on the game's extremetly dedicated modders to add what their customers want most.

For years, the likes of GPS, Follow Me, Seasons, CoursePlay, and mouse steering (God, how I miss mouse steering on my laptop) have been left to the modders to supply to the community. If this is the intent, wrong though I believe it to be, then get the tools to the modders prior to release so customers don't have to wait for features that they became reliant upon in the previous release.

The new features that are included are mostly misses for me:
- Horses - Don't really care. They're well-animated, but I'd rather tool around in a pickup. Training is a time sink.
- Dog - A neat touch, but the effort would have been better spend making  GPS or mouse steering a standard feature.
- Purchasing ""lots"" - Now instead a buying a field, you buy a field and a little bit of surrounding area. Not sure what the point was.
- The new difficulty modes - Many problems with this, in my opinion. Everything is overpriced. Placing already expensive structures becomes ridiculous if there's even minor leveleing required. Most of the new lots don't easily allow for setting up a farmhouse/structures, so you're still likely to be in the default starting location. I will say that the recently added (expensive) terraforming tools will help with this. I still think most are going to cheat their funds to get past many of these issues.

I hope that Giants will take more of thier customers' requests to heart (as they did bringing John Deere to the game) for long-awaited standard features. The practice of charging dedicated customers for three quarters of a game and letting modders spend their time finishing it at their expense is exploitative and kind of sleezy.

The core game is still strong and will, of course, only be made better by the modding community. The number of manufacturers and volume of equipment are impressive and model quality is extremely detailed (animated PTO's, etc.).  I still, with some reservations, would recommend the game, but maybe wait six months and get it at a discount.

The main issues were the building placement system being just straight up broken and the economy being disastrously unbalanced.

The update that introduces terrain editing makes placing buildings in an aesthetically pleasing fashion much more doable now, and a mod that allows buildings to be placed anywhere makes positioning items much less of a headache and less cost to construct.

The economy still needs a tweaking in my opinion, as its far too much of a grind to be able to afford high-end equipment. Also that awful dog is just crazy buggy, and I'm not sure I like the idea of making all the animals a placeable-only thing. (Makes for a really ugly farmyard.)

It has been a rough transition as some of the updates have caused configuration files to break (such as inputbinding.xml) but overall can recommend with more confidence now.  Still not perfect--the placeable system is still tempermental and has some bugs, but with the landscaping update it's easy enough to clean up most messes that you might make.

As of 2018-12-09, this game is not finished.  Giants is working hard to patch it, and as it stands, it's playable, and mostly better than FS17, save for a few buggy feature updates such as the new sky/night system, vehicle lights don't work on the South American map, and they're still trying to fix the placeable system.

Don't buy this game untill they fix the AI Helpers.  They are horrendous.  The developers took several steps back in their creation of the AI Helpers.  Just now in my game I had a AI Helper plow a field while I fertilize a field right next to it.  I did one sweep, turned around and started doing another sweep when the AI helper that I had plowing the next field decided to plow the field I was on too, (Creating a field wasn't on, keep to field was).  Almost every time I get the AI to do something very simple they screw it up and I have to go back and finish the job, patches of areas not fertilized, or seeded properly, and this is on simple square or rectangle fields.  There is no rhyme or reason, I've looked.  Even had the 2nd most expensive Harvester with the correct header installed screw up on me, wouldn't move forward, like it was stuck while trying to harvest.

I was even more impressed when I played it myself. I felt so stupid for just simply clicking on the ""ignore"" button on Steam.

But hey....nothing that I can say will do this awesome game any justice. I only have like 110 hours on this game and have only  seen 1% of what the game can offer...but I am VERY happy and impressed by the 1% that I already discovered in the game.

67,46464504,english,"This review is edited from my original posted on 11/22/18.  Today is 12/17/18, and this review is meant to be current.  First, some improvements have been made since my last post.  I will list pros and cons, but first I have to say this:  When released, this game was tatered and torn, and for many (including myself) largely, if not totally unplayable unless you want to steer with a mouse/keyboard.  IMO totally a polar opposite of what I have come to expect fro Giants.  Then, it took them WAY to long to get a patch out, and that patch didn't address many of my concerns.  The Steam forum was full of people very upset with the status quo of the game at tha time.  And when we voiced those concerns (complaints) in the forum, many others shunned us/shamed us labeling us as whiners, or worse.  I realize that the forum - good or bad isn't part of this review, but I want you to get the full picture before investing your money.  As it stands now:
Pros - 1)  This is an improvement over 17 0 lots of new toys!  The ""mission"" system has been completely overhauled and way better.  Many new jobs, the option to use your own equipment to do the job - or lease from the shop for a SMALL price.  Much better!
2)  The maintenance fee for owning equipment that was previously collected at midnight has also been made much better.  Now over time, your equipments needs repair.  There is an option (I took it) to buy a maintenance shop and put it on my land.  Then to repair equipment, you just drive up and press a button and boom!  It's repaired.  If you own this shop the repair is cheaper than at the shop, and you can alter vehicles (for example changint ries from single to wide or whatever) - often for no cost - over and over.  really nice.
3)  There is now a sleep option when it gets dark.  Just set the clock and presto, it's morning again - VERY nice for anyone (like me) who never enjoyed working in the dark.
4) The included maps - there are many varyin gopinions on the maps which are included.  Some like em, some love em, some hate em, and some like one but not the other.  My opinion - I don't particularly like the maps - too hilly for my taste, and the fields are also mostly very hilly.  But this is personal taste - nothing wrong with them.  You also get the Sugar cane map from 17 as a mod.  I didn't like it (the red soil) in 17, and haven't tried it in 19.
5)  New options to start your game in terms of what you start with.  I like the options, but many others have indicated the need for more sub-options.  For example, if you choose to start with a little cash, but 2 fields and equipment, you don't get to choose easy - med - hard modes - they say that this mode is easy - better prices, etc.  Overall, I give the options exisitng now a thumbs up.


CONS 1)  Even today, nearly one month after release, the whole ""controller/wheels"" bugs are not fixed.  They have made some bugs gone, but not all.  THings that are buggy here include wheel settings vor snsitivity conastantly resetting.
2)  The default controller settings interfere with ""my settings"".  For example, I use the Saitek Farm Sim wheel and side panel.  So I map - say just for example ""V"" to my side panel 1 button.  So if it is ""defalut assigned"" by Giants, then there is a conflic and it will not work unitl the conflict is resolved.  Why did they assign it for me in the first place?  It has caused me more problems and time than I care to admit.  I finally just deleted ALL default asignments - and it seemed to work as I have very little problem now.  But figuring this out was a nighmare.  UNFORGIVABLE.  And the worst ""bug"" for me still exists - a month later - and that is the choice to display assigned functions on the screen while I farm is STILL Bugged.  They say they are working on it - but - I've given up on them.  

The game is playable, and much improved over its release state.  But I think Giants released it way too early, and IMO their Quality Control people either don't exist, were not allowed to do their jobs - or were on vacation.  Others say in today's age, no one should expect a totally bug-free release - They MAY be right - but I offer two things to that:  1)  These bugs were way too big, and 2) it seems to me that games like ETS 2, and ATS have no bugs when they release - just saying.  So I have learned one thing from this - I vow to not buy the next FS (likely 21) until it's been out for at least 2 - maybe 3 or 4 months.  Giants let me (and a whole lot of peolpe) down on this one, and I quite frankly cannot forgive them..  I am playing it - because I did pay for it and am thus stuck with it.  But can I recommend it - No I cannot - still bugs, way too long to fix, and really no apology from Gaints.  They do acknowledge there are issues, but no apology - no offer for refunds - etc.",1542923759,1545070371,False,2,0,0,1,True,False,False,76561198031321062,65,10,1908,0,1659,1581369481,,

And if you take a contract read it well because you could sell to the wrong market and bankrupt everything. That was a hard 6 real world hours spent ruining a good start.

69,45907997,english,"Is this a joke? Is this a beta or something?

Spent 3 hours of the game freezing every time I tried to X into or tab into a vehicle. Found a bug thread on the dev's forum. Turns out it was my gamepad. Well, not actually my gamepad. It was my USB hub. Apparently this game can't sort out other devices on a hub, so if you want to use a gamepad (or wheel) it has to be plugged directly into a USB port. So, yeah, I guess all my other peripherals can sit on my desk while I farm. I kid, I kid! I won't be farming, at least not on this sim.

On an i7-7700@2.8ghz (up to 3.8ghz), 16gb DDR4 RAM, GTX 1050 with 4gb, with graphics on high and a few on ultra, this game looks like absolute garbage. Worse than FS17 with ReShade. Draw distances are like a cruel prank. It also runs my card hotter than any other sim I've ever played. Fans maxed out the whole time I was in-game.

No Seasons Mod or Seasons Mod functionality, as was strongly hinted at. Sporadic dynamic hose functionality. Lots of recycled equipment from FS17 (and FS15!). Physics is still, uh...amusing. They did get rid of the Formula One tractor performance, and now they all drive like a 2 door Honda Civic. Which I guess is an improvement. No Gearbox functionality, as was strongly hinted at. No extended AI as was strongly hinted at. You can buy areas of the map, and you can buy structures to fill an entire area and make a farm of sorts. That tends to deform terrain for the transitions around the buildings and it ends up looking like generic structures plopped down via an interface, rather than placed structures. Essentially your 'farm' looks fake and has no immersion.

It's got lime now. Hooray! And horses. Lots of birds fly around. And you get a dog that doesn't do anything.

Seriously, if you want to be this disappointed go stream a Channing Tatum movie. At least it won't cost you 35 bucks and roast your graphics card.

And pre-emptively, no, I'm not a C&C fanboi. I got snookered by those fools and sent them a hundred bucks via Kickstarter for a sim that's never going to be finished. My disappointment with FS is just about FS19 and nothing else.

First I want to say that I have not played a FS game that was this buggy! Giants really dropped the ball on this one! Why they released this game is just mind bobbling. If they used the youtubers as testers, they should really get their free game back. The bugs are from everything from the AI being real stupid to keybindings not saving to game crashes. And Giants fix is a beta patch! I can see many, many patches down the road for this game. In many ways they had a very good ideal with the build your own farm thing, but the way they did it is kinda dumb. They should have left the buy individual fields in the game instead of this stupid buy plots of land crap. What they were drinking I would like to know. They still could have used all the placeables with that option. Graphics are pretty, but only in 4k. In 1080 it looks really not that much different than FS17 (probroly why they told the YT streamers not to compare them). Yes there are some real nice features like the way the plants bend and John Deere in the game. The horse and dog are time wasted! Should have invested that time into releasing a less buggy game.

Final thoughts here are this. Don't buy the game unless you can get it for like $10 dollars! Expect bugs! Is it playable? Yes but you get frustrated with it.

farm building system
small amount of terraforming tools
foliage looks nicer than fs 17
john deere

sounds are horrible
music is worse

Biggest gripes are the bugs that really could and should have been ironed out before release.
Examples are logging issues and trailer lockdown script issues that were all present in 17 and fixed after release.

Der Server ist, gameseitig, nie abgestürzt. Es gab höchstens während der Speicherung einen kurzen Lag.

Vom Feeling ist das Game klasse. Das ingame-Radio ist sehr gut umgesetzt, der Multiplayer-Aspekt ist einfach und simpel. Kein kompliziertes Berechtigen oder, oder... .

Die 3 Schwierigkeitsgrade sind sehr ausgewogen. Da ist sicherlich für jeden was dabei.
Die Mod-Unterstützung ist grandios und sehr einfach. Es lässt sich sehr einfach an den XML-Dat. zusätzlich einige Verbesserungen vornehmen (View-Distance bspw.).

Die Farmarbeit an sich macht ein stimmiges Gefühl. Es ist keine haklige Steuerung. Die Lenkung ist gut umgesetzt, meiner Meinung nach.

Zu Bugs: Ich habe circa eine Handvoll erst mitbekommen. Und davon war keiner sehr spielschädigend.
Ja, manchmal kann man sich leicht verhaken, aber bis jetzt bin ich selbst aus den aberwitzigsten Positionen wieder heraus gekommen. Nicht ein Reset ist nötig gewesen.

Kauft euch das Game und testet es aus. Es ist wirklich grandios und ein guter Landwirtschafts Simulator.

I don't quite understand the bad criticism that has come up recently.
We bought the game together, directly hosted a dedicated server (Nitrado *Enter donation link here*) and that worked perfectly. With some basic knowledge, no problem at all. Performance technically we run on stable 60 fps(1080TI), respectively 50-60(1070).

The server never crashed on the game side. There was at most a short lag during storage.

From the feeling the game is great. The ingame radio is very well implemented, the multiplayer aspect is simple and simple. No complicated authorizing or, or... .

The 3 levels of difficulty are very balanced. There is certainly something for everyone.
The mod support is great and very simple. It is very easy to make some additional improvements to the XML data (e.g. view distance).

The farm work itself makes a harmonious feeling. It is not a hooky control. The steering is well implemented, in my opinion.

To bugs: I got about a handful at first. And none of that was very damaging to the game.
Yes, sometimes it's easy to get caught up, but so far I've come out of even the craziest positions. No reset was necessary.

Buy the game and test it out. It's really great and a good agricultural simulator.

86,47318586,english,"So...
I dove into my new purchase, the highly anticipated next installment of Giant's Farming Simulator series, FS19!

I'm so freakin excited and stoked to play 1000s of hours, yet again, on another release by the King of FS Games 'Giants Software'.  My love of the FS series goes back to FS2011, FS2013, FS15, FS17 and now FS19...well no actually, not FS19..not even 5mins into playing FS19 and I'm floored, disgusted, on the verge of tears for christ's sake.

Why is wheel support relegated to just the basics of steering and gas/brakes?
Why is there a god dam xbox controller setup appearing where I would be costumizing my game with all the neat wheel functions I've used in all previous FS installments?
Why do I even have to point out to Giants that it IS IMPERATIVE that the farming simulator game has to cater to and fully support steering wheels, gas/brake pedals, and control decks when it's released?
What about your own expensive customized Saitek dream wheel setup?  No need for it now? You making an Xbox controller one instead?
I have to stop raging and go for a walk, and it's freakin -25C and snowing here in Ottawa, Canada right now, but I don't care.  It's going to be a long dam winter without FS19 looks like.

This isn't a review, it's a gaming steering wheel support APB report. All players need to be on the lookout for any sign of it's whereabouts and need to inform Giants ASAP.  The first 24hrs are always crucial in any missing investigation.

Ok, so now that I've finally calmed down after my walk in a snowstorm, ended up near the Arctic Circle and then turned around, I can see Giants has sort of fixed the steering issue, but I still need to tweak things on my Logitech GT FFB for it to be the way I want.  I'm not getting any tension in the steering, sort of like FS15 was for me.

As for the game itself, I sort of like it, but I don't really get that feeling of excitement of playing a new rendition of FS.  Cosmetic buildings that do nothing (sold all mine except the house), and placeable animal pens that leave the area look like shit pardon my french.  They've added some terrian sculping and paintbrush function, which I totally suck at.  Not posting my screenshots of my attempt to 'fix' the area around my cow pen,  for fear of being ridiculed.

One big thing that annoys me is my darn dog.  Can't place his dog house too close to buildings leaving it placed out in the open.  Unlike the nice cinematic trailer, he can't actually come along with you in your truck.  That nice ball he gets at the dog house?  He/she can't chase it, just sits there looking at you saying 'I'm not getting that, you threw it, you get it'.

Overall, the game passes for a worthwhile purchase, but it's not what I thought the next FS would be like.",1544063183,1544826568,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,1,True,False,False,76561198045197278,388,57,83719,4342,1107,1602026707,,

Then while you slurping your drink, and spilling that sandwich down the front of yourself. Remember, some farmer, done the repeatitive and grinding tasks that people have complained about. Just so you can complain about having to do what the poor farmer did. While eating that sandwich.

Now, lets get down to the good stuff.

Graphics - Marked improvement over previous versions. Again, not 4K Ultra HD, so don't be expecting the heavens to open up and the angles to sing when you power up you GTX what ever Ti. 

Game Play - Again, better then previous versions. Ok, the dusting you fields with lime every now and then (can be turned off in the in game menu), takes a bit to get use to. But, and I say this is a good way. When you fill your seeders/planter/fertilizers. You'll get the option to unload. When you choose that, make sure you have room. As it will dump it back in bags/pallets on the ground. Even if you fill up from a lime station. I think that is pretty awesome. You don't have to shovel the stuff back in. Crops, grass , bushes will respond to the player, tractor, harvester, tools etc.. when driving over them. No more do they stay stiff and go through the tractor etc... Adds to the fun. Um, yeah there are also nice little quirks in the cabs of the vehicals. The pedals and/or stick will respond to your back and forth commands. Again realy cool little features. And riding the horses around is fun, and required to help keep their value up. If you looking for riding like Red Dead Redemption 2, then you're going to be disapointed. But that being said, it's still cool. And the detail on the horses is fantastic. The building, unless my IQ is in the top 2%, which I am sure my school teachers will disagree with. It's fine, and is better then previous versions. Instead of just be stuck in the on screen postion and only rotating the object you are placing. You can now rotate the screen as well as object (Q E and left and right arrow). You now also have the option to raise and lower the object to help it level with the ground. I am still at a loss as to why some people have had trouble. Chickens, Horses, Cows and pigs. You will need to purchase the actual Pen/Stable etc... And then fill it with animals. Also, you dont buy fields anymore. You by sections of land, which will have a field or two. Or empty space with trees. So for all the people that complained about the animals being stuck on map, Giants now lets you choose where you want to place them. When you purchase them of course.

There is a lot I could go on about. No, I didn't get the game at discount nor for free. I paid full price (AU). And after about 15 minutes was really happy I did. 

If you are sitting on the fence, and really enjoyed the previous versions of the game. Then, grab this, you will not be dispointed. If your looking for high stakes action, with 4K Battle Royal Mode, then keep  scrolling. And don't complain.

Just remember, (1) It's not going to go at 144Hz at 4K Ultra HD with GTX Ti's. I have been playing at 1080p 60Hz with no worries what so ever. (2) Yes, its a farming game. Yes, it's fun if you're into farming. (3) NO! That's right, NO! Battle Royal Mode, it's a farming simulator, you know, where your food starts out from. (4) If you don't like working in real life, then I'm guessing you will not want to work in a simulator. (5) If you have enjoyed the previous versions then this great.

It adds a bit of a better way to get started farming and the prices for equipment seems a bit better than FS17.  But outside of a few new crops and pieces of equipment (mostly for the new crops) there really isnt much here.  The mod community will once again be relied upon for added depth to the game and for adding much needed pieces of equipment and placeables that there really isnt ANY excuse why Giants couldnt have figured out were needed and inserted into the game prior to release.  The game looks a bit better and has a few more pieces of equipment but my honest opinion is wait till its on sale for no more than 20 bucks and hope they have fixed the bugs and the modders have come out with content because it doesnt look like Giants is going to do it.  Oh, and if your relying on contracts to fill in the void and give you good money for real time spent, think again!  Unlike on FS17 when you took an hour of real time to harvest a big field of potatoes or corn and you got 20k+ for it, now your lucky if you get 6-8k for it AND you have to trailer it, and sell it for the field owner!?  So you have to spend almost TWICE the amount of real time to get less than half the money.  Contracting is a complete waste of time!  I like that they added the ability to use your own equipment to get a bit more money, but I have yet to do that, as the price of leasing the (usually better) equipment to get the job done, in no way makes it worth me using my own fuel/maintenace/usually smaller equipment.  So you get to use leased equpiment (that you have to drag from the store to the field...) which is nice to see new stuff, but you get docked money for it and you already get next to nothing for the work.

I grew up in the city and never thought I would be playing a farming simulator in my lifetime. I gave FS15 a go back then and the rest is history. I dare say FS19 is currently my favourite game. 

Farming Simulator 19:
I played FS15, FS17 and hyped and pre-ordered FS19. I can honestly say that if you ever considered a Farm-Sim then this would be the best title to pick up ever up to date. I tried other Farm-Sims Brands/Titles and played previous FS titles and this one is by far the best one out there (Keeping in mind that the Mod Community still needs to produce content this early on after release. Knowing the best is still to come.).

Conclusion:
FS19 has bugs with release and is not perfect but as I type this review, we are expecting a patch early next week with the long-awaited landscaping feature among other things. The multiplayer is ample fun and there is lots of models/content with this release that was buyable DLC's with previous titles.

Final Conclusion:
Best Farming Simulator ever and great value with lots of content and hours of fun if you are into this kind of game. Giants Software does produce I have found. Community Mods is superb quality overall and the community in general is mature and great. I would urge you to buy this if you like farming simulators and highly recommend you try this game if you never tried a farm sim before and is considering a try in this genre.

Bestest Farming Simulator out there, I tried a lot of them and this is my honest opinion.


Edit: I am playing this game on our dedicated server in real time with four friends whom own his own farm on the hard setting. We contract each other for work, as I don't own a combine harvester but my neighbour does and then again I own a fertilizer spreader and is often contracted to work for my friends in the current early to mid-game period.

33,47423493,english,"I got on board the Farming Simulator series at 17, so I'm not really an old hat at this game series (yet). But for me, thus far, it's  an excellent way to relax and just do something that takes no effort to do. That said, I recognize that there are some shortcomings here, none of which affect the gameplay enough to shift me from a ""yes"" to a ""no"" but should be acknowledged:

*FS17 had a map where a player could roll their machines up to dispensers on the farm and have them automatically filled and charged money for the transaction, likely more than it would cost to buy pallets and manually fill the tool. FS19 lacking this option for slightly less involved play, and modders having to add the functionality afterwards, is a slight black mark in my eyes. Obviously most people in this game will want the full experience--get a loader, load the seed/fertilizer/whatever on a pallet fork, dump it into the machine--but if the previous title offers a gameplay option to the player, I feel that the sequel ought not take it away.

*FS17 also had a system by which repeatedly doing jobs for the same farmer visibly accumulated ""friendship points"" for lack of a better term which translated to better pay and a better price for buying land from that farmer. If FS19 retained this, there's no indication of it. I believe an incentive to build a reputation with the NPCs is another instance of a gameplay feature that a prior had that its direct sequel ought not to have removed.

*Until the player become wealthy enough to be managing many fields at once, there is very little to do other than fill contracts for money. When your field is plowed, cultivated, seeded, fertilized, and limed, all there is to do is stare at it, until the next growing stage, and then until its finished growing. A minor complaint to be sure, but there's a fine line between idle relaxation and boring and early game flirts with it.

*This game oozes real-world machinery out of every pore. There are an enormous number of options for what to drive, what to use to seed, cultivate, plow, spray, fertilize, and so on. The sheer content volume and variety is impressive and appreciated. And most of it, there's no reason to touch except for the fun of it. You have a fast tractor with a front-loader attachment that you can get immediately at the start which can be upgraded to have more horsepower for tools than anything short of the most expensive light tractor. The Khun subsoil cultivator/plow is more cost-effective than buying the two tools separately, and is quite cheap. Buying the most inexpensive fertilizer spreader and a weeder beats everything until you're rich. In essence, especially if you're challenging yourself most of the content may as well not even exist. I list this as a downside, but I fully acknowledge that even if there is a solution, it'd be a headache to figure out so this, like the others, is a very minor complaint.

As of 26 hours in, these are the only things I see that could be downsides to this game. Wtih how small they are, it seems fair to say that this is a truly excellent experience that I heartily recommend.

It's not for everyone. Definitely isn't for me. I gave it a chance because of a good gamer friend wanted me to try it.

But despite my best attempts to continue playing it, I just couldn't play it anymore. It was just a painful experience by the end, and I wasn't having any more fun and was actually dreading playing it. Which is definitely not something you want from a game.

Not to say I didn't have some fun. But most of that came because of multiplayer and us messing around with things and just funny querky parts of the game, that are hilarious when you consider this is supposed to be a simulator, but a lot of it is a bit of a joke.

The game looks really nice, has really nice atmosphere. But at the core, it is a grinding experience and just too boring to be a gamers game. After as many hours as I managed to put in, you will likely be like me if you are a gamers gamer, and need some quality gaming sessions that truly stimulate your mind in a way that suits you best.

This game is more of a place to hang out with people and work on your farms while keeping each other company. Or if you just love farming which some people just do.

But if you are not from this genre like me, then my review is more for you. I would not recommend if for you. Unless you know some people that play the game and are happy to have you in their game and will help you out when you need it and vice versa and you can have some fun together messing around.

On a technical level, the game has its faults and you have to give it a pass. But sadly Steam only gives you 2 hours to determine if the game is worth it, and frankly that isn't enough time. This is one of those games I wish I could refund, because I will likely never play again and it's just not a really good game for me. 

Usually I would never get a game like this, because I know I won't be into it. But sometimes it's amazing what impact friends can have on you and what you will try for them. Love you guys.

I won't change the recommended thumbs up, even though deep down I wish they would stick that where the sun don't shine, especially Steam and the devs who refused my refund requests and were completely ruthless about it. Don't get this game unless you definitely know it's something you really want to keep and have. Because 2 hours is not enough time to determine those things. So wait until long after release so you can watch video and get more of an idea on the game. Typically I do that, but with this game, I got caught out. Lesson learned.

---------------------------------------------

End of Review and beginning of my Rant about Steams Refund Policy:

They state 2 hours playtime within a 2 week period.

However I think this needs to change. I rather it was based more on game activity.

For example, how can you tell if you are going to enjoy a game or not in 2 hours in a farming game when in 2 hours you haven't even grown and harvested your first crop yet. I only truely realized this wasn't a game for me, after doing my 3rd Harvest. And I realized it then. Now that is not something that can be accomplished in 2 hours. So it is a ridiculous policy that needs to be flexible with the game it pertains to.

I'm changing this review to a thumbs down just because of that. Had they been more understanding and reasonable, I would have been happy to give them a thumbs up, but stick it up your Acehole, this is the price of refusing me a reasonable refund. Guess that is the final end value of my purchase.

43,45943117,english,"Now lets start of by saying that Giants did many things right, with the new installment of FS19. The expansion in animals and the dynamic land is something that was definetly needed in previous version.
It is a game that is nice to look at and promises almost the same experience as FS17 so if you liked that one and had a few bugs that frustrated you for example in timber and pallet movement, these are solved. A nice overhaul to the field floor texture as well as graphically overall improvements can be seen. 

Now to the wonky bits, the building system......
While the thought of building your farm modullarly is absolutly amazing in practise it is something that will frustrate the player from the get go. In normal mode no farm buildings are given to the player and if you play for example the american map (not very flat), you may soon realise that the buildings will level out the ground.
While this is realistic as no buildings are build angled, Giants did not implement an option to level out ground or even change ground textures with a tool, the essence leads to huge hills that lead up to your buildings.
Also the idea was that you could buy land and create your own farm, well since we can not create roads you have random buildings standing in the middle of a grass patch.

In all honesty I belive that the modding community will help all players but this brings me to the next point. 
With FS19 it seems as if giants got lazy and thought, the things that we dont do perfect the community will adjust, this is a mindset that will destroy a franchise. And this would be a shame!

Pros- grpahics slightly improved, better navigation of map/garage/vehicles (though it could still be improved), doesn't seem to be a limit on the money you can borrow (as in '17), new layers of farming with the lime, like the animations and sounds

Cons- map is poorly designed, joining fields has bugs, there should be a ground leveler (if you plow it, doesn't mean all vehciles can farm it), Cr10.90 and header gets stuck on every field, why can't you harvest in the rain ? Tutorials are very basic and don't really go in much depth, AI still needs to more ""I"", bugs in the fertilizer/lime/weed coverage, not sure how only half a field gets weeds,

A lot of people have complained about not having seasons- ok- but do you farm in winter ? I would just fast forward through the whole season. 

Switching Vehciles is a pain! I'm waiting for the Vehicle Group Switcher for '19 like there was in '17 if there is something out there like this, PLEASE let me know !

I agree with those who say this is more like FS17 2.0, but having said that, how much more do you want- its a farming game, you basically just add more crops, animals to make it a new version.

85,47301739,english,"With 2000+ hours in FS15 and FS17, I feel comfortable leaving a review on FS19 with 23 hours in.  Like all FS games before it, this version is better in all ways than previous versions.  Most things you'd like to see improved or added have been.  Graphics are better across the board.   Not a big change, but better, smoother, and more detailed.  General physics are better, especially ground response and crop response (crops move when driven over).  In cab especially feels more real.  Also now, whether in cab or out, you can see pedals and levers move depending on what your doing.  It's not noticable right away, especially if your not a seasoned FS player, but you'll see it.  It's not a huge thing, but these little details are what make the FS series great.  The new property buying sytem is nice, along with the placaeable aspect, although out of the box, there aren't alot of placeables.  The side jobs now seem more like jobs, and not just free money.  The nice thing especially is you can use your own equipment or lease it just for the job.   You can even put a worker on it if you've got better things to do and have extra equipment to spare.  Also, like all Giants games, very well optimized.

As it is now, 8/10 in general.  If you're a seasoned FS fan, you probably wished for more, and it ends up 7/10 .

What this game is missing at launch, will be completed with mods through the in game mod manager.  A great feature introduced in FS17.   With that being said, it's surprising that a few things are not included in this version without mods:

-Animated map triggers/operable doors and gates.  Especially surprising they took out the operable garage door from Estancia Lapacho. It was in FS17, and gone in FS19???????
-Seasons (I don't want to play that way all the time, but every now and then it's nice. Mods will take care of this)
-Better physics with ground, ie getting stuck/driving through mud.  Both available in early mods in FS17
-Better base maps from launch.  The USA map is garbage.  As an American from the mid-west (AKA farm country) it's 
 disapointing the base US map was so bland, and kind of trashy looking.  Don't get me wrong, alot of the rural farm 
 county looks like that, but most large farm communities don't.  It just felt like it was laid out very poorly as well.  And it's all over the place in general, large fields seperated by cliffs, and ocean, and I'm pretty sure I saw palm trees somewhere.  I guess it's California?  Maybe the Carolina's?  I heard the Pacific Northwest, but unless I was really hammered and imagined those palm trees that can't be right.  It's just weird non the less.  Can't wait for good map mods or the Platinum edition a year from now.  Really, both maps feel almost kind of rushed. 
-More placeables from start.  Yes, there are already mods for buildings.  But with such an emphasis buying land and being able to start your farm from scratch, I expected more available buildings to purchase. Again, mods and official DLC will fill the early void.

All in all, it's better than FS17.  I preordered, and am happy I did.  It's what I expected and more. The few short comings I know will be addressed in mods and official DLC.  Solid game once again.  The next two years of mods and DLC will make this game great.",1543979228,1543979228,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198180330161,164,11,6241,692,1557,1601858063,,
86,47300618,english,"The latest from GIANTS Software, Farming Simulator 19 is here!

I will admit, I was skeptical about purchasing this before I did. But, I'm actually glad I did. 

There's a lot of improvements both subtle, and eye catching. Standing out the most for me is the dynamic clouds that have been introduced for FS19. It was something I longed for in previous FS games and it's been worth the wait. No more sudden hail storms, allowing you to prepare for incoming weather in a way you see fit.
There's also the improved handling, much improved physics, better lighting, better sound, and in my eyes - well...better everything. It's hard to get this much improvement out of the same engine used in previous series' games, and I say good job! The AI traffic is even (somewhat) better (something that really toyed with my emotions in FS17)!

FS19 so far has been a joy to play, and I have no plans of discontinuing my gameplay.

There are sadly some things that I'm hopeful will be remedied, and or tools for us to overcome. Namely - terraforming. Placing down objects on property you own will generally raise the terrain to meet the highest point on which your object is placed on, which can create some very unsightly placements if you're like me and purchase a small field for extra sheds to store your fleet of vehicles and implements. Removing that object leaves a foundation and raised terrain with lips that are at times impossible to climb, and also prohibits you from placing another object down on that foundation as it is itself an object. What I hope to see out of this - terrain tools to raise/lower terrain at a cost to the player of course (think of it as landscaping).

I have also experienced a few CTD's early on with no error messages which can be frustrating, but auto save is key.

The pros outweigh the cons for this title and it was a well worth it purchase. I look forward to the future of Farming Simulator from GIANTS!

Once the official mods kick in this will hopefully add a lot of meat to the game as with FS17.

I can't help feeling that GIANTS should have just released DLC's for FS17 while developing FS in the background. They would probably make just as much revenue in micro transactions and work towards giving us a full upgrade of the series.

My recommendations to the devs are as follows:
1. Create proper ground deformation aka 'Spintires Mudrunner' - folk will be in awe with this kind of realism.
2. Create maps with proper infrastructure, i.e. bigger roads, more intelligible traffic and people perhaps.
3. When creating fields from scratch we all like a nice neat square, rectangle etc. Howabout having the ability to create a sizeable perimeter on the map that allows us to plow the field and if we go outside of this box the plow does not create a field past this point.
4. Organise the garage menu so that it does not take a year to scroll across to your last item.
5. Lets have proper 3D fields and produce rather than the current optical illusion.

Be brave GIANTS, don't just stick with your previous formulation, push the boat out a bit.

I am recommending FS19 on the basis that the mod community will pull this through and the devs will fix the bugs and listen to the users, but if we get to FS20 and there are no significant advances then I will no longer buy any further releases.

I'm sure future FS buyers would have done their homework as to whether this is a good purchase or not.",1543967229,1543967362,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561197975140191,99,4,5036,0,3264,1572743424,,

Auto recognized my Logitech wheel without me having to change settings in other software
AI drivers now keep running while you browse the menus
Driving is a bit more realistic. There is a delay starting out as if you're shifting gears as well as other minor things.

The only downsides are:

There was no improvement in physics from other FS games
There seems to be a minor bug with how weeds show up occasionally and even tho ""Require plowing"" is turned on, the game never seems to let me know my field needs it.

Had to refund, its below pair and below what is exspected for £30, the new idea of placing buildings and what it does to the ground is crap and total garbage for this day an age.  Still only using paint brush field textures as well.

A very very poor desigm idea of removing the

Solar panels
Wind turbines
Lettice green house
Tomatoe green house
Bees
Herb garden
Double train track
Crain track loading

Seems to go beyound the very idea of building your own farm to the point only a numb nuts designer would remove them.  They should have expanded on the ideas not removing them altogether, Then they should have also improved or added more options for the cows/pigs/sheep in making them breed correclty and produce meat, so so so many more options could have been added but instead they added horses, which if i could shoot and kill then sell the meat i would.  Next they be addeding a ground hound race track!!!  There are better my little pony games out there!!!!

FS19 has not been expanded in a way befitting what once was the best farming game so sadly instead being the market leaders they are now just the same as the rest, who in my mind have done better things with less exsperiance.

19,46082953,english,"Like most people have said- If you are new to the farm sim series then by all means pick it up and give it a go. For those of us coming from 17-there's nothing impressive about this game.  Now I don’t hate it. I’ll be playing it all the time. The graphics are great. The ability to buy land and start farming how YOU want to is a great idea and hopefully they expand on it and refine it. They added lime and weeds which are both cool additions to say the least. JD is in the game but then it really has been all the while if you’ve been playing on PC (thanks to all the hard working modders that make farm sim great). So, really not a huge addition. The menu for buying and customizing equipment is cool if you just want to take a look at the machines. Farm Sim is a solid title but they need more.

Now to what bothers me.
Farm sim is great because of mods. How do they go from the library of mods in 17 to nothing or pretty much nothing? I get the game just came out but once again we are at this idea of incomplete games launching and that’s just bothersome. Maybe they expect the community to do all the work while they sit back and collect…….
Helpers are useless in fields that are not square! I don’t think there has been a single improvement since they were first introduced. 
How are things like courseplay and gps not STANDARD in this game.
Where are my seasons? Yeah, sure I get they; be coming down the line but why are they not here now.
Can we get some new terrain physics, please?
So, it hails and my crops are completely fine still?
Once its done raining I can just hop right back in the field and keep at it?
--Expand on these things and give us morrrreee--
Some of these American maps they dream up are silly. Ravenport is a farm that’s inside the Grand Canyon (being a little over the top but I mean it) that’s inside the town. So, you want me to either drive up this cliff to get to all the nice big fields or roll through the middle of town. 
There’s more but I’m starting to get a little annoyed at it all and I am late for dinner so ta ta…

I’d like to say thanks again to all the modders that make this game great and keep it alive.

I thought I'd try out FS19, and was very excited for new delopments in gameplay as well as graphics.

I have been incredibly disappointed.

Specifically for me, I enjoy Logging in the game.
The new setup for using the chainsaw is absolutely terrible, as well as most other mechanics specifically dealing with Wood production.

As for the rest, I know the game is at this time (Dec 18) full of errors/glitches.
One keep running into, is the tractor/harvester randomly freezing up in the field, as if its stuck. Tracks/wheels spinning. Not yet a full load on the unit, and on level ground.

Various issues need to be dealth with - like maybe 6 omnths ago, before release.\

I contemplated getting a refund as I think this is a JOKE uf a game, and I'd rather play FS17 than this ANY day of the week.

I'll wait however to see if it improves, or if its scrapped in favour of making perhaps FS20 - a much better game.

The tracked vehicles have painted on textures, some of the equipment that needs refilling is very difficult to do unless from a pallet even if you have the refill cart. the forklift will not let go of pallets and is frustrating to use. the Sugar cane is difficult to refill from the high dump trailers and was only able to get the one to kind of work. I tried to play the game proper but just ended up cheating money because things do not work like they should or you place an object only for it to deform the land to much you get stuck.

The game crashes alot ive set it to save every 5 minutes because of this and quite frankly im sick of restarting the game 

The harvesters get stuck going up hill so some fields have to be rather threshed from one side then drive back to the other side and start again or width and thats slow and tedious i hate it with a passion (if im doing something wrong here or it can be fixed in game please correct me)

Weeds Weeds Weeds i know you can turn them off but i prefare to play with them on but i cultivate then weed then sow then have to weed again then spray then guess what i have to weed again am i doing something wrong here???

Helper A is blocked by an object that isnt there. Theres just nothing there apart from fresh fileds to farm but this guy doesnt want to move any further pretty annoying especially when your busy doing somethung else then realise your now behind because helper A is blocked by an invisible forcefield.

Handling objects is still frustrating and a little bit of a joke.

I would of liked to have thought you could do more in the farm houses like the dlc in 17 you could go into different rooms ect.

The dog or as i call him party he follows me and gets fed and a pet every now and then it would of been great to see him sat in the tractor with you though,

Dirt doesnt seem to spread on the body of the equipment that well and this is one thing i was hoping was better in this game (set to fast).

Graphics are better nailed it here a really pretty game and nice to look at 

Driving is better alot better i actually dont mind driving to the other side of the map now to get rid of 59000 wood chippings  for £1 anymore 

The shop lay out is better 

the small tiny details on the tractors and other stuff are simply amazing and this is the type of stuff that makes a game for me thats why this got a thumbs up and not down.

42,47241071,english,"Having played since FS11, it is really interesting to see all the changes in the game over the years.

In my opinion some of the new features in FS19 makes it a very good new generation of the game:

- The machinery detail and additional suspension and ground response makes the driving feel much more realistic 
- The way animal pens are placeable and can be put down in multiples, really opens up the game for focussing and scaling livestock farms in a whole new way. 
- The wear and repair system for machinery was previously only available through mods - and seeing this in the base game is great
- Obviously there's been a huge graphics uplift as well
- Finances are more challenging now - things are expensive - but you can blaance it, and there's better access to loans
- Introduction of weeds and herbicides is really great. Sprayers were previously only for fertilising, which frankly was not very realistic. 
- New animals opens up the game to a wider style of players - focus on building a successful horse livery where the farming is done to feed and keep the horses - the options are there now!
- Houses that allow players to skip the nights, or some of the darkest hours at least.
- A massive range of vehicles compared to any previous version of the game!
- Additional crop types that adds lots of new options and tools (sugarcane if you didn't play FS17 with DLC expansion, Cotton, and oats)


Having said that - there are of course also things that seems a little unbalanced. There seems to be many people suggesting a huge amount of bugs, but after 38 hours, I am still to come across one. I knw this can depend on systems, and know there has been issuses with steering wheels, but overall, this game runs very, very well on the same system that ran the previous version of the game - you do not need a absolutel beast of a computer to play this.

The things that mainly are drawbacks - which i suspect might get fixed/balanced in patches are:

- Lighting cuts off quite hard at night/in the morning.
- The prices of some of the animal placeables are quite steep - but what really wrecks this part is the terraforming costs, which easily pushes the costs up by several multiples of the base cost. If you don't pay attention while placing a building, it could empty your bank account!

And as with previous versions of Farming simulator - mods will take this game to even better and exciting experiences in time - across all platforms now. 

All in all - a very warm recommendation for anyone who wants to play a versatile farming game with a tons of features!",1543696232,1543696232,True,2,0,0.515236496925354004,0,True,False,False,76561197962397528,50,5,56097,1555,2821.0,1601920286,,

------
TL:DR: if you dont have FS17, this includes most of the DLC content of that so consider going for this
If you like modding your game, get FS17, the FS19 modding scene is yet to develop

If you are an FS17 player looking to upgrade, dont, not now, and not for full price, even in the future. unless you have a cotton fetish.. i guess.. 
------

Right now, this game offers no significant advantage over FS 17, what new features there are are overally just badly implemented, there are some nice things that are basicly Mods for FS17 that have been turned into content 

this feels Less like a new game but more like a heavily modded FS17 that has its graphics settings played around with and i am very sad to say this because i really enjoyed my experience with the game so far, but i'm going to go back to FS17 for now because this does not offer any significant advantage yet

If you are new to the series and wonder if you want to buy this game or FS17 you should consider this because it also includes most of the relevant DLC content of the previous game, but if you are an FS17 player who wants to upgrade, dont to it yet, and if it doesnt improve SIGNIFICANTLY dont give them full price, ever. FS17 is just... equal to this game... and it saddens me to say that

This is just a reskinned FS17 with a mod package. and thats not what Giants should do, they should improve the things we can't get out of mods, and thats what we pay them for. I dont mind them implementing good mods as standard to their next games, but if its the only thing they do, this is a ripoff, i can't call it anything else.

this is more indepth and while not harder, it does require more thought and planning than previous iterations of the franchise.  Overall I like it, but cant give it 5 stars.  A five star game has doors you can open.  this is at best a 2 to 3 star game.  The maps suck.  Really.  We have these modes where we start with nothing, but really, the only decent place to build aanything is the now empty starting plot from the easy mode.  the plots of land should allow enough room around them to do your building without impacting the field itself, or there should be small plots adjacent to the fields that you can buy that are flat enough to have some fun building your ""dream"" farm that you cant interact with.

overall very meh....  its ok.  Not really recommended.  It's not any better than the previous versions when it comes to interaction with the environment, and in a farming game, that was something i was hoping would be in this edition.

The ""Farm Manager"" mode is something that I have been waiting for for years; it's awesome. I was at the point in FS17 where I would just sell off all the stock vehicles and start my farm for my choice as much as possible. The fact that the construction was very limited always bugged me.

The new maps are awesome too. They look so much better than the previous ones. 

The only thing that still really bugs me (as a person who is all about the little things) with the features aspect of this game is that there is no American-styled equipment in this game. Why go through all the effort to try and make an American styled map without American equipment??

Speaking of bugs, the only issue that I have come across so far is a little graphical glitch with the John Deere 6M where if you turn left, the JD logo on the front left fender veers off the fender.

Oh, and spreaking of graphics, the graphics in this game are awesome. A larger jump in improvement compared to the jump from FS15 to FS17.

If there would be anything to me that would make this game better to me it would be to lengthen out the 2 year deadline for another game to 2 and a half, or four years. That would get rid of the rush and people would be more happy with a less buggy game (according to others).

This is Farming Simulator, not Dog Simulator.

Has this been a bit of a rough release? Yes. Is it a bad game? Absolutely not, it's a fantastic game, by far the best farming simulator release so far, and considering I've already put in 100 hours over 10 days on a $35 game puts this in the ""best value"" category for me.

People talk about the lack of vehicles / tools / implements, most of those are being added as official ""mods"" by Giants which can be downloaded ingame or through their website. This was likely to cut down on the initial file size.

Player created mods are coming, it takes time. A lot of people were complaining that there were no mods practically the day of release. These people are dumb, don't listen to them.

FS 17 was buggy as hell at launch too, but these folks had it all sorted out in a few months. I'm pretty bummed at the moment, but can confidently recommend this version knowing that it will all be okay soon.

75,47201092,english,"With only 9 hours of gameplay so far, I can say I had enough. I've played FS15 and FS17 and both of them are resonably better than this. The ""overhauled graphics"" and ""Brand new graphics engine"" really isn't what GIANT has lived it up to be, as the game only looks good if you max the settings with only 15-24fps. The background scenery is a sloppy mess which they didn't put any effort into and the trees look like they have knives for leaves. Moving on, the building in the game is an utter disappointment and rarely ever works in your favour. The buldings deform the land in hideous ways and give you a headache as you can barely place anything in them if they are on uneven terrain. It costs a fortune to place a bulding anywhere but flat land and ruins the area around it. Furthermore, there are so few buildings, that i dont even know why we have the option to bulid! You have an over priced farm house that does absolutely nothing, a couple ugly silos, a few sheds, and little to no useful buildings on top of the few i mentioned. And the dog! Don't even let me start! It's a clumsy, poorly put together animation and model which is a pointless mess. 

Now for the farming. The overall farming feels like any other farming simulator. It's choppy animations and ugly pop-in textures are all the same. The steering of the tractors is very slow but somewhat okay, and if you go anywhere over 40-50km/h, you end up doing a double backflip into a wall or fence somewhere. The first person view is slow and eats your frame rate, and the animations for operating the vehicles that GIANT praised is just simple. Nothing special about it. Now lets talk about the prices. The land that you purchase is way too over priced and makes the game a chore. You can barely make a living no matter what difficulty and the land that you think would work to put a shed on, is occupied by empty space that wont let you place any objects. Also, they got rid of the vehicle menu so that you cant find your vehicles or reset them. The only way to do it is to zoom in really far on the map and click on the icon. This way you cant find vehicles or equipment and check to see what you have if you're on a big farm. It is honestly disappointing

The game has major bugs and issues. If you tab out of the game at any point or even go to your toolbar, the game chooses a random aspect ration and basically streatches or shrinks your game to oblivion. Another great one is a sound bug that ear rapes you with one loud ass engine rev. There are so many that the list would go on forever. Honestly, its a piss-poor effort of a game and they should be ashamed to even call it a simulator. There are better FREE games out there than this $50 title. It feels as if they didnt even test it.

To wrap the whole thing up, its a huge disappointment. GIANT is just one big scam and puts no effort into making games at all. Oh and I forgot! It rains indoors still. They completely lied to us.

This pains me to say, but after loving FS17 to death, FS19 appears to be early access gone wrong (and it's not even early access)

Pros:
-Graphics Engine is vastly improved
-Tractor sounds are far better

Cons:
-Bugs Bugs Bugs Bugs
       -The first few bugs I encountered weren't game breaking, but the more I played, the worse it got.  I had to reset the career twice.
-Mission System is improved, but some tweaking needs to be done. (Missions not showing complete when you finish, not letting you work on a field that you have a contract to work on, etc.)
-Missing essential equipment like flatbed trailers and other implements to do work around the farm

I was afraid Giants bit off more than they could chew, and I believe I was right.  Maybe with some updates and mods, the game will get better.  If that happens, I will update this review.  Nov. 20, 2018

90,47191759,english,"Let me start by saying I really want to like this game. 
Additionally - I think this is like the 2nd review ive ever taken the time to write.
I have a few hundred hours on fs17, and was expecting at least that level of polishment.

The Con's List ( so far )
- So few buildings the "" farm manager "" option is a joke
- Vehicle model glitching after going like 40mph
-""Dead spots"" in multiple fields where crops will not grow
-""Helpers"" are still almost un-useable
- American map has more narrow streets than the euro map
- Everything is so expencive that you get to either have vehicles or buildings to start, not both
- The Dog .. lmao ... 
- Farm plots naturally divided by default on the map , arent actually divided, Helper plants both reguardless of grass barrier
- Additional little 4x4 offroad cart ( the preorder thing) is only available 50% of the time i look at the store.
- Missions arent worth doing for the crap payout
- When you start a mission, and lease the equipment for the mission - you must also drive all things individually to the mission farm plot , from the store ( which by ur self trying to drive a combine and a tractor from 1 side of the map to the other, wasted 45 min - just setting up to do a mission that took 2.5 ACTUAL REAL LIFE hours, for a payout of 18,968.

- Takes twice as long to ""load"" all menu options vs fs17


Pro's List ( its a short list )

- Graphical improvement .. 
- The plants actually bend and fall over when behind driven on
- The sky moves now, it isnt just a static picture
- Attention to detail of vehicles - fantastic!
- The moveing parts are nice, unfoldable things on tools, seats and wheel and character model in vehicles
- Can do missions on multiplayer................( not worth tho )


In summary ... like others here have said ... leave this disapointment alone until they fix everything ..",1543512844,1543513698,False,6,1,0.562340974807739258,0,True,False,False,76561197986970027,108,2,9520,0,3011.0,1581049496,,

92,45917048,english,"Hm... it`s like when you buy a chocolate with a fancy packaging and after taking a bite it dawns upon you that the looks are deceiving. So prior to buying the game i have played the FS17 for weeks...so after starting the game i could see the differences immediately.
Is it a re skin or it`s a new game? 
Well on the tech side i don`t know but on gaming side...well 90% of the game feels like FS17 tho the foliage graphics are beautiful, there is more grass everywhere and the new foliage bending when you drive on it looks amassing compared to the FS17 foliage. But sadly thats it. Everything else is more polished sharper but FS17 had some mods that replaced the ground textures with 4K ones and this feels like that. No more than a texture polish.

!Update! - this game suffers from the same limited Sphere LOD draw distances as the FS17 in which on max settings i saw as the foliage and crops pop in after a distance. This LOD draw distance seems to be sphere shaped emanating from your position. The sad thing is with the new game and new graphics i would expected this to get solved. But no :(.

!Update! - AI - now that i have spent a considerable time in the game and used 70% of the time the ""Helper"" i can confirm that die ""Helper"" AI got an overhaul. How much of an overhaul? Well i think a complete re-wright. In FS17 if there was a tree, lamppost or anything at the edge of the field the AI just rammed it and got stuck. Now i can plow my field to the edge of the road, forest because the AI will detect what is in front of him, go as near as possible, back up and turn on the field. I have a filed that is on one end 1m from the road with lampposts, and on the other end 5m from a forest. In the last 12 hours the AI managed to plow, cultivate,plant and fertilize the field without getting stuck or any intervention from my part. In FS 17 that was not possible. Traffic AI has been improved, they try to leave room for the tractors to turn on the road, but sometimes they tend to wait on tractors that are 30 m from the road and will never get on it, and some times they don't detect the tractors at all and ram them. So there are some things to polish but as far as the Helper AI goes...it`s definitely an improvement.

Is there an improved physics in this game compared to the previous games?
Well i have just the FS17 to compare it to and sadly the physics are the same. But i must mention that the off road vehicle that you can get in a DLC has an amassing suspension movement...most realistic that i seen in FS. But it can go up a 45-50% steep cliff whit eas...so much for physics. Tires bend under pressure...same as in FS17, indicators can be hit and they will fall...same as FS17...you can place buildings...same as FS17...but it was improved upon and now you can make your own farm instead of  getting one prebuilt farm...which you steel can if you choose so.

How hard is it on the PC? Performance
Sorry to see that it`s poorly optimized. Graphics on Very High gives me a whooping 60 FPS (thats the max for my monitor) but as i start to move and whit fields and foliage in my close vicinity it dips to 30 FPS but not lower. So you could think yeah try upgrading your graphics card men...well i have a 1080 with 8GB RAM so....that`s that. By the way the card is 100% utilized and the game uses 2-3Gb of Card memory. Well it could be a CPU related problem...do you have a i5 3600? Nope i7 7600 4 cores 8 threads... and it barely scrapes the 30% utilization during my play time. So it must be a HDD problem buy an SSD. Well i done one better i have an M.2 SSD :) so it`s 3x faster then a SATA SSD but with no benefit`s in this case as the game runs from my 16GB memory and the SSD barely reaches 1% utilization during game play. So....poorly optimized. And yeah i have the latest drivers... and i even used NVIDIA`s optimized settings for this game. So how can you solve this FPS dipping? Well i found 2 options which work just fine and i have constant 60FPS. One is looking in 3rd person view at the ground like GTA London style :). Or lowering foliage draw distance to 100% and all other LOD and Draw distance to 100 - 150% out of 200% at a 1080p resolution. ON A FUCKING 1080. 

The game looks gorgeous don't get me wrong an there are improvements like when buying a field you get an amount of surrounding terrain to not just the field it self, the 3D preview where you can see what are you buying (just to mention the camera moves with your mouse even if you ain't holding left mouse button down, it`s annoying to say the least), cabin and chair movement and now our surrogate turns the wheel with his hands and pushes the pedals with it`s feet which is awesome for immersion (i would mention that in combines and for Helpers this animation is laking). Hit boxes where updated and now you actually can go ower railway lines like in the real world without your vehicle hovering on an invisible box. Birds fly out of the foliage time to time which helps with immersion. Maintenance is added...don`t know how it works really but an indicator with a wrench is there. Interior screens and gauges work...but as i saw it it`s limited and more or less same as in good quality tractor mods. Horse play is included and a dog but i head no time to test that because of the performance issues. The sky is beautifull with the new moving clouds. And now for keyboard users there is an option to modofy how fast doas the wheel get to strait after turning...but the cars and tractors all turn sharp and unrealistic. I would say the driving with keyboard is whorst then in FS17...and i booted the FS17 just to see if it`s so...and yeah. Over all all tractors...implements...trailers are with improved graphics...expected from a 2018 release.
Update! I played a little bit with my settings and with Vertical Sinc on i have these problems that i mentioned with FPS dipping to 30 and with Vertical Sinc off it improves so much that i can set everithing to max and the minimum that i haw 30% of the time is 38FPS. 

But on the bad side the Isle map is full with design problems...just to mention one...every single railway crossing. The rail tracks stick out like a sour thumb and you just clip true the rails...it`s disappointing to see this...and if i go to FS17 there are proper railway crossings. Unloading seeds looks horrible with a seed shower not even getting to the ground...the seeds disappear in thin air 95%  of the way and by the first trailer that you can buy the seed when unloading at the default position you see the door opening and you would expect the seeds rushing out from the full trailer...but no there is an invisible wall holding the seeds and letting only a thin line to flow out. It`s eve worse then in FS17.
!Update! - now with more time in the game a had the chance to try more trailers out...i`m sorry to say that all unloading animations...like Kombines or trailers have either timing issues or they just go through the trailer (Auger Wagons for instance).

So buy or not to buy. Well now that i played this game i can`t go back to FS17 :). That shoud answer it.

How the hell did this go through beta?

And NO: I unplugged EVERY USB-Device and THEN I plugged in a mini-laptop-mouse to test, whether it comes from any of my devices. No, it doesn't.

Combining the pedals, as many mentioned, does not help either. And not having to combine those pedals worked in FS17, so why would it not in FS19?

The Mahindra Addon for Pre-Orderers is ... ugly. I did not go further as buying and driving this ... thing ... any further, due to my controller-issues, but ... no ...

Here and there I read about a ""Day-One-Patch"", still missing it, though.

And yes, not being able to play this game via Wheel/Pedals is a game-breaker to me.

====================

Edit: 2018-11-22:
Well, the issue with the ghost input was due to some xInput Device, which I turned off in the device manager. Okay, my bad. Still not playable, though.

The next issue is, that the game does not save my keybindings. I use a Thrustmaster T500RS which is labeled ""B65E"" for whatever reason in the game.

The ""funny"" thing, though, is that if I change deadzone/sensivity settings for my TM, I see the following:

Axis 0: Deadzone: 0.14 ; Sensivity: 1.00
Axis 11: Deadzone: 0.14 ; Sensivity: 1.00
Axis 12: Deadzone: 0.14 ; Sensivity: 1.00
Axis 13: Deadzone: 0.14 ; Sensivity: 1.00

It does absolutely not matter what changes I do, after saving the changes and restarting the game, the values I mentioned above are set again.

Well, there is an inputBinding.xml file in Documents/my Games/FarmingSimulator19 which contains those values. Well, sort of, only axis 0 is listed here.

If I add axis 11 to 13 and do whatever with the values, e.g. setting the deadzone to 0, the game only notices it for axis 12 and 13. After just closing the game, the lines for axis 11 to 13 are removed from the xml file.


Still a gamebreaker, BECAUSE I HAVE TO PLAY WITH DEFAULT BINDINGS ... Got about 90 minutes of play time. If the bug-tracker forum (buahahahah xD bullshit -_-) does not reply within the next two days, I'll order a refund.

This sucks as well, because this report will vanish from steam -_-

Edit 2: The support answered within minutes, after mentioning plans to refund the game ... interesting. Anyway, there is a fix in development and will be released ""soon"".

Furthermore there are Bugs and not enough tutorials or explainations of what works with what. So there is way too much trial and error involved.
Helper AI is just retarded and there is nothing new about that. No drving circle wise or the ability to get a field done thats not a perfect rectangle. For many straw reölated machines there isnt even a helper option which makes the game even more grindy and shitty. Who in their right mind wants to pick up hundreds of straw balls per hand? or get over those lines with a loader? 

I havent played multiplayer but i can see that there is not enough room for many people own farms on those maps so thats a fail too. Even worse since placeables are so bad.

The missions are underpaid and retarded and there is no plus to them now.

I dont want a dog and i dont want a horse. I dont need a radio.

I need a good traffic system maybe even with some cops and damages.
I need some Good usable buildings to buy and live in.
 
Maybe also a Wifey like the Farmers Dynasty game has.
Some options of repairing stuff would be useful too. Even repairing tractors and machines like in those car repair sims because in real farming you do shit like that all the fucking time.

Real Ai competition and real businesses and making contracts yourself.

Well I was also excited for 19, however after playing I feel it is a let down, best part of the game is the intro screen, they must have spent all their development money on it. In game graphics are improved over 17 but not as great as one would expect after all the hype. Vehicles are beautifull but the map is still not that great, nor are the animals. And the physics... WTF, did they even try and cross the railway tracks with anything pre release? Vehicles constantly get stuck on them in extremely unrealistic ways, and when not being stuck on the train tracks you'll get stuck on nothing in the middle of your field. Hired Workers are no better than previous versions driving off cliffs, getting stuck in the middle of the field for no reason. Dual wheels still seem to have no purpose I know we didnt expect terrain deformation but seriously could we at least get some physics with traction? and no more tipping anyware? Why would you remove this feature. Once again giants has released a poor product hoping the mods community will fix it. We got the retriever for pre order, but with johndeer liscencing why is their no gator in the base game? I missed the pre order and now have zero access to a side by side untill mods fill the void. And the build your farm ...Let's face it the technology is their for us to have been able to dig and level our own land with the front loader, instead it costs you 500k to build the smallest chicken coop because the terrain must be leveled this also leads up to some serious hill climbs onto your silo. Super buggy I wouldn't buy again if it wasn't on sale, and I have bought every farm sim day one.

Tldr. Good vehicle graphics, poor graphics otherwise. horrible physics, crap farm building, once again left for mod comunity to finish the game lots of bugs.",1543423136,1543423136,False,6,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False,76561198101449431,66,1,49557,0,3329,1595445268,,

Wheel steering is garbage as every year, no force feedback. No driving modes - you have to drive reverse by pressing the break!? Really Giants? Are you devs riding with horses to your work? Have you ever driven a vehicle with at least a throttle a break pedal??
Why do headlights don't generate shadows, but the beacon though? Why? Aren't you good at copying and pasting, are you?? 
What are these concrete made cars? Why are they still in there in 2018? I'd rather go back to 2013. Is this a template for a good joke when we get stuck between 1.5t cars with our 500HP tractor?

14,47162901,english,"After playing for just a couple hours I already couldn't even imagine going back to FS17. 80 hours later, farming still feels better than it ever did before. Good job Giants :D

Almost every single aspect of the game has been improved from FS17 in some way. Most notably:

- item handling: Moving things by hand is no longer frustrating! Things no longer fly out of your hand whenever you touch anything, no Herculean strength to flip tractors with a piece of wood and able to rotate items in-hand. Looking forward to conventional balers at this point.

- vehicle handling: greatly improved, steering feels much more realistic (using keyboard), you can feel you're driving a several ton piece of machinery, suspension and ground response better than ever

- vehicle maintenance: vehicles no longer have daily maintenance fee, instead they have wear and tear that you have to fix for a small fee (similar to what Seasons mod did in FS17), resulting in massive decrease in passive running cost for the farm (idle vehicles don't cost you)

- land management: you no longer own entire map except the fields, land/field expansion feels more natural with having to buy the land. Buy a forest, cut down the trees and turn it into farmland!

- buildings: finally able to build up your own farm other than just adding a couple sheds, although placing stuff on anything but a very flat ground can cause issues. Upcoming terraforming feature will fix that, potentially. Also choice of buildings in base game is limited, but I'm sure modding community fill flood the game with dozens of new items soon.

- field management: new lime and weeds mechanics, greatly expanding on the ""fertilize 3 times"" approach from FS17, more stuff to do between sowing and harvesting phases

- new stuff: cotton, horses, sugarcane (for those without FS17 platinum). All with their own mechanics/machinery. More variety of stuff to do, even if cotton is pretty bad profit compared to other crops.

- contracts: complete overhaul of missions, much less clunky although somewhat buggy at the moment (weeds will overtake NPC fields permanently)

- animals: chickens are finally not useless, as eggs will spawn in boxes without having to collect them manually. Placeable animal pens require higher initial investment in livestock, similar to buying fields for arable farms. 

- shop: better separation of vehicles and implements into categories, full 3D preview of machinery and its configuration (""Does this tractor look silly with narrow tires and painted pink? Did that trailer have a hitch on the back or not? I'll just look and see!"")

- graphics: not a massive leap forward but pretty good upgrade overall, game feels to be running smoother than FS17 too. Big improvements in lighting and atmospheric visuals, you can easily see the difference in the overall image and feel of the game. Beautiful sunsets and night lights :)

- audio: a lot of good enviromental sounds, engine sounds stand out much more than in FS17

- interface: new interface look, much cleaner, more readable and compact


Stuff that did not improve (or marginally):
- AI Workers: Almost as derpy as always :D, seem to miss less parts of a field on angled edges though
- Logging: while the new chainsaw animation is good, it seems 'aiming' the cuts is less intuitive, pieces of wood can still get glitched after cutting (weird collision box and mass) and still missing any sound when a massive tree falls down. Need that satisfying 'creeeeeak-THUD'

While the game sure has some issues currently, none are too serious or game-breaking (as far as I've encoutered).",1543400628,1543400628,True,129,7,0.903180181980133057,2,True,False,False,76561198052426481,73,2,51523,356,6595,1601861383,,

Sadly this is true. 

But.

We've atleast got weeds to care for now. And the material shading is nice aswell as the volumetric clouds or w/e it's called.
Other than that it's basically the same as before. We even got the FS09 map back, guess it's an anniversary kind of deal.

Another but.

MP is better than ever. Lets hope Giants don't fall behind on this which leads me to think about...
(engine)sounds are in my opinion not as good as they were in FS17.

Hopefully we've got a much needed competitor running up soon so FS series will come under some serious development.
I mean, instead of spending 'all that money' on exhibition presentations and flashy booths.

But for now, that competitor isn't in place yet so if you're looking to operate cool big machines without any thought I can recommend this. But if you're looking for that S in simulator, save your money.

Ok after switching to felsbrun, map, and putting more hours into it, totally vanilla.  I have to say the game seems a lot better.

Havnent noticed any more bugs that are too annoying.  Seems a patch may have fixed the workers.

If anything the worker seems better when judging difficult obsticles.

Loading with the fork lift is much better, the forks dont seem to get stuck so much or at all. :)

A big bug seems to do with fields not owned by me, they all seem to be withering, not as many contracts.

Yeah so im much happier with it now.  Just need some time, i cant stop playing now lol.

Im making money from mowing the berms around the fields.  be careful not to drive big wheels over them.

So its worth it. 7/10


THIS IS MY ORIGINAL REVIEW BELOW



I first got into FS, when i bought fs17.  Over 1000 hours.  Played vanilla for a few weeks before switching to some mods.
Mods such as seasons and courseplay.   I like a challenging game.  

Well i swore off every pre ording a game since no mans sky.  However i could not resist the appeal of fs19.  I just wanted to set up my own farm, the way i like it.  

I guess my expectations were to high.

I would say that this game is like an early release.  Some improvements.  Some things backwards.  the combine harvester looks like low res version of fs17.

I feel like the devs did not put much effort into this.  Im glad the price was only 50 new zealand dollars.  would have been pissed off if it were higher..

Already in the first hour found some bugs.  My hired worker was fking up a simple plough job.  placing a shed was miserable, unless you wanted to pay 10x the value of the shed.  there was only 2 places i could find to place it.

Will have another go, i deleted my first game as the hired worker seemed to fk it up too much and i probably should only do contracts to build up some cash.  But there is only so much time i can put into grinding.

Ill give it 3/10, tho i expect some improvments and i havent played for very long.  so i will revisit this review.

Hopefully some mods will fix it.",1542700679,1543268419,True,0,0,0.50972449779510498,0,True,False,False,76561197971077433,175,19,101670,3593,4369,1602050050,,

And you can't run it over, which is good because tractors are kinda hard to control when badly laden. (Sorry, dog.)

Unlike previous games, you start with a blank slate, at least in normal mode. You have a bit over a million, no land, no vehicles, no home. Buy what you want, where you want, then go farm it. But you have to buy your own silos and animal pens, and even access to the biogas plant's bunker silos and their land to dump silage on.

I like how grass, weeds and bushes are animated and how they look. Don't really like that the interaction between them, seems a bit weird and unnatural.

Found really annoying the fact that shadows do a litle dance, like the light source moves left to right all the time.

=============================
Alright，played hours last night. To be honest, I prefer back to 17. I am afraid it's a waste of money. This is a semi finished product, alpha or beta version!
At begining I said 19 will be a MOD of 17 eventually. Then I felt I was wrong after watched several videos. However the fact is it even can't be good MOD for 17!
First is Chinese translate, I prefer English. 
Then, anyone tell me where is hooklift?
Dolly, still single axle. Do they know how many people downloaded the double axle dolly MOD? For Europe semi-trailers, single axle dolly is okay, since most of their tractor units are single rear axle. But American semi-trailer still single axle? They have provide tripo rear axle American tractor unit to fit semi-trailers, still use single axle dolly?
Trains, really disappointed, even a disaster! Far worse than 17! Am I dreaming? Train can't switch track but full of siding tracks along main line? Body moddling? The BR143 looks not bad, but WTF is the SD41-2? Are you kidding me? Is it a tough job to find a picture of EMD SD40-2 locomotive?Couplers are nither American nor Eurpen. And train is a whole thing in game, but look at what happen when press [Q]?  Semi-disabled coupler? 
Log trucking, no matter semi-trailer or truck, only Europen available?  If I want to transport log via road, if I don't want to use tractor, the only way is ""inport"" from Europe?

Just drived New Holland CR10.9 harvester, it press header on the ground too hard caused driving track lost grip, can't move when uphill, I had to interrupt helper's job, turn around to summit, then downhill.

Many of the new features are buggy, poorly thought out or very shallow.

The core of this game remains almost identical to the previous release, yet somehow they managed to introduce enough bugs or bad design decisions to make this game extremely frustrating to try to play. Read through the Giants forum to get an idea before you buy.
Issues include:
[list]
[*]Terrible support for controllers (doesn't support more than 4 input devices, resets controls constantly or totally disables them - the game removed the hire worker control for me so I was unable to hire a worker at all)
[*]Poorly balanced or broken mission system, cannot complete some missions
[*]Multiplayer control axes reversed from single player
[*]They have added a delay with throttle inputs, making any work with a forklift or telehandler difficult
[*]The placables system is basically unchanged from FS17 but is now compulsory for working with animals. This would be fine except that there are virtually no places on the maps where you can place the buildings without creating a ridiculous ugly ramp up to the edge of the building because there is no flat ground. And don't bother trying to delete existing buildings because nothing can be built in the space that they once occupied
[/list]

Graphics look nice up close, but most of the models in the game are the same as FS17 with slightly improved textures. Improved foliage effects only served to make the LOD pop-in more ugly by comparison. Lighting is definitely an improvement, the menus are better and I like the new lime/fertilisation system.

Same models as FS17.
Same textures as FS17.

I really enjoy the new seat and pedal animations that they now include which really helps it be immersive, and the multiplayer contracts have really made the game more enjoyable for online players.  It would be nice to see their new flagship crop to actually be of use instead of being the least proftiable crop in the entire game.  It seems like prices and the main cash crop haven't changed from the last version, which isnt nessicarliy a bad thing, but it would be nice to be able to play with the new crop type and not lose money in the new ""hard"" mode.  I really enjoy that they now offer three different modes, one like the traditional fs17 games, one where you start out with plenty of money, but no equipment or land and must purchase it yourself, and one that you start out with very limited money and no equipment or land.  It has given me something to work for without reaching endgame in just a few days.

Vehicle textures have improved along with field textures and richness of color.

There's several new features that add some welcomed depth to the series. I enjoy the option of being able to set up wherever I want as well as addtional field maintenance to acheive maximum efficiency.

( HINT : Yes, there are a handful obvious spots on the map where they are basically inviting you to build, BUT you can revert any plowed land back to grass and virtually homestead on any section of map, given it's owned land) 

The US map is a bit stark and a bit odd for a ""farm feel"", I think they were going for a Northern California farming community feel with the map.....it is growing on me, albeit slowly. I trust there wont be any shortage of available maps once people have time to complete map mods.

It seems like people were hoping for more, that's understandable. Given Giant's trackrecord, the new releases have always been a bit ""updatey"" but, as far as I'm concerned....I'm happy with the game.

Seasons anyway???...... What am I going to do? Chop all the wood on my map while my animals starve with the game clock is set to 120x because I can't plant anything?  eh, just my two cents. ( wait, maybe that would be cool lol )

(haven't played with cotton yet)
I don't recommend the game untill the Devs can catch up with what the modders always fix

First off, the good stuff. Graphics are beautiful, crisp and detailed. The crops, plants, trees loof like real living things in the enviorment. The new levels of soil care and tools for soil care add new depth to the game. The pre built maps are detailed and fun to explore, also enjoyed that we got the south american styled map as well for free. The new land buying system is great, make it easy to know what land is really yours and how far you can really go. Now this however is the end of what i found good.

The bad. The new build your own farm is cool, but do I always want that concrete pad? NO! I don't want it for half the structures I place, the abilty to toggle and change it would be nice. There is alot of equipment that will leave you scratching your head about what it does do to the most vage descriptions they can do. Now the A.I. is a full blown dumbass when it comes to harvesting, Holy crap it cannot drive the forage harvesters to save their lives. If you are not johhny on the spot with a damn tipper they panic, lock up the breaks and have to catch their breath before they start to move again. This is way apperent when working with sugarcane. Isn't it about time we get better control over our workers? Modders please bring back your advanced A.I. controls as the Devs cannot figure it out. A hint to them on this is the A.I. controls from Construction sim 2, where i can tell the  ding-a-ling in the dumptruck to follow the cold planner.

66,46930635,english,"Farming Simulator 19 is almost exactly what we've come to expect from the FS franchise. It's an enjoyably buggy game that gives users full creative expression to build the farm of their dreams. With new features like lime and cotton the game adds more options than it's prededcessor and the developers have obviously listened to the community when it comes to the features that FS17 players wanted to see implimented into the base game. 

Pros: 
-New Crops and livestock allow a more dynamic game, especially in multiplayer
-Multiplayer is VASTLY improved over FS17 with individual farms and bank accounts in the base game.
-""Building your own farm"" gives you a feeling of being more connected to the game than in previous versions.
-Of course... John Deere
-Huuuuge modding community is already hard at work creating new and exciting mods for FS19
-Dev's seem to be receptive to criticism and are currently working to push a patch to fix the known issues.

Cons: 
-It's a Giants game, the initial release is always full of bugs and it takes a few weeks to work out.
-The engine, doesn't seem to be that much different than FS17 and the game mechanics are almost identical
-Controller support is still an issue
-Some features in Multiplayer obviously weren't tested (granting contractor status, doing contracts for AI)
-AI system is still unable to cope with basic obstacles.
-Lots of equipment has issues with mirrors, lights, interior lighting, etc. 
-Giants didn't include ""Seasons"" OR a working GPS in the game. I know I don't speak for the entire world, but of the dozen people I have spoken to about FS19 all of them were dissapointed about these features being absent. 

Overall I think GIANTS has a solid base for what could have been an AMAZING game, but in it's current state it's only ""OK"".

Probably other things but on to the heart of the matter.

This game will go on my virtual ""SHELF"" until several improvements are made (most likely from the modding community).

I am slightly disappointed with Giants they worried to much on getting brands and not enough on game physics either that or the dude doing the friction calculations needs a new pc. The game is quite slippy. I know how to fix it (and did) but pc people always know what to do when a game acts up. Giants spent to much on YouTube’s accolades and not enough on sending real modders a copy so mods flowed on release day. By this I mean the mod content stinks so many tools and things were left out of the starting lineup. For those haters of courseplay and follow me close your eyes and bypass this part but if you own a real farm in real life you have to hire workers and not just to drive in fields having to go back to the home farm over and over to get equipment to a field is stupid and boring. 

The three start levels are very interesting and fun game play is as always. 
The graphics are astounding and a very good step forward.
There are bugs, as always I'm sure Giants will fix them that is one plus they are very active on bugs
Right now selling prices are on the stupid low side, and doing all metric is a turnoff if you want all of the world to love a game make an in game converter.
One of my huge pet peeves is the price drop when dumping product if the dude at the grain elevator did that to me he would face serious consequences like a shotgun? Its  the same price at bushel 1 to bushel 20,000 per contract it does not drop lol

The game is not a copy paste of FS17 I see several dynamics that have changed yes the machines are the same and big deal there’s ""John Deere"" in my part of the USA ole JD has lost a lot of popularity simply because of poor engineering so having it in game is not even close to a deal breaker. And yes I pre ordered the game and not because of JD 
even missing a few good mods the game is fun! It does get boring when moving around only cause it time consuming.

For the money I'm a little disappointed as a farm owner customization is my preference and mine alone and Giants fell short in that department other than that I am quite pleased with the potential for this game and expansion. 

By the way Mr Giants there is more farms in the mid west and mid south  a US map of there would have been a plus but you missed that boat.

1 - Forget the animals. The troughs will miraculously fill by themselves. You supply the feed only once. No point playing. It is beyond me how could they release the game with such a major and obvious flaw.
2 - Loading/unloading/refilling - unlike FS 17, you have to stand by and watch (in most cases). Plain silly.
3 - Hay/grass loading wagon can no longer hire driver. (using the smallest  windrower)
4 - Buying/selling animals - endless clicking, no way to enter a number. Same with borrowing money.
5 - No point to bother with tedders or windrowers. Just put a tiny bit of hay in the loading wagon and collect grass. It will become all hay.

I would say buy this game if you enjoy the series, and like a challenge. the bugs will get worked out in time and it will be a great game to play. Just remember however, the game will get repetitive in time. Farming in real life really doesnt get repetitive because conditions  change every year, however to model that in a game would be impossible lol.

As a previous player of FS17 in its late stage with mods and improvements overall I was expecting with strong influence from the modding world that GIANTS would be including a vast majority of improvements and additions which was added in the modding world to the base of this game. Based on some of the feature and standard access to buildings it seems empty. And literally offers not much more. I’m hell bent on waiting for mods to arrive to patch gaps that are left from my fs17 experience and as many have already said you could go back to fs17 and not really miss fs19 that much. Graphics are a small improvement and some of the in game mechanics and that’s pretty much it not much else.

horses: very demanding but seem to be worth the time investment.
buildings: idea is good. but its terrible to place things. it wants to level the ground every time. want to build a building on a slight hill? no can do you will have to flatten the ground and that will be 100k please....

rain: this allone is worth a dislike.... ""we fixed rain going though buildings"" is what the devs said. but no they dident. not only on placables but also on static items like the shop....

bugs. found quite a few bugs. some of them have been reported a while. some even before launch by youtbers. not quick fixes .... so if steam had a ""in between"" button i would prease that... but cant dislike it ether as I already played 20 hours.

30,46833604,english,I was super disapointed when I started this game. I kind of thought that Giants would have updated some of their processes here in this game. The textures like potatoes and sugar beets are unchanged and flat. The tractor steering is unchanged from FS17 . There are changes needed asthere should be no reason why I should flip my tractor and wagon. Why do I need to mod this on the first day to make it playable? For all the hype of John Deere coming into the game and a intro video that looks good but whem I download the game it is blurry and the detail of a 2015 game. Giants are the biggest software company for the Simulation genre and they come out with an all flash no bang FS19. Thank God STEAM refunded my hard earned money for this game that I pre ordered in Aug 18 and now this 4/10.,1543093755,1543093755,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198030125883,7,1,112,0,112,1543008246,,
31,46833421,english,"Ya know, there is something in common for some or many (I`m not sure about number), or all German games. Or its simulation games only. The main thing - simulation, or core part of game, call it what you want, is done very well, but all secondary things - animation, optimisation, visuals, secondary missions, objectives are horrible. For example - Omsi 2, farming sims... They all missing quite significant parts.

And separately about farming sims - to play this alone without courseplay is hard, boring. And I`ve got nearly all games - 13, 15, 17 and 19. The red line goes through all of them - mods. Only because of mods these games still coming out, and I fear only because of mods they come in shape like they are - unfinished. And always we pay full price. With hope, something will be better this time. And yes, something gets better everytime. But just something. It`s like the path to the ultimate farming simulator - gets better with every new version. How many of these versions gonna be more? I dunno. And i feel pity for poor modders, who has their lives, jobs and all, but everytime they have rebuild their mods to be compatible with new version of game. What will happen when loyal modding community get tired of this? The farming sim will die or we will see the ultimate farming sim? The one we all been waiting for all these years... Hard to say...

Every new game with old illnesses - the help section is nearly useless, it don`t say what you can use to fight weeds for example. Well it`s obvious, you`d say - a weeder! Right. And what are my other options? Having some knowledge in real farming, i understand that using sprayer and herbicide also helps. Other topic - icons. Every new game, everytime a new guide appears with meaning of these icons. Say, does it really hard to add a line of text under the icon??? Will it kill the immersion or what else?

Giants releases only a barebone of game, admit that. With bugs and all. Everytime. Well, I don`t afraid call it a beta version. Modders and players hunting bugs drags it to ""release"". Though money drops into pockets of Giants only. It`s like DYI game - add your mods and play as you like.

Nevertheless all aforementioned, I`d recommend this version. On sale. Or after 6 months. When we have all needed mods and bugs fixed.

Ok, ok, besides all criticism, some good things. I like new graphic additions - tools loosing the paint; more detalised machines, tractors. But again, every FS game I tried it`s like player is in some sort of buble, where nice and cool textures inside, but low poly outside. And the border between both good and bad is so good visible! It was ok for games 5 years back, but today... when I look what breathtaking views are made with Unity... and this. Giants, it`s time to change. And community, it`s time to say we demand the true and only the ultimate farming sim. Enough to feed us with this unfinished ""release"" every few years. Enough to earn money on some enthusiasts free work you gladly take into game.

I like farming sim, I really do. But with every new game I play less and less. I`m afraid i will not buy the next one, if current develpment will stay as it is now.

The mods, the maps, and all the scripting is what really opens these games up anyway.
The graphics are beautiful but need to be re shaded.. The colors are dry and should be more vibrant. Tractor physics are amazing! I love how the game plays, how they drive, and It really has met my expectations minus a few issues so far.

The issues I have had:

-Pallets just out of no where flying off the pallet forks into oblivion. 
-Pallets of fertilizer just falling through the pallet forks all together when I tried to move them to tidy the yard.
-On perfectly square base game fields the helpers don't complete the field in its entirety. (Could be my error)
-The prices are really steep in this game. While I do like the new challenge in FS19, I do think it makes it harder to get into animal work early game, which is what I liked in the previous title.

52,46812402,english,"Ok, so this is my first ever review.

First off, let me say that I am a huge fan of FS series to date.  Particularly FS 17.

But on reflection I now realise that FS17 was great because it created a platform for modders to really up their game.
Now that I'm playing FS19 without mods, I've come to realise that the game is only good with mods. For me anyway.
For me, I like the dynamic of using Courseplay to effectively manage the farm as oppposed to just drive tractors etc.

Why doesnt Giants take ANY advice from its fans? We have been saying for years to add some kind of courseplay replica
to really enhance gameplay. We have also been asking for better ground working physics, more realism. One of the only games I have seen do this is Agriculture Simulator...yes it was an absolute shambolic mess from the get go, but they had the two things FS is missing. A management function AND better ground dynamics.


So heres a few pros and cons:

Pros
-The machinery looks really good. Particularly on High settings.
-There is a real ""weight"" to driving the bigger machines. This is helped by the new steering system too.
-Finally added John Deere. 
-Really interesting ""contracting"" model.

Cons
-The gameplay reminds me of the original FS. The monotony of drawing my own grain etc is creeping in.
-The maps are dogshit. Unimaginative. Badly planned. Again, reminds me of a bygone era of FS.
-There is NO useful infrastructure that you can buy. Couple of sheds and a vehicle workshop.
-4/10 times, my games crashes
-Ground dynamics are literally the exact same as FS17.
-Fuck all new machinery.
-WAAAYYY TOOOO DAAYYUMM EXPENSIVE YOOO

My verdict:

This game had real potential. The build up to release alone had me really pumped to get it. But its just a re-skinned version of FS17.

The physics are worse than ever, pallets either stick to the ground or flip in the air when you try to pick them up,
Logs are indredibly heavy for some reason, forcing you to use logging machines/forks to pick up the tiniest of logs,
The logs have the worst collision I've ever seen in the FS series ; they float when you put them on trailers, won't let you fully close the log fork when picking them up, they'll slide off the machinery at most random times,
The current mission system is so un-rewarding it's not worth doing 90% of the time,
AI is dumber than ever, won't finish half the jobs you start them up and give you ""unkown reason"" as an excuse to stop working,
Lots of reported bug/glitches with Controllers bindings,
The new placeable farm features is incredibly costly should you place something on the tiniest of slope, etc..

Farming Simulator 2019 is a great game with no limits! I'm currently playing in the ""Farm Manager"" mode and it's perfect for me! Starting with ~$125.000 and you don't own anything, of course you need to be a bit finical experienced here but I made it! I'm having fun with the game and play it every day! So many machines, equipment, etc to experience with hundreds of game time left! And if you get bored of the machines, FS19 have great support for mods and a huge modding community! So you will get able to download gamechangers, new machines for FREE by the time being! 
But thanks to the hundereds of machines, equipments etc, you have much to explore before getting bored!

Positives:
Fantastic graphics, physics and envoriment!
Hundreds of licensed machines, equipment and more from over hundered different real brands!
Open-world, you'll do whatever you want from agriculture, forestry, animal care, just driving around or yeah, whatever you want to do!
Fantastic community by the internet including tutorials, let's plays, posts and much more!
Fantastic support for mods and a HUUUUGEEE modding-community!
Many different crops.
The controls are not so different from even back to FS15, (Which was my latest version)
This is not even all, i could sit here the whole day writing positives :D

Negatives:
the driving physics is a bit weird. 
Wait, was that all? ... Hmm, Great game!

As you propably already have telled, i would higly recommend this game for those who are for the types of these games!

If there was an ""unsure"" button to click when recommending games, this is the one I would use for FS2019. Seeing as there isn't, I am going to go with ""Not Recommended"".

I have played for a few hours now, and to be honest I am a little underwhelmed. The graphics may be slightly better, and the machinery more varied, but I am struggling to really find anything new that can really justify a whole new game with a fairly hefty price tag.

The game mechanics seem to have stayed fairly much the same as have the physics. The graphics and HUD may have had a slight improvement maybe but nothing earthshattering. Yeah, they added ""Horses"" and ""Weeding"" but nothing with the potential to blow my socks off.

I was hoping for a larger improvement on the previous titles. Mud? (thinking Spintires here). Greater weather dynamics (snow or ice?). Different terrain (marshland?). Different aspects to the agricultural industry (reclaiming boggy land, use of excavators to install drains, buying heavier lifting equipment to build sheds?) Some of these things do actually exist in the world of farming.

I know I expected too much - although I would have been happy with just a little bit more. Sorry Giants - I have loved your work up until now.

Cons: Workers keep leaving small spots undone, workers won't stop backing up after they get done with a job, machinary resets to shop instead of your farm, too many posts to run into and get stuck, you run out of fuel way too quickly, land is extremely expensive, you get horses but I can't place them anywhere yet, I don't know if it's my computer or not but it started running almost perfectly but now it keeps glitching, It rains a little too much, It's hardly every sunny and clear, I'll run a cultivator that can plant as well but it looks like it just cultivates instead, steering and camera movement are slow, it's really easy to get hit by the train it comes by really fast and you don't get much warning, It's very bumpy, a lot of hills making it harder to turn around, birds flying in and out of your field gets annoying, cones are in the way at the gas station, workers take forever to turn around, and you can't just buy the fields you have to buy the land around the fields as well.

Good:

- Graphics are better at max settings, but still the shadow and plant draw distances suffer.
- The character animations are cool and he actually bounces, moves, presses pedals and steers.
- Some cool new machinery
- Horses are a nice addition and work pretty well.

Bad:

BUGS. At this stage of the game it is clear they did minimal QA testing of the game. Like there is no way they did much at all. Or just didn't care enough to fix it before launch. Either way it's unacceptable. People that haven't run into bugs yet have probably not done much because i have run into a TON of them. The Fliegl bale trailer attaches itself to whatever was loaded on it even after you unload it. so whatever you unload FOLLOWS IT AROUND AND DESTROYS EVERYTHING IN ITS PATH. Bales, pallets, bags it doesnt matter. The tractors get extremely dirty after you drive 20 feet after washing them. WHY EVEN WASH THEM? The terrain deforms so badly when you place a shelter that you cant even drive your equipment into the shelter sometimes. Both included map designs are AWFUL. A lot of fields dont have enough space due to terrain or objects around them to even turn around equipment when working the fields.  there are numerous other problems and this game needs A LOT of work and I don't see a lot of these things getting fixed any time soon or at all. This really sucks because i loved FS17 but this just is NOT FUN in its current rushed, buggy and unacceptable state.

This is a day 1 review, and I will update it as the game is updated:

Pro's
Lighting is vastly improved
New crops are always a great addition
Horses - Good to have another new animal to the game!

Cons
Bugs. Bugs. Bugs. 

Controller support - Before I started the game, I had my joystick hoytas plugged in from another game, plus my controller. I unplugged it, started the game, and the game still wanted to use my hoytas. I had to restart the computer to fix this. Others are reporting that they are having issues with X controller or wheel, but restarting the computer fixes it. I hate to have to restart my computer when I am switching games. Those days were gone when Windows 3.1 came out.

Horses - I guess this is the first attempt, but very derpy controls. Extremely wonky while you are riding. The hitbox is horribly huge, and if you are within what looks like 4 feet of an object, it will block you. You can climb trees with a horse. The idea is solid, but horrible execution.

In Summary:

If you own FS 17, and still play it, I do not recommend this game at this time. If you are new to the series, and just want to farm, then sure, jump on in. If you preordered the game, then you don't need my review to make your choice for you.

Edit 1:  Adding in list of bugs per request. These are not all the bugs I have seen, just the ones I can think of while at work.

Disappearing missions.
Parts of the field ""disappearing"" while harvesting, making it to where you cannot see what you have done, and what you have not done.
Parts of fields not able to be sowed.
Chicken egg boxes not filling because something is within 5 miles of it.
Placeables, everything about them, very buggy
Helper bots occasionally leaving the field they are on and going 3 fields away. (I LOL everytime.)
7.1 sound still doesn't work, even after yesterday's patch that supposedly fixed it.
Other people report crashes, but 25+ hours, I haven't had this.
However, occasionally, the sound get's extremely wonky requiring a restart.
3 times I have tried to connect to my server, but nothing shows on the list. The fix is a restart.
Rollers don't create grass that grows. (might be intentional, but they won't say. I can see reasons for and against this being intentional)

Yes it has less vehicles, yes it has a bug or another, but it's the first week and let's face, who used all the vehicles in fs17 anyway?

The game is the best software I know that has an impressive mod tools and compatibility, with time the garage will grow (I played FS17 with 1200 mods without error!)

Pros:
- Game engine revamped (better graphics but requires better hardware)
- New brands (John Derre, american semi trailers, etc)
- A dog, horses
- Build your own farm (pleaceables)
- Buy land instead of fields
- More realistic behavior of machines (but still no gearbox)
- New crops (Oat, Cotton)
- Dynamic hoses and dashboard illumination (finally!)

Cons:
- Seasons will take a while to appear
- A lot of brands didn't return (in my opinion is just a matter of time till some mods conversions start appearing)
- There isn't much pleaceables (mods will take care of that)
- No multiterrain angle in vanilla (why giants, why?)
- Vanilla maps lack realism and appeal (mods will take care of that too)
- Some bugs (still first week guys)

30,46550808,english,"Let me start by saying, this is a thumbs up if, and only if, youve never purchased another Farming Simulator title. If you own 2017 or 2015, this is essentially a texture pack. 

2019 introduces new concepts that are a much needed additon. The ability to actually BUILD your farm from the ground up with buildings is a step forward for sure. This is severly limited, however. There is only one house, and from what I saw, usable barn. Everything else is just for show. This means that early game, you'll have to shell out $350k just to sleep through the night. 

The new map, while pretty, is an absolute nightmare to navigate. Are you sure this is set in the US? I dont think there is a straight road anywhere on it. You could skip off to the shop in like 2 minutes if you didnt have to wind your way there for 10 minutes and then wind your way back again. 

Horses are also a new addition and a welcome one, however, I gave up before ever getting close to affording them. Several hundred thousand for a barn, the horses themselves and then equipment for feed, bedding, etc. Animals are still a distinct late game asset. 

The game is on a new engine. Somehow, someway, the physics are still the same. Floaty, zero weight and the same ""violently stick to everything"" collisions. The new engine has only put a fresh coat of paint on the same frame. I have said it before and I will say it until I give up this hobby; A pretty game does. not. make. a. good. game. by. default. The same physics bugs that existed 5 years ago? Still here. Look at Stardew Valley. Its 2D sprites and has more heart in two pixels than this game does in its entire...however many gigs this thing ate up. 

The big issue that I take with this series and this company is they insist on releasing a new game every two years. In some cases there is little change. 2013 to 2015 I dont even remember there being a change. I swear they released the same game. I really really wish, Giants would do what Train SImulator does. Minus the egregious DLC of course. That is just keep updating the same game every so many years. I wouldnt mind paying for DLC over a span of time if i knew that, in two years, I wouldnt have to start over again. Hell the grind to get anywhere can take two years. 

THAT is the big thing. The grind. Now I know, thats the point and yes I agree but when you realize that you are just going over your field for an hour to disc it up, then another hour to plant the crop, then another hour to fertilize it and finally another hour harvesting only to IMMEDIATLY start the process over again. Ive been playing this series since 2011 and that has not changed in all that time. The core game has stayed the same since then. There is no urgency, no risk for failure. Did I plant that crop at the right time? Does it have enough time to grow before winter? What winter? You are locked in an endless summer. 

There is no strategy. Throw some seeds into the ground and harvest them when they are done. You WILL succeed. You have to try to fail. This series would benefit so greatly from a seasonal rotation. One of my favorite farming games when I was a kid would give you a final tally at the end of every year to see how you did. There had to be strategy, you couldnt just plant and harvest, plant and harvest, plant and harvest. 

2019, is just a slap of paint and the ability to build the farm. Sort of. You get to place where things go anyway. Sort of. But all those placeables from previous games? Gone. No beehives, no greenhouses, no solar panels. Essentially, things that made you money passivley are now gone. It feels like any ease of grind feature bit the dust. One of the strangest for me personally was the removal of flatbed trailers. Which means now, whenever you buy pallets of seeds or fertilizer or feed or what have you, you have to lug them. One by one. With a forklift back to base. A ten minute drive there and a ten minute one back for however many pallets you needed. 

TLDR
If you own another title, dont bother, its not worth $35. If you are just getting into the series, then that is the only way I can recomend buying this title. Just expect it to be replaced in two years.

Graphics look really nice and the game runs smooth with my FX-8350 and GTX970, grass/bushes etc. need fixing, as they come through trailers and tractor cabins. Lighting is also pretty weird, not sure about SP, but in MP the light changes feel like im playing minecraft. Cabin animations and details are very nice also. Vehicle handling with keyboard is pretty similar to FS17, but little bit better.

Money making in the game is really problematic right now and I hope there will be a fix for it. I like how you need to purchase new areas for both field work and forestry, but income from crops and contract work compared to the land prices and amount of work you have to do are just too far away from each other. Animal pens are also just too expensive, if you don't play in easy mode or cheat the money. In FS17 we had free animal pens and little bit overpriced animals but it was okay, now we have to pay hundreds of thousands for the animal pens with smaller income. 

I've played both maps, Felsbrunn in SP, Ravenport in MP. Both are nice, but don't feel like maps I would like to put hundreds of hours of gameplay. What comes to forestry, both of these maps are pretty bad for large scale Ponsse action (if you don't plant trees and wait for a quite some time).


Good game, will keep playing. Has some minor graphics/light problems, lots off stuff from FS17 missing.

I keep wanting to play FS 17 each time I play FS 19...

But everytime I go back to FS 17 there is something that pulls me back to FS 19.

I was playing the other night and thought: 
Man, they dont have passive income like wind turbines and honey in FS 19...
BUT you can place animal pens ANYWHERE! How cool is that!!! (honestly this level of customization is a huge boon for me)

FS 19 just doesnt FEEL better than 2017 for some reason, but it does have some interesting things to offer. 

Does it innovate? not particularly but when do annual, or bi-annual release games really innovate??
Do the graphics make me feel like i am there? no, but they are no worse than FS 17

Is it worth spending the 35 dollars on?? 

well that depends, I am happy i purchased it simply because i feel more in control of the farm. 

I can place pens where i want.
I can start the game with equipment handed to me, or just the cash to buy a decent setup, or barely any cash at all and start from nothing. 

It isnt a long list of boons, but seeing how FS 2017 and FS 2019 are quite similar, these are enough to keep me booting up 2019 instead of 2017. 

Personally I am happy with the purchase, but its tenuous.

54,46508525,english,"The big question you ask, is it worth upgrading from my hard drive full of mods and FS17 to FS19? 

All in all, Yes. 

Improvements to subtle things like keeping loads on trailers to the more obvious like improved graphics and more end game fun. Some great effort has been applied to the equipment. stop and look close to the details, stuff like hoses connecting, fan belts turning, Sky effects, investments into new brands without a DLC buy in. these are why you will buy it.. over time your hard drive of FS17 mods will convert to FS19 and you will have a much better foundation to do whatever you like to do. Until then, grab a few beers, log on with a few friends and just have fun. 

is it amazing? No, Well not yet.. The core farms on the release dont match the pre-launch trailer. well other than the John deer tractor, nothing in the trailer is in the game. even the lizard pick up is lesser. The default maps are just ok, some great spots but overall restrictive in your ability to use all the new gadgets and animal placeables. The maps have no covered parking with the exception of 3 steel carports you can place. (a wood one if you play in EU) Barns and garages are static and useless. you can clearly see they put the effort into the equipment and visuals. most will ignore the default maps as soon as someone puts one out or you use the editor to modify it heavily.

66,46499835,english,"TLDR: Exact same gameplay mechanics as previous Farming Simulator series titles. Just a much prettier wrapper, additional crop, animals, and a handful of popular previous mod offerings built into the game such as crop destruction.

It's definitely worth it if you're an FS enthusiast. The game world seems much more real and alive. You can see storms approaching in the distance, have crows following your seeders/harvesters, hear the blaring horn of passing trains, watch your crops sway in the wind, ect. The game world is truly alive now.

Other than that though, in all honesty, it's pretty much the same game just with a prettier wrapper.

It comes with two built-in maps and one optional map that was previously a paid DLC from FS 17;  Estancia Lapacho. Of the two built-in maps, Ravenport supposedly represents the USA but for some reason the devs turned it into a giant junkyard. Even the farmhouse looks like an abandoned trash heap, almost as if the dev's were deliberately giving a middle finger salute to their American players.

The game has many features that can be toggled on or off depending on just how much you want the game to feel like a struggle; crop withering, vehicle grime, crop destruction when driving over it, required periodic plowing, lime enrichment, weed control, ect.

The job system was revamped so that it's not an instant ATM anymore. Now you have to use or lease your own equipment to do jobs for others.

You can now build your own farming home base from the ground up, placing various buildings, sheds, and silo's in whatever layout you want, but the very limited amount of flat land will still pretty much dictate choices for you.

A lot of things were made harder in the game; you still have to dump certain crops on the ground instead of silo's or storage bins like in previous FS games, you have to buy and transport seed and fertilizer from the store, vehicle maintainance is a non-disableable requirement now, and you can't store silage at biogas plants anymore unless you own them.

I'm sure that mod authors will bring in a lot of quality of life improvement mods to make life easier for us such as placeable seed and fertilizer depots, all-inclusive silo's, ect, but, and probably the biggie, there probably won't be a GPS mod for this version since the author is now employed by a rival game development house.

So it's a hit and miss recommendation. The world is very beautiful and alive, but more difficult to justify as a casual gaming experience anymore due to the increased difficulty and demands on your time and resources to get anything done. Your mileage may vary compared to earlier versions of the game.",1542941190,1542941331,True,14,0,0.638865113258361816,0,True,False,False,76561198050433002,237,84,3321,0,714,1544427820,,

Fiind un fan al acestui joc , abia am asteptat sa se lanseze , am facut precomanda si numaram zilele pana la lansare.... Iata ziua cea mare a sosit , este 20.11.2018 , am descarcat jocul... iar din acel moment... de cand am apasat butonul de start al carierei... am ramas cu un gust amar... ""nu se poate , asta sa fie?"" ma uitam la cer (in game) si in gandul meu spuneam...""norii astia zici ca-s pictati de un copil de 3 ani"" asa vad eu acest update adus mediului inconjurator in FS 19 si anume ""dynamic clouds"" .Trecand peste asta mi-am achizitionat un tractor  si un combinator , am condus tractorul pana in fata combinatorului si am observat acea enervanta notificare prin care iti arata ca trebuie sa apesi pe tasta ""Q"" ca sa atasezi acel utilaj ""numele sau"" (nu m-am obosit sa retin numele combinatorului) ok ... dar tractorul se afla la un unghi de aprox 30 de grade fata de combinator , nu era perfect pozitionat in cat sa pot atasa combinatorul la tractor. Iar cand am apasat pe tasta ""Q"" , se atasaja combinatorul la tractor...iar acest proces de atasare rezulta un mic bug....prin care tractorul este aruncat in partea dreapta...si se rastoarna.. :))) . Ok sa trecem mai departe , am trecut peste acea faza si imi continui drumul spre o parcela aflata langa ferma , acea trebuia cultivata. Am ajuns cu tractorul pe parcela respectiva si am lasat lucratorul automat sa-si ""faca treaba""...oarecum... eu nu eram atent la ce face el acolo , eram ocupat cu explorarea shopului.... cand m-am intors sa vad ce face... el lucra pe parcela vecina care nu era amea , sper sa pot pune poza sa vedeti :))
 Nu a durat nici o ora interactiunea mea cu jocul ca sa-mi creez o parere asa de proasta in legaturca cu FS 19 , un joc asa de asteptat de catre mine , am jucat fiecare versiune de FS de la FS 2008 pana la FS 19 dar FS 19 m-a dezamagit total prin grafica sa , prin bugurile sale numeroase , undele modele nu se imbina cu altele . 
 Ca o prima impresie ...nu este ceea ce m-am asteptat sa fie , este un joc ""ieftin"" care putea sa fie foarte bun , cei de la GIANTS au experienta in acest joc...stie ce trebuie sa faca dar in aceasta versiune au dat-o in bara. Ideea din FS 19 este buna , sa poti incepe in trei moduri diferite sa fi capabil sa iti modifici ferma asa cu.m vrei... sunt multe chestii prin care au modificat jocul , mai puteau sa adauge pamant dinamic cu.m e in Cattle and Crops si multe altele.
 Eu nu as fi fost asa de dezamagit de joc daca il finisau , daca ii rezolvau bugurile...hai ca acceptam norii , ce sa faci si cu ei... pureau sa amane data de lansare cu o luna sau doua , nu era problema de asta. Dar in daca ce lansezi jocul in halul asta , in stagiul asta de constructie , sunt sigur ca jocul este cam 80% daca nu mai putin terminat , mai aveau mult delucru la el dar asta a fost sa fie.
 Cu aceasta versiune lansata imi pare rau sa fac acest comentariu negativ despre joc si imi pare rau sa zic ca si-au pierdut un fan... :(

74,46491252,english,"Thought I’d just put my thoughts out there amongst these very mixed reviews. I’ve been playing FS since the very first one, almost a decade ago now, and I don’t agree with ‘the biggest advancement in the series’ - I think FS15 takes that one, although there are a lot of very welcome changes here. Anyway;

Visuals, Models & Environment
Graphics are the best they’ve ever been and the lighting is just as good. The vehicle models also look excellent, and details like moving pedals and seat suspension are very nice. The new maps are very detailed, if a bit smaller than usual. I haven’t tried many of the larger harvesters yet, but I suspect navigating some of the small roads to and from my farm will be challenging. I like the added touches such as crops bending under machinery and birds landing in fields.

Physics and Vehicles
The physics engine seems to have been overhauled and seems more realistic than before - something which is especially noticeable in suspension. I think acceleration and power has been greatly improved - the vehicles are much less jerky than before. FS19 has the largest vehicle roster of the series so far, and it’s great to see so much faithfully reproduced machinery. I know many fans will be very pleased about the addition of John Deere - I’m glad it’s in the game now but I wasn’t crying out for it before.

Gameplay
There are a few new gameplay mechanics and a few new smaller things too. I like the new starting modes - Beginner, Farm Manager, and Start from scratch, giving a bit more than just Easy, Medium, Hard. I like the new land purchasing system that gives more customisation options with buildings etc. However, I do think a lot of the placeables are way overpriced, such as the farm house (which doesn’t serve much more than a decorative purpose), and especially animal enclosures. Tens of thousands for a chicken coop, which is effectively a small shed and some fencing is too much. It’s good to see even more crops being added, such as cotton (quite a high-end crop as only the £350k+ module plus can harvest it) and oats. Weeds and lime are nice as they seem to make the crop cycle a little less rinse-and-repeat, and can be disabled if you like. Horses are a nice addition, but I’m not sure I’ll get much use out of them. I’d prefer to travel around by pickup or Gator, and I’d rather farm cows or sheep. I think the new menus look much slicker, and I like that the vast amount of machinery has finally been split into more sub-categories (particularly tractors).

Frustrations, Issues & Bugs
- There seems to be an issue with the ambient light mechanic where it will not fade smoothly between times of day - instead just jumping to different light levels.
- I have experienced some vehicle bugs, specifically where vehicles are jerky at low speeds (more so in reverse) and their wheels seem to lock up occasionally. 
- As I mentioned above, some of the placeables are unreasonably expensive
- I use the Saitek wheel and side panel, and for some reason all of the default button mapppings are different in FS19 to what they were in FS17, and FS19 seems to not save my deadzone settings...

To conclude, yes, there are issues, as with every launch, but I’m sure GIANTS will iron those out in due course.

Simply terrible game experiece !
Lots of placeables from FS17  are missing,  
and same for some equipment..

i can't see nowhere that advertised stunning graphics, 

here and there  is worse than in FS17 !!

whole game is FULL of BUGS of all kinds,

 can-t even say if there is some Force Feedback !

the horse can simply climb EVERYWHERE, except on 90 degree walls !!!

the horses movement is not realistic at all. (but better then nothing)

And the most annoying: when you start driving, there is a delay of 1,5 till 2,5 seconds until your tractor moves.

I wanted to start a farm from scratch, but the number of buildings are extremely limited, the terraforming is bad and I can't even make simple roads or put fences (something that every farm has) . Why?
At least we know that better terraforming IS coming and that modders will add a lot of buildings.

Maybe in a next release a version will come that uses even a beter engine ( like  cryengine, creation engine... - as example).
The machines are nice worked out as the sound.

In these times where they could made it more real open world, meaning make all doors working on houses, barns, light switches etc.
Train your horses ...sure just riding them, as it sure would be easy to make it ride and do some more Equestrian chalenges that give extra value on your horses when you do them.

The MOD community will sure come up with nice maps, stables and more features.
Will take time but is worth to wait, try en enjoy.

Overall again a improvement and mod community will sure have again fun on making new stuff for it :).
Most people i know playing the previous releases of the game use ton of mods.
 
As the developers did thank the modders well a big thanks as well from me for all modders out there looking out for your new mods and have fun making them. There more options i bet for modders then the previous  releases . Show your skills peeps :)

O how could i forget, why not now having the mods via the  steamworkshop  .. there a few good mod sites but there 100's F..... with only goal of advertising other stuff and hotlinking mods from there base site. Might stimulate Modders as well i guess .

19,45906299,english,"Tl; Dr; The developers spent more budget on their shiny, CGI trailer instead of actually improving this game from previous itterations. 

When I think Farm Sim 2019 after having put a few hours in, a few words come to mind. Bugs, frustration, and regret.
The bugs. Oh god, the bugs.
  Driving a massive piece of machinery should feel powerful. You should feel that the fragile world around you could not possibly handle having you bump into it for fear of crushing whatever it is you hit into tiny, unrecognizable pellets. Oh, but Farm Sim 2019 has a different philosophy! Driving down the road, and you bump into a small hatchback car in your 20,000lb tractor? HIT THE F#$^ING BRAKES.
   Thats right, every object in this game you run into stops you dead in your tracks quicker than a pedophile at a PTA meeting. And thats just vertical objects. Driving a trailer and you try and drive over and unfortunately shaped bump? Well guess what you're resetting that trailer to the store and picking it up because it's not moving otherwise. 
   Many of the vehicles dont operate well anyways so don't even think about buying anything other than a tractor. Forestry is a joke since the developers have no clue how to design objects you can pick up with a crane effectively, logs are surrounded by massive invisible hitboxes that cause craning them to feel more rigged than a crane game at chucky cheese. Skid steers are absolutely useless. A vehicle that is supposed to be able to turn on the spot requires you to be moving forward to turn, completely negating its entire purpose. 
   For a game that can't seem to handle hills, boy, did they put a lot of hills in it. Driving a vehicle from A to B when any little post, hill, or painfully obvious looping NPC vehicle stops you immediately is just agonzing. And you may say, ""But hey, you can turn traffic off so why complain?"" And I would say, if traffic is so god awfully unfinished, why include it in a game and then call the game version 1.0?

   Honestly, I could spend HOURS pointing out every single issue with this game, because for every hour I spend in it, I find ten hours worth of issues that any development company worth their office space would have squashed during testing, but hey, who needs testing when you can just spend all your money on trailers and advertising and JOHN DEERE LICENSING.
Hey, I get it, companies are greedy and that probably cost a lot of money, and I get it, it's amibtious to try and make a big ol' game where you can do a bunch of stuff. But Giants puts out games almost every year and they are almost the exact same game every year without improving issues I saw back in Farm Sim 2015. These bugs aren't new. They aren't getting fixed. Don't kid yourself. The engine this game is built upon is deeply flawed and has not been changed by 2 bits in 4 years. 

Farm like never before? No. More like ""Farm the exact same way and just keep giving us more money every year""",1542674862,1542918343,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,76561198000117133,296,39,3765,0,1013,1576023470,,

Graphics - These are top notch and the improvements actually make you want to change to the in-tractor views now.

Gameplay - I like the change on steering to give some weight to it and responsiveness, it makes it more realistic. The approach to have to buy land instead of just buy a field is also a nicer approach. They also redesigned the menu systems and it made things much more intuitive with the new categories for the shop. Having Vehicles and Tools is so much easier now to find things than these huge lump categories before. 

Bugs - I have only experienced two minor ones and both could be fixed on my end by simply restarting a harvester that got stuck trying to turn in a tight area and cultivating a small section mysef that was missed by the helper. The game came out two days and given  that there have yet to be any showstopper issues, I'd say they have done a fantastic job here.

I'll still begrudgingly click the recommend button because I think the game is still good, I think it's still playable, but it's a disgusting excuse for a release version game.  

They seem to be working on implementing some of the things the community wants, albeit very slowly, in small changes every couple years.....it's pretty easy to tell what we want, just watch the most downloaded mods.......literally every game, the community is adding the same things over and over.  

Long story short, if you're someone patient with bugs by all means pick it up, this game is a good addition to the series, it's not as big a step as you're probably hoping it would be, but it's worth the upgrade.

If bugs bother you wait on this title, it's riddled with them

68,46387443,english,"Let me just start out saying that I do think FS19 is worth the cost. There is a lot of new tractor's and stuff to do in the game, But it does not feel like a new game. Think of FS19 as a updated FS17 with loads of new content.

John Deere is a welcomed addition, But limited in it's lineup, However major props for the S790, That was a big suprise. Not to mention new tractor's from Fendt and other popular brands.
New crop types are also good to see. Cotton being the stand out here. It's very different to harvest and fun.
Seeing new animals come to the game has also been exciting. Horses look great and with it's own gameplay around them. Being able to ride a horse and use it as transportation around the map, To having mans best friend by your side as you walk around your yard.

My Pros;

Building from stratch! 
This is fantastic. I've never really liked how a map made you start at one set area. Only so many garages for you to use, and unable to move where you wanted.

Multiplayer Tools!
Giant's have done a outstanding job here. Features we have needed for years. The farming community is large and multiplayer is where you'll find endless fun working together. These new features will allow 4 small groups of people to work together on a map, or challenge eachothers farms, all without needing mods to handle your farms money or property.

New lighting & engine updates.
It's just that, Updates. The game looks gorgous there is no doubt about that. You will see the difference but in my opinion, FS17 still holds up today. However it's a big upgrade and shows.

Lots of new small misc additions!
Just going to group all of it here, From seeing your avatar bounce around in a tractor's seat, To seeing your implements hydraulic & power cables connect to your tractor. It greatly improves realisem while playing. 
Some other core mod features have made it into the game this time around as well, From maintenance on your machines, to crop destruction. 
There is really a ton of little changes like this that greatly improves the game. 

My Cons;

Still NO ground deformation! 
It was rumored this feature just wasn't ready yet. It's a shame we need to wait another 2 years for FS21 to find out if they will have it. This is by FAR my biggest problem with the game. Field work is arguably 70% or more time spent in game. The tractor's look beautiful but the ground textures, though greatly improved still is the games big weakness in my opinion. 
It can kill realism completely. Painting on the almost flat ground texture is just not fun to look at, and absolutely no gameplay there to manage how you take care of your fields.
Did it just rain? No problem, You wont get stuck just go out there and sow, plow, hell even harvest. It's fine........ 

No Terraforming!
Being able to build your farm by scratch is amazing! But not being able to terraform land prior to building often makes for some interesting land placement when you've bought a few buildings. 
The two new maps have less then 1% flat ground I think, And trying to get into your silo you placed that now raised land around it by 50 feet is challenging to say the least.. 
It takes a bit to get use to it and even after you sell something the land stays the same. This just sucks, and can completely ruin your map if not careful.

My Thoughts;

It's a fantastic game, and if you enjoyed FS17 you'll be right at home here with the vast amount of new content. But I wouldn't be in a rush to buy it. There is many holes in the game so to speak, By that I mean lack of brand line up tractor's and equipment. 
It's almost impossible to only use one brand on your farm. Case is the only one that really has a flushed out lineup. 
John Deere for instant has a great lineup of small / medium tractors. But without the 9R series, You wont be pulling that seed hawk on a 50 acre field. Meanwhile you have the best Harvester they make! 

Mods will fix most of these smaller complaints. But Giant's by now should be able to do this stuff on their own. And mod's are not always top quaility, But for most all of us it's the only way to fill gaps in our favorite brands, and fix many of the core problems with the game.

Seasons mod was by far one of the best mod's I used in FS17, It changes the game completely and how you play. It's a shame Giants didn't get this done for FS19, But again mods will fill in here. 

Overall, I feel like Giants moved the farming simulation game one step forward again, But baby steps. Hopefully with FS21 they take a leap and maybe do a new engine, or at the very least give us more control over terraforming, and most importantly REAL ground physics.

I highly recommend the game if you; Loved FS17 and want a major update. Or play with a group of friends.",1542906718,1542907001,True,1,0,0.530201315879821777,0,True,False,False,76561197962983892,250,9,21460,1453,2566,1601949248,,

The graphics are indeed noticeably better. It's not night and day, but lots of little details that add up. Specifically, I love that the crops react visibly to being run over, and that a group of birds (an unkindness of birds?) will ocassionally fly out of the way of my tractor.

There are also several new crops. Sure, you could get these with mods before, but now they're built-in, so now philistines like me can enjoy them without the need to install purpose-built maps, complex scripts, etc...

Sheep have been dropped from the game (horses 'replace' them), and if you compare this game to the previous one, the available vehicle roster has massively shrunk despite the advertising promises, more buildings have become more useless (Big red barn from the trailer? It's in there, you just can't open the doors or store anything inside. It literally only is there to take up space on the map), the (at time of writing) available maps are tiny compared to available maps previously and there is little to no improvement in graphics.
Sadly it took me over 2 hours just to get the game running with my Logitec steering wheel (figuring out why the main memu kept scrolling) so I cannot get a refund from Steam. I have not been past the main menu for 2  to 2.5 hours of my playing time: steam only gives refunds within 2 hours. WHICH IS TOO SHORT to decide if you want to keep ANY game. These are swindler practices, and isn't how any store or company should conduct business. 2 hours refund time and in two hours not being able to get past the main menu because of a bug is simply unacceptable. I was under the impression that Valve and Giants software were companies that cared about making good products for us gamers, but sadly I was mistaken.

I am still waiting for a reply for my email to the Giants software helpdesk where I asked help for fixing the main menu scrolling bug two days later.

I have literally pissed away money buying this game! DO NOT MAKE THIS SAME MISTAKE! If you already have FS17, stick to that. If you don't have a farming simulator game yet, buy FS 17. FS 19 has no improvements over 17, in fact it has LESS content since they removed sheep completely from the game.

Actually, go and buy the game of the competitor. And then not via Steam.",1542900353,1542900353,False,6,0,0.51533740758895874,0,True,False,False,76561198112233935,49,7,525,0,435,1596972912,,
0,46343985,english,"I've been playing since 13, and I was really excited about 19. It's... ok, I guess, but I was also very let down once I noticed the following:

-Graphics that DIDN'T improve. It looks exactly like 17 with brighter light sources and more contrast (This is with all graphic settings on maximum). People have mentioned there are better shadows as well, but I'm not seeing anything that looks better, or even ""more realistic""

-Why do they (Giants) always remove vehicles and implements from the game? I feel like whatever was in the game in 13 should stay there in every future version while they simply add more. No one would complain about that. Furthermore, they revamped the store menu because there are now more types of implements. For example, you can now purchase 2 different small models of something called a ""powered harrower"". Cool! But it's really just a cultivator with a slightly different look. The same can be said for a few other implements. I find that very pointless, and it doesn't really add anything to the game when those implements only do 3-6 meters of work. The option of using different implements should INCREASE as you upgrade to bigger and better equipment. It seems like all of the choices are in the small implements, and you just keep making money until you get to that one best implement at the top of the price range.

-There doesn't seem to be any way to lock objects onto the ONE lowloader trailer. In 17, I thought it was ridiculous to only have two lowloader trailers, and now they've taken one away as well as take away the functionality to strap things down or just lock it to the trailer in general. I could be wrong about that, but I'm not seeing the option anywhere. The trailer in the game is the exact same trailer that was in 17, but somehow it doesn't work nearly as well. When you extend or retract it, the objects on the trailer do not follow with it. They just stay in place while the trailer slides underneath. If you have a load of pallets on the trailer and go around a corner at any speed, the pallets go flying and you're stuck cleaning up the mess Giants has created for you.

-They have removed functional placeable objects, like the windmill and greenhouses, in favor of adding non-functional placeable objects that look like garbage. Furthermore, the default maps have practically nowhere to put any of these objects.

I still recommend this game because of the mods that will be released over time. These are just a few of my biggest complaints. I know the modding community will always deliver the game we all really wanted. What really bugs me is that I feel like Giants has jumped onto the paid add-on bandwagon. They've given us a enough to have a semi-decent game, and they'll fix all of the bugs as they did in 17, but everything in the future will cost extra money. Just look at the add-ons for 17. This will be happening with 19 as well. Maybe they'll give us the placeable objects, but we'll have to pay extra for them. Maybe they'll give us bigger versions of the new equipment types, but we'll have to pay extra. I won't be doing that. I paid my fair $35 for their mediocre work, and now I'll sit back and wait until the modding community digs in and makes this game spectacular. They always do.

18,46312940,english,"I've played the game from Farming Simulator 15 and sadly the same issues persist in this title too.

These issues are fixable and should have been addressed to drive the series forward in innovative ways.

Firstly, the main issue is the control scheme.  The default mouse and controller sensitivity is as low as to require either a lot of space to move the mouse around or aggravatingly long control stick movements.  Even with the sensitivity increased to 200% the maximum it still moves rather slowly.

If that wasn't poor enough, the configuration of controls, instead of being grouped are in a complete list format so unless you are aware of or can test each vehicle type for the axis controls it has, there's no easy way to change to bindings in order for easier control of different vehicle types such as cranes and telehandlers.

While managing the settings on a trailer bed or harvester is easy enough, the physics also leave a lot to be desired with invisible bounding boxes where there's no reason for them to be, such that moving heavy items around and loading them on to trailers is a chore rather than the experience this game should be delivering to its players.  There are also reports of people facing issues with their dedicated controller set ups that worked wonders in Farming Simulator 17, which makes it even stranger for Giants to drop the ball so incredibly hard.

Further there are extra crop types but still you buy one box of seeds and magically switch to what you want those seeds to be.  Certainly ease of use and quality of life but an option for stock control would be nice to have in a simulator.  There's also a very limited selection of vegetables, where as I would love to see fields of brassicas alongside the wheat and potato fields.

Hopefully content of this type will be released in a further expansion, even more hopefully that expansion will be free to justify a full price game that doesn't actually have that new game feel.

I really want to recommend this game but until the control scheme is easier to manage and the strength and sensitivity of axis are addressed I sadly cannot in good faith do so.

If you already own any other games in the series - stick to them. There really is no improvement with FS19. The maps are quite poorly designed. Game looks nothing like the launch trailer (to be expected, as most trailers are pre-rendered nowadays) - but you can't shake the feeling that this is a quickly done repackage with more contrast and a different lighting setup. 

The controls were a little clunky and sluggish to respond, even when configured properly. None of the newer mechanics like farm building were explained, or had key configurations or tutorials or tooltips for them. When I did figure it out, the result was quite underwhelming, as there's little variety, and you seem to only have a very small area to place things - unless you put them in the middle of a paddock - with no roads. 

Ravenport, the new US map is very poorly designed, full of hills and tight alleyways. Getting anything from the store to my farm was a real challenge, as machinery just didnt fit, taking the roads back - or when it did, I'd run in to some physics bug launching me 20m in the air. 

At nearly $50 AUD - I cannot recommend this, especially if you already have any other FS games. You'll get a better experience playing those, and modding it to your liking.

some parts of vehicles to shiny.

72,46196523,english,"Although this game does have its fair share of hiccups, the honest truth is that im having a lot of fun. I played a lot of FS15 and a decent amount of FS17 and this does seem like a considerable improvement. Here are some of the pros and cons that seem to make the biggest difference to ME.

Pros:
- Contracts (missions) are MUCH better. Some of the improvements here involve the ability to leave them and come back, the ability to put workers on contracts, and the ability to use your own equipment for an increased reward. Best thing here though is that there are now multipart contracts (for example mow a feild and then bale everything). Transportation contracts are also back.
- Ability to place all farm buildings, animal pens, and silos, this means not being locked into certain parts of the map (but dont get too excited yet. We'll come back to this one in the cons)
- Ability to truely start from scratch. This is made possible by the ability to buy the farm buildings
- Vehicle degradation mechanic is now much better (and no daily costs for vehicles/tools) Vehicles lose horsepower as they degrade, but they can be easily repaired. (I hated how this used to work in 17 so this was a big plus for me)
- The shop. Everything about the shop is great, you can now customize vehicles with a great preview screen to see how your changes will actually look on the vehicles.
- Felsbrunn. In general I quite like this map. I didn't really like either base map in 17 and never bothered to mod in a new one. 
- Graphics. Great lighting, great models.
- Map seems a LITTLE bit more alive with the addition of the birds 
- Game runs very smoothly (for me and my friends at least)
- Dog. This dog is kinda meh, but I just like dogs in general :)
- Horses. They bring a cool new way to interact with and make money with animals. I like the Diversity
- John Deere. Looks like they finally got the rights to this brand.
- Cotton. It's a little different from basic grain crops, I like the diversity. 

Cons:
- The new placeable buildings are not implemented very well. They pretty much require perfectly 100% flat land, but the devs have a fetish for hills and slopes and pretty much any terrain that doesnt work very well with the new placeable buildings system. The only flat place is the area where they have the farm in the mode where you start with a prebuilt farm... so much for not being limited to certain parts of the map.
- Not really any decent places on either of the maps to put the animal enclosures.
- The new starting modes (New farmer, Farm manager, and Start from scratch) replace the old easy, medium hard. I think you should be able to choose what you start with independently from what diificulty you want to play on. For example, starting from scratch on with easy economonic difficulty or starting with a premade farm on hard.
- They still havent fixed the physics, most notably for logs and pallets
- They removed all passive income placeables such as solar panels, windmills, and greenhouses (although im sure modders will fix this one). But just why?? I always liked having a few to offset my daily costs, if some people dont like how they work, they could have just chosen to not use em.
- A lot of stuff (vehicles, tools, ect.) is gone from the shop that used to be there in 15 and 17. Once again, modders will surely tackle this problem pretty quickly, and I cant honestly complain because there was a lot more added to the shop than removed.

All said and done, im having more fun here than i did on FS17. Theres a lot of stuff i love, and most of my problems with the game wont be too difficult to work around in one way or another. Also, it seems like the devs are trying to work on improving the placeables just a little bit at least.

83,46183063,english,"Spent 700 hours on FS15 and FS17 and was very much looking forward to FS19 but it has been disappointing to say the least.

With great anticipation I loaded it up for the first time entering a strange character creation screen. It's all a bit whatever, theres nothing really there that made me want to spend time making a character...  So into the game i go, $1.25 million in the bank, lets build this farm!!

That is where my heart sinks once i have my first attempt of placing buildings.  It is one of the most frustrating building experiences i have had.  The game does it's own terrain deforming when you place a building and majority of the time looks terrible as its so steep.  After restarting the game 5 times to get the farmhouse in a spot that looks organic, next mission is the silo and storage sheds.  Same problem, the ground deforms, creating steep edges on the edge of the placeable making it look shocking.  I delete a shed to move it over a little and the damn ground stays the same height and with an ashphalt texture....

Now Im pissed off and have to restart the game because i havent saved it before buying each placeable.  I havent even driven a vehicle yet and Im cursing Giants for such a poor building system.  This was one of their major features and it sucks.  There is 3 sheds to choose from down on the number we had in FS17.  There is no more passive money making placeables like the solar panels, wind turbine etc.  I used to use these to offset my vehicle costs as a lot of others did...

So after about 10 - 20 restarts i finally have a decent looking farm and Im done with the placables, what a nightmare.  Time to buy some vehicles....  Get my first tractor with a front end loader and start attempting to configure the controls.  This is where I get pissed off again.  If you set invert Y axis it only does it on foot not in the vehicle.  So I change the vehicle look stick allocation and that fixes it.  Or so I thought.  Now its bugging out when I try use the front loader arm and I cant look around.  Have to exit the vehicle and get back in to be able to look around again.
Its at this point i have to take a break after 2 hours playing to calm down.  Im thinking to myself wtf have they done to FS??

I perservered for another 4 hours of game time and i've made up my mind now.  Its a thumbs down from me at this time.  Too many bugs make it a frustrating experience and it needs patching ASAP.  The new UI sucks, the icons for grain types makes it so hard to know what is what. You have to constantly change between menu screens to figure out what you're planting or selling.  Also why has the tractor tool selection icon been moved up to the top left corner by itself?  Leave it down with the speedo!!! I've also found the lack of trailers annoying.  There isnt a single flatbad for loading pallets and bales on and there is only one low loader for moving equipment.  Why would you remove such important trailers from the game? It makes no sense at all.

Im sure I will sink hundreds of hours into this game eventually but for now im done playing it until the modders make it enjoyable.  Then i can get my 50 bucks worth",1542868365,1542868365,False,11,0,0.549549520015716553,0,True,False,False,76561198113844416,73,1,7176,0,399,1598508028,,

11,46146931,english,"A definite mix of emotions here for this game. I really wanna love it, but it's got some quirks to it that I am just not satisfied for the cost.

Let me tell you some things I love about it:
~Graphics: This is the best graphical improvement to the series that I am super happy they made! Everything looks beautiful, from the lighting to the grass and the clouds! Textures are fantastic to look at, the distance location has improved compared to previous titles, and everything looks super realistic! Amazing job!

~Some of the new GUI tweaks compared to FS17 are definitely helpful. For people who like to play without that large help box at the top corner of the screen, it's nice to know when you are close enough to hook up to something with the nice indicator box at the bottom. They've also redone the way you use the Main Screens for scrolling through the map, stats, selling prices, etc., and I really enjoy it. I also like that you don't have to visit plots of land in order to take on missions, not that it was horrible in 17.

The things I dislike about this game:
~Bugs. Lots and lots of bugs. I run into a new bug every 15 minutes I play in this game. Missions don't always work, implements start freaking out and jump all over the place, and the AI are not all the smart (worse than FS17, to be honest.)

~Lack of content... This game feels a little empty compared to FS17. Like it should've had way more added onto it before it's release. People call this game just a DLC sized package, and part of me agrees with that. It's really sad that it's so empty.

~The maps are a bit lackluster. It's cool that we get to create our own farms and place things anywhere we feel on the map. But it's difficult to do so with how poorly the map designs feel. Finding a suitable spot for even just the small easy shed was a pain on the Ravenport map, only because I didn't want to choose the default location Giants have provided.

It looks like a re-release of Farming Simulator 17. I get it, Farming isn't exactly a gripping, story filled adventure, but everthing I hated about Farming Simulator 17 has been carried through to this one.

Differences that I've spotted.
1: Graphics have been improved.
2: You have the option to build your farm from scratch. Premade farm is only available on what was once 'EASY' mode.
3: UI is very different, it's nice, but a lot still works the same which is good.
4: More Crops, can't really complain, but it's still early for me, I'm sure I'll find something to complain about.
5: You can buy placeable silage silos now....FINALLY. I had to use a map editor on FS17.
6: Horses.
7: The trains/trolleys don't just sit in one spot, they zoom around the map.
8: You can download the Estancia Lepacho map as a mod in-game, it was the map included in FS17 Platinum Edition.
9: Animal animations are a lot better, they used to be quite jumpy in FS17.

I really hope they fix the damn shadow draw distance, it's incredibly short. I genuinely hate seeing shadows appear out of nowhere when I'm driving, especially with the train.

Giants should not rely on modders to do there job for them.

There are a large amount of mods from FS17 like real clock, helper admin, compass, follow me, unit convert, gps, etc that should be added to the basic game.

35,46105389,english,"FS17 was such a good product, I was so excited to see FS19 coming up, preordered the second it became available.  I am so irritated now that I’m pretty sure I won’t play again until it’s fixed.  The farm placement is absolutely terrible for anyone who cares about functionality and aesthetics.  The tractors all drive funny, edge of map graphics are jittery and fuzzy.  The maps themselves are very busy (lots of decorative bits), but lacks functionality.  Narrow windy roads are a pain to navigate, and lots of other stuff gets in the way.

The dog is stupid, and should have never been put in.  And good luck with horses and such due to the inmense cost of placing the buildings (after penalties for lowering or raising ground).  The farmhouse alone will cost you 350k, so even with starting as farm manager with 1.25mil in the bank, you’ll spend half of it just on some basic buildings.  Plus you’re not able to place roads, so even if you find nice spots for your buildings, they won’t fit right, there’ll likely be a small 50% grade going up to it, and no roads to connect them.

I was super excited for the new Challenger tractor, but the sounds are off, and the horn uses the basic “beep” one that the little tractors use.  Even the new Ideal combines have weak horns compared to the old style air horns (I know it’s silly, but it still is irritating).

Until the modders make better maps with pre placed buildings, I won’t even try the game again.  It’s absurd that after 2 years to make this game, they’ve basically reskinned FS17 with some features that don’t even work.  Shame on them for not coming up with a better product.  We all should have known better when no reviews were out before game release.  Hopefully they use all of our preorder money to fix these problems.

All in all a great simulator. I played FS17 and when I got into this I felt my money was well spent, but I play alot of simulators so if you dont play alot of simulators, buy FS17 because of the mods, as the mods for this are few. give it a month or two and this game is going to be 50 times better when the best mods gets ported over.

the game it wery buggy grapic are flickering the trees are the same as in fs17 same model same glitches
foresty equipment havent changed one bit from fs17 the clavs are worthless and cant hold on to anything the log claw for the front loader is as bad as allways the chip machine stil dosent allway grab the logs forcing you to jump up and cutting it up 
in to smaller so you can lift it

place able buildings:
deco object - silos - farm house rotate as they should
pastures dont they only have 4 angles making it imposible to plase them so it looks good
i notice on ravenport all pastures whant to face the same direction as the biogas plant does
why i have no idea but wery annoing

the AI worker it wery dumb and destructeble crop are not regristret from them
so forget about using them to make good lines for fertilizer/pestesides
they dont allway aling them self with the field at the beginning of a task
witch makes them worse than fs17

for eksample hire a worker to fertilize when he gets to the end off the field he will back backward on to the field again to turn back up to the edge and continue his job

single player: 
dont buy it stay with fs17 or atleast wait a couple of patch

multiplayer:
GIANTS have done this part wery well 
did not play that much mp in fs17 but in fs19
the systen is easy to use easy to config ho is allowed to do what
not to mention the team system i love it

even thoug i love farming simulator i cannot recommend this game as it at the moment
i even vonder why they did not wait with the release

I like the game.  It's not all working correctly yet, and that's a problem in and of itself.  The game shouldn't have released in such a state.  Even a cursory playthough should have found these issues weeks ago.  Giants obviouly had to know bout most of the problems, but maybe they thought they'd have a more effective Day-1 patch and things took longer than intended?  I should speculate.

I can't fault anyone that's dissatisfied but I think there's still a lot to like, also.  I didn't expect a massive departure from '17 and I think some did.  It's not.  It's not strickly iterative IMO, but it's not a departure from the formula that made past games enjoyable and successful.

89,46039411,english,"I only have a handful of hours into the game yet, but as someone who enjoyed a casual play of FS17, I have to say I thoroughly enjoy it.

I will absolutely admit that it has bugs right now, but have faith that the developer will be on top of them within a few patches.

I think the biggest gripe people have is that the seasons mod hasn't been integrated into the base game, and I feel like yes, this is an oversight, especially after hiring the modder who created said mod, reportedly.
I absolutely understand that the seasons gameplay, while fantastic in the eyes of many people, is the opposite in the eyes of many others. But the fact that the mod exists proves that it could always be integrated as an optional game mode.
But who knows, maybe it has been Giants' plan all along to include it as a free, official mod later down the road, I will keep my eyes on it.

Now to discuss the other gripe many people had: The lack of feature additions. Personally I don't feel this as strongly. Seasons aside, the game is very robust in my eyes, and seems to appeal to a certain target demographic, semi casual players to more involved gamers, however it does lack if you want to go into the true, x-plane 11 style simulation realism. It won't provide you with that level of involvement. And yes, I would love some more options, like being able to unload bigbags only if you move them into position above a seeder etc, or other such things. I hope that we will get such things eventually.

I can't really fault Giants for doing incremental increases, they seem to want to innovate carefully, use some mods and their community as guideline for what everyone seems to like, and take slow steps. For some, this is too slow, for me, personally, it feels right.

And of course, there is the large amount of things that DID make it into the game, a little list here.
* New crops, cotton and oats, as well as the FS17 DLC crop sugarcane (DLC features in sequel base game? Im looking at you, Sims)
* New horses with unique mechanics, feed them oats, ride them to train them and sell them at a profit later on
* Chickens are like pigs/cows now, buy, multiply them, feed them rather than them being decoration
* Milk needs transporting now
* Weeds are a full field action now rather than weeders counting as fertilizer stage
* New graphics engine that allows for some really beautiful shots
* New, cleaner, and imho much more useable UI

There is more, and what impressed me the most personally, is all the tiny little details, such as animated PTOs and vehicle interiors, proper tire collision models, a weightier feel to everything, better sound design, lovely 3d clouds. Alone they don't sound like much, but to me, they alter the feel of the game. FS19 feels more alive, feels more like you are handling big machinery than FS17, the world feels more expansive and more atmospheric.

Granted many feel different, as  is evident by the review score. But looking at the huge amounts of work that went into making this game, and the passion the developers have for it, as well as my personal experience with it, it certainly does NOT deserve the 60% it sits at right now. Personally I would rank it easily at 80% or above.

Mind you, this is my personal opinion~",1542835986,1542835986,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561197970332533,392,7,5210,0,963,1571958343,,

This time next year it'll be an awesome game. But the stock maps can take a running jump - embarrasingly bad.

I've thumbed up because without this base game the modded masterpiece wouldn't be possible. But if this is your first brush with FS then please, please don't judge it on the maps that come with the game - they SUCK and are not in any way representable of what it'll be like in a couple of months time. Yeah, a couple months. At least. The modding community of FS is awsome but it takes them so very much hard work and time to make a decent game out of this. 

Also a note to the wise - if you are a graphics addict then I'd beware of this game. It takes a beast of a PC to make it look as good as it can - and even then draw distances suck.

The new european map is fantastic, lots of fun to be had. Forestry is actually challenging now, having to actually own the land where you cut down the trees. This also means that you'll have to invest in log-transportation unlike in FS17 where you could just cut down the trees closest to the sawmill. 

Looking forward to what 2 more years might give us, here's hoping for terrain deformation with excavators and mud physics like in Spintires.

Is this game perfect? by no means. But in videogames, issues pop up. Most of which I'm sure will be dealt with in a timely manner, as people report them. I personally feel like there was an improvment to the engine (Because it IS a new engine, they've said as much...it's kind of a big deal to them).

The custom charactor is a nice change of pace, though not super important...because you aren't looking at your own face. The focus of the game is Farming...this isn't ""Country Fashion Barbie"". Not sure why people are complaining about that.

I have graphics maxed out on my slightly above average rig and the game looks gorgeous. no FPS drops, reflective surfaces are great, the sun shining through the trees is beautiful. the dog looks dumb. a Little more effort in the dog, please. You cant be a proper farmer without a loyal dog.

The field destruction is really cool, having Narrow wheels changes how you determine which tractor to use. Ability to turn all that off is there. the worker function never really worked great, but it is a bit better. Mods will eventually come out to fix all that. Giants has always been really good about supporting that community.

Cons? Vehicle controls are CLUNKY as a drunk nun. Cruise control is your friend here. The mod screen is just as much a pain in the ass as before. Navigating it really needs a serious overhaul. The inability to delete redundant buildings to make room is non-exsistant. So that annoying shed thats sittinf where your chicken coop needs to go (because waterfalls make happy chickens)?

13,45998487,english,"This game is tranquil and relaxing simulator game that you can sink countless hours into. This game is perfect for playing while watching videos/streams on your other monitor. Listening to music/podcasts also works. Personally speaking this is a necessity because otherwise the game would get very dull purely on its own. But that's just my subjective opinion. 

Some of the negative reviews here have fair points but a lot of them seem a little dramatic. This game is not identical to FS17 and offers several welcome improvements. But the number of improvements isn't massive either. It is up to the individual to decide whether it's worth the asking price or not. And considering the game is priced at 35€ I feel like it's a fair price. I will list several pros and cons to help you decide if it's worth buying or not. 

Pros: 
[list]
    [*]Graphics are vastly improved in comparison to FS17. Vehicles and implements are very detailed, lighting is much better, field textures are nicer to look at, colors are more vibrant etc. 
    [*]You can now see field information by going to the field itself instead of having to open the map to see if it needs to be fertilized, plowed etc
    [*]Weeds and lime are a welcome addition for field preparation. Gives a good reason to own more tractors to get these additional jobs done. 
    [*]Parts of previous DLC from FS17 are implemented in the base game of FS19. Stuff like a baler-wrapper, sugarcane crop etc. 
    [*]The mod support is really good. The collector's edition even comes with modding video tutorials on a disc. There is a mods section on the game's official site where there are currently a few mods uploaded by the developer. There's even a previous FS17 DLC map completely free. User made mods are on the way. The savegame is also easy to edit in notepad to give yourself more money if you want to do so.
    [*]The shop now has a fully 3D model displayed so you can see exactly what different options look like. Previously you had no idea of knowing how big a difference there was between normal and wide tires for example before buying the item. Or how a tractor would look with a certain color on it etc. 
    [*]Menus are cleaned up and look nicer. You no longer have dark boxes to display information, everything is transparent this time around. All the relevant info is displayed in a compact and easy to read way. 
    [*]You can now save the game and come back later when doing jobs for other farmers. Previously you were pretty much instanced and if you had a big field you'd have to play nonstop for hours or you would lose all progress unless you left the game running overnight or something. 
    [*]At least some tractors have specific engine sounds recorded from their real life counterparts
    [*]The AI is at least slightly improved. Previously they couldn't do triangle-shaped fields well at all, stopping at each end. This time around they are able to go through and continue perfectly. 
    [*]You can now empty implements like fertilizer sprayers if you need to switch from liquid fertilizer to herbicide. Pressing I will create a tank of herbicide or liquid fertilizer on the ground next to you.
[/list]

Cons/mixed and subjective stuff:
[list]
    [*]The nights could be darker. Currently it's very easy to see at night and it's a little weird. 
    [*]Distant mountains look really bad. When looking at a plowed field sideways it shimmers a bit and just looks bad. There are other graphical hiccups also, but nothing terrible. 
    [*]Mouse feels terrible in this game. Sensitivity is extremely low and it just feels very jerky. V-sync on or off doesn't make a difference at all. In a vehicle it's fine and when controlling front loaders and such but when walking around it's horrible. I've found this game to be best played with a controller and keyboard combo. 
    [*]Wheel support is bad. The game shows correct inputs for my G29 and it does pick up the pedals etc. Problem is that you can't control the force feedback in game so the wheel is extremely stiff. There is a workaround that worked for FS17 but doesn't seem to be working currently in this title. 
    [*]Economy and prices are all over the place. 350,000€ for a house? Why?? Things like cow pastures etc.  are also way too expensive. In addition to that you seem to get a bit less money for your crops in the normal difficulty compared to FS17. The contracts (jobs for other farmers) also have really pathetic payouts. I recommend playing on the ""easy"" difficulty to get reasonable money for your crops. 
    [*]Create your own farm system is lackluster. It's just a bunch of placeable items on the map and that is it. No ability to make roads or change surface type etc. The terraforming the game uses to level out the ground to make items fit is also stupidly expensive. 
    [*]Physics are wonky. Stacking bales and lifting pallets just feels floaty. It works, but only just. 
    [*]Somewhat of a steep learning curve for a beginner. I went into FS17 without knowing a thing about farming. The game has basic tutorials and it'll get you started. But it can get confusing quickly when you start getting into baling, silage, total mixed ration for cows etc. I wouldn't worry about it too much, you don't have to do everything. There's no requirement to own animals and no requirement to do specialized crops like sugarcane or root crops. Just do whatever you personally want to.

21,45989551,english,"Although I've played every FS game since 15, I wouldn't count myself an in depth expert on them. I don't know, for example, how accurate the simulation of this equipment is.

I will say that the gameplay and interface feel far clunkier than they should at this point in the series. For example, the default mouse sensitivity is so low that I have to move my mouse across my desk several times to turn my head around in game. I can't see why anyone would want to have the sensitivity set that low at all, let alone have it as the default. On 400% of the normal sensitivity it's still sluggish compared what I'd consider to be normal. Of course, I'd prefer not to be using the mouse at all, but for whatever reason the game refuses to let me actually use my gamepad. 

There's just this overwhelming sense that all of the design effort went into the equipment and little else. Whether it's the ""character designer"" that lets you chose from only the tiniest number of customization options, or the soundscape which plays the same generic countryside background noise loop at the same volume whether your in your fields, in your house, or in town, the world of the game feels like a lot of placeholder content. I'm constantly bothered by the repetitive footstep sounds that feel like they're from the early 2000s.

That said, the graphics are a notable step forward, and the core gameplay is still a lot of fun. I definitely love that you can have a dog now. Depending on how much later patches polish this game, my recommendation will likely change, but right now it's just a bit too rough around the edges for me to recommend you jump in.

43,45968190,english,"I have played over a thousand hours on FS15 and FS17, so I think that gives me the ability write an informed review after only one day with FS19.
Good points:
1. The crop care simulation is more realistic. The game now includes herbicides and lime. And the use of weeders and plowing have been improved so that they are actually valuable tools.
2. The graphics are definitely better. Graphics are always a trade off between realism, playability and hardware demand. I think FS19 strikes a great balance between these factors. The graphics are attractive, immersive, and appropriate for the gameplay.  I use a mid level gaming laptop, and the game runs smooth as silk.
3. You can now choose starting conditions where you don't own a farm, and then build (mostly) from scratch. This is a huge leap forward in customization and replayability.
4. The savegame files are easy to modify with a word processor. I won't explain how to do this here, but it makes it very easy to design any starting scenario you want.
5. The types of livestock have been increased with new care options.
6. The number of farm machines is just amazing. You could play for hundreds of hours just trying new machines and farming techniques.

Bad points:
1. It took me over 30minutes to set up my game pad. I had the same hassles setting up FS15 and FS17. And reading the discussions pages I see I'm not the only one with this frustration.  Giant really needs to invest some work in making their set up system better.
2. The starting options are limited. There are only three scenarios: easy start with a working farm, medium with cash and no farm, hard with less cash and no farm. There are work arounds for creating your own scenario by modding the savegame files, but I think Giants should make some of these options visible at game startup. Maybe have some theme farms like a dairy, or horse ranch, or logging camp. 
3. The lack of startup options means you have to grind, grind, grind to get to the point where you can specialize in things like raising livestock, or buying and using those expensive  pieces of equipment. 

Neutral:
1. The game ships with two new maps that are very similar, and one old map in the mod folder. Lots of great old maps from early FS games are missing. The included maps should give you many hours of gameplay, and hopefully the mod community will add more content.
2. There are a limited number of placeble objects for designing your own farm, and many of them are not interactive. For example, there is only one farmhouse design available for each map. Why could they not put all three farmhouses from all three maps in all three placeble folders? Also the moneymaking placeables like bee hives, greenhouses and windmills are missing. I think Giant is waiting for the mod community to do their work for them.

 Overall I think FS19 is a great update to the farming simulator line.  It's not a stunning change in the game, but it is a very nice evolutionary improvement. It makes the game feel fresh again, with better graphics and new gameplay.",1542827831,1542827831,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198069403081,161,9,13364,0,1593,1599480369,,

Update:

It is possible to outmaneuver the bug. Apparently it only occurs when a player joins your server while you are in any kind of menu. It's still not possible to call your farm
Ally's and Elly's Farm
because the game makes it
Ally's and $&ly's Farm
for some reason, but thats a minor (yet funny) bug.
Another bug (I hope its a bug) worth mentioning is the TERRIBLE walking animation that honestly gives me the creeps and looks very ridiculous (at least for female models)

I like the new plot system when buying a field, it felt more realistic giving you freedom to do as you wish with the land you own.

Cons:
Buggy, encountered lot of minor issues. dogs pathing poorly (it also looks terrible). When ploughing/ferilising my fields I found large patches in all my fields that simply would not accept the products unless i ran the equpiment at 90 degrees to my chosen path.

Equipment is actually kinda limited, depsite being hundreds of different units, such as the only flatbed trailer is the first trailer avilable and you simply configure into a flatbed.  You also have clones of stuff such as the fendt/challanger tractor. Why?

The streering is bad and takes far too long to set up to be comfortable to use

Building placement it clunky and while you can remove the buildings it does not remove the altered ground or floor texture.

The horses are just bad.

Final thoughts:
I think it has promise, it just feels like it has been rushed and released far too early. I think the modding comunity will love the game too but it shouldnt come down, once again to the community to fix the game and add the basic content and variance that the base game should have. I'd give it 6 months before buying it for bug fixes and decent mod content to come out before buying it.

89,45929285,english,"Ok, I do not write reviews but seeing that many people trying to protect this piece of garbage is making me do otherwise.
Please accept the following rows from someone who is in love with the series since Farming Simulator 2009.
(For the impatient, read the last two rows, that sums up the whole thing:P)

First of all, graphics. Yeah, same old story, I know, the haters are whining that the graphics are ugly. Because IT IS, for God's sake! And don't bring that sorry ass excuse like I read here (those are the players who ruin the game industry by the way) that get a better video card and so on. Mine is 1080, so - and correct me if I am wrong - I don't think that I have to upgrade for FS19. :P
Back to the story, the main problem is that the devs PROMISED a new look, better everything, visually stunning experience. Half the damage has been taken if they were not to do so. If they were said that, we don't upgrade nothing, a bit of polishing here and there, but using the EXACT SAME THING AS IN FS17, it would prevented much, much negative reviews.
The graphics are utter garbage. Period. Still the awful 2D field textures, tree models are the same, they managed to even degrade the map itself! Look at the borders of it, disgusting blurry textures like in 1999. How can this could be passed QA testing...?! And if all of these is not enough, flowers and bushes creep inside the vehicles interior view...?! How can someone fuck up an already implemented graphical engine to this degree? What was the development idea, take the engine from FS17, 15, 13, etc. and ruin it...? :D Enough of graphics, all in all, its horrible.

Moving to the actual gameplay itself. And I swear, this is the worst part. It is a tragicomedy. Same story applies as with graphics, take something that is already tested and working (to a certain level I should say, but we are already used to the bugs of the FS series) and just simply ruin it. 
In FS19's current state there are better games, developed by indie teams, still in EARLY ALPHA, that are far better than this piece of shit. Even the fucking tutorial is bugy for new players!:D You can't finish wood cutting because the chainsaw script doesn't trigger at all...!:D Again, QA testing!!! Not to mention that the chainsaw's texture is clipping through the wood, the part ""inside"" the wood is invisible, the rest of it is growing out from the other side of the tree... And you don't have a hand! In nearly 2019, how the actual fuck a game could be released, which employes hand tool mechanism, without the hands themselves...?! I saw a guy in a video who hit a civilian car with one of the biggest Deutz-Fahr tractor resulted in that the tractor turned to its side and was spinnig around itself. I've read here that someone could climb to a tree mounted on the new horse feature, which the devs hyped. For me the shop and ATM markers were didn't worked, only from the hotkey. Positioning placeables are still a nightmare, the controls are clunky, the rotation is slow and still does not have any fine-grained functionality. 
Just an example, if you want to place something somewhere else than where you standing, well, grab a brick, put it on the actual arrow where you have to move and go grab a dinner, a bath, a movie... or a drive from Munich to Barcelona because that is how fast the camera moves ingame while the placeable menu is active.
Seasons. Yeah, I know. I am one of those cursed haters again. How can it be, that something which agriculture revolves around since its very existence is still not implemented in a FARMING GAME? To not even go further, Forza Horizon 4 has seasons! A a few DLCs to there and you'll be properly farming earlier with a McLaren Senna than in a Goddamn farming game...!
Player movement. Still the ""floating in one of the four directions in the air"" effect. Instead of the worthless character creation, they've should changed this.
Vehicle interiors. What is the point in polishing this whole thing if the panels inside the machines still 90% not working. There are pro modders (and we are extremely grateful for them throughout the whole FS series up until this point!) who made fully functional, working, interactive interiors by themselves and a whole dev team cannot. Unacceptable!
Did you folks seen the exhaust effects of the vehicles? I just don't want to go in it. It is enough that ""Beautiful graphics"" and the effect was ok, back in FS2013.
And this list is so endless, that we can sit here all night long. These were the most painful ones, at least for me.

Lets get down to the last category of my novel, physics. I promise it will be short. Worth nothing. End of story. Basically still not exists, a minor tweaking here and there, but nothing useful.

So, I think I owe some last thoughts for those of you who made it this far. Still, all of the above is from someone who had countless hours and love in the FS series, but FS19 is something that shouldn't be happened, at least not in its current form.
It is a shame that this thing is a full release, it should be nothing more than 9.99 EUR/USD DLC for FS17.

90,45929260,english,"So I have put hundreds of hours in the past two Farm Sims and I have already put a good amount of time in FS 19.

Pros:
-The graphics overhaul has made this game much more enjoyable and just stunning to experience. It may not seem like a massive improvement, but it is a big step in the right direction. 
-Just the overall user controls have improved a great deal in my opinion. Most of them are small improvements that may seem insignificant, but taking away key strokes that were in previous games very pleasent. 
-The sheer amount of vehicle and equiptment variety has been amazing, and obviously with the addition to John Deere the wait for mods will be much less painful in my opinion. 
-The process of customizing your vehicles and equipment is amazing now that you can preview what you will actully be getting as well as the brand-named paints
-The new logic behind when fields need plowed is really nice because it reflects that of real agriculture. Now if only you could no-til certain crops as well.

Cons:
-Surprisingly there have been quite a few small bugs in the game on release that have made it frustrating at times. 
-Equipment that have been detatched will often roll endlessly until you stop them and they even tend to hit one thing and continue in a different direction despite the fact there are bright yellow chocks around the wheels.
-I found a problem with a round bale fork that fold and it is unusable currently.
-I have not gotten into livestock yet, but from my observation the price of the livestock enclosures is at least double of a reasonable price, and I am not sure how I feel about the manual milk sale currently.
-This might be just me, but the rate at which weeds appear seems to be too often. Sometimes I have to weed/spray the same crop twice before harvest
-The problem with starting contracting jobs persists and basically makes them disappear when you try to accept them in some cases.

> New Stuff like horses and cotton in base game without mods or dlc 
> It feel like ground , terran and wight have a bigger impact so you have to watch out what machine you use 
> Start from scratch build your own Farm where ever you want  Irealy love that a lot ( is there a way to creat paths or foundation at the moment my farm is build on a lot of grass )
> sound massivly Improved 
> Rain Bug is mostly fixed
> Multiplayer  Multiply Farms 


The bad 

 >issues with conection even with fiber conection and just 2 player there is like 1/2 up to 3 sec delay from time to time
 >Placing objects  on hill is a bit tricky 
> usfull equitment from FS 17 removed tracktor trailer and more 

The Ugly

1,45928074,english,"This will eventually be a great game, however, its unfinished, ill-thought out and it is so riddled with major, game breaking bugs that it is a bit of an insult to hard core FS fans like myself. I have never had anything bad to say about the previous games as I was happy to work arround or ignor things that i wasn't happy with but now we are 6 versions in and the original peeves are still there. What we have here is more of the same. Badly executed new features and very few improvements to the original features that everyone in the FS community has been harping on about for years.

If you are a tottaly new player then im sure it will be a good game in its current form once the bugs are fixed but if you have been playing fs since 2009 you will be utterly disapointed.

From what i can see, in its current form, its not a good enough change in any way shape or form to warrent buying now, over, continuing to play fs17 with all of the available mods. Had i known how bad this was going to be i would have waited 6 - 12 months for the modders to sort it out so it is at least on par with fs17 when i started with it.

I had expected a step back in terms of content while the modding community do their thing, however i did expect the basics to be included and that the new features would keep me somewhat entertained while I wait but they really don't work so thats that out the window.

Positives: 
- Graphics are better
 - It has some neat features such as bending crops. 
- Textures look more in depth
- vehicle physics have improved. You can almost sense the weight in the machine and the suspension looks fab!
- contracts feature is a nice addition and is far better than the old missions system in previous versions.
- machine modeling is to a fantastic standard
- menus and HUD have a much better, more modern aperance and they are less intrusive.
- customisable equipment is in the game and the preview feature is good as you can see what you are getting.
- you can empty product from the machines back into storage. i.e. seed, fert, etc

Now for the bad stuff:

Placeables system is a joke. tottaly useless, frustrating and lacking in items to build with. The terreforming is so so bad its just not worth the agrovation. Mappers have failed to put in areas for you to build on, theres no placable textures to build on, no roads to join up your farm to the map roads, you can only buy and place one house. This is by far the worst execution of what could have been a great addition to the game. Its totaly not fit for purpose!

setting up controllers  is a nightmare, if you can acctually get them to work that is. We were told that we were getting full logitech support for wheels, game pads, joysticks etc. To me, that meant plug and play. I spent hours trying to get the controls to work. They randolmy worked for no reason after 3 hours of messing about with the mapping. Vehicles stuck in reverse, cranes ignoring the mapped buttons, flickering of icons, no support in the logitech gaming software as FS19 does not appear when scanning for games. Mine only started working when i went into fs17 then into fs19, At first my tractor was stuck flat out in reverse. It drove up and over the fence, crashed into a tree and suddenly started working.  

The engine noises sound wierd and the volume levels for the tools are louder than the engines.

The maps are nice to look at on the surfacet, but really boring and inconsistant to play on. Its like the map on GTA 5. we have a bit of everything. Mountains, coastline, beaches, hilly land, flat land... Great in gta  but not very realistic in farming sim over such a small area. Fields have a token jesture of irregular shapes but we still have 90 degree corners, no fences, hedges or anything to break up the fields. There are fields just plonked onto the landscape, some require driving over ridiculous terrain to get to them as there are no tracks to drive down to get to the field. 

The other new features such as horses and dogs. Great to have, but, they have spent time working on useless stuff like this rather than improving on what we had in the last versions of the game. Why have we not seen new equipment and textures for root crop farming for example. These crops require more equipment, more processes and a different way of farming to cereals.

 Why are we still missing GPS, Courseplay, follow me and a whole host of stuff that die hard fans of the game can't live without.

hired workers are just as useless as before

ai traffic is not any better

The choice of tools dont match the choice of tractors. i.e. ploughs. you get a 2.5 meter wide 3 point fixed plough or the next one up is a big trailed plough. So the fixed one could go on a small tractor and the next one up would need a big tractor. where's the option for medium tractors? Same with trailers. The only flat bed available is a tiny sigle axel trailer that a compact tractor would pull.

Contracts reward money seems to have no relationship to the task. Spraying a field which takes 5 mins pays £4500. Ploughing a field with a pathetically small plough which takes half the day to do yeilds £2500?

The forestry equipment is unusable due to control issues. The booms telescopic in and out on their own with other crane movements and the buttons mapped to control the telescopic booms, don't work. I went through the mapping countless times, doesn't work. Then i discover that the harvester wont slew when the cranes do??

Other bugs i found within miniutes of playing;
deadzone setting reset themselves to default
JD corn header gets stuck on the header trailer
you reset a vehicle, it takes all the fuel away
icons at the store dont work
the list goes on.

FS19 is awesome, new Game mode are cool to play ( i love the ""My farm mode"" - you start with 1250000 and you must start from scratch, you go on fields and chose a land to buy, then buy equipment, Buildings, silos etc..

The Graphics are awesome and More High quality then FS17 ( when you have the computer for it. If you are too poor to have a good ""gaming"" computer, don't whine graphic sucks, your computer suck )

What I like: seems that market a less affected when you dump a load of Crops. In FS17, 1 load of Soybean could be 1200$ and after 1  run the price plummet to 800$. In FS19, I did notice that after 1 load of soybean, price has started to go down but from 1200$ to 1160$. At least we have now time to go back to Silo, fill up and come back to sell stuff

For sure 45$ seems a bit high, but the modder society is so awesome that this game will be flooded by mods. And keeping a big number of mods to be downloaded, maintain, updated etc, that cost a lot of money for servers and bandwidth. So why not. It takes money to build a game and maintain a game.

I discovered Farming Simulator a few months ago, at that point FS19 was already announced, and FS17 had been out for a significant period of time. Both were the same cost so I decidided to do the not so pleasant thing and download FS17 ""for free"" to see if the game would even be worth it. After playing FS17 for a few hours I absolutely loved the game and decided to preorder FS19 because i figured there would be minor changes, but the gameplay would probably stay the same.

Now that my little backstory is done, why do I recommend FS19. Honestly because the game is very similar to 17, but with a few crucial added features, and while yes a good portion of those features were mods on FS17, that in itself is why I like Giants Software. They actually listen to their community, and actually support modding and custom creations. Through map contests, or equipment contests, and even tractor contests. The company loves when people mod the game, and that's why FS17 was amazing. I could download hundreds of mods, from small textures, to manufacturer packs that included everything from small cultivators to 600 Horsepower Harvestors from companies that the game did not have in it. And judging from this game the modding, and community improvement will only continue.

I like to see Farming Simulator as a foundation of farming games. It throws all of the mechanics, basic machinery, and general farming aspects of the game, and allows its consumers to bascially do whatever their hearts desire. If you already have FS17 I would wait for a sale, however if you are new to FS19 or just want the game early, i recommend it thourougly.

With a collective of 655 hours between FS15 and FS17 here is my opinion on FS19.

[b] Holy overhyped batman! [/b]

[*]I've been waiting for this to release for quite awhile now, counting down the days till I can ""Farm like never before."" While the slogan (like most) is completely vague, it is true. New crops, animals and John Deere implements are very welcome additions to the franchise and suffices the ""Farm like never before"" quota. 

[*]I didn't notice much of a graphical change, very FS17 (like a lot of other people are saying) like style and feel. I did like how the crops moved when you swung your sprayer boom into them, makes it a little more immersive.

[*]I do like the new store menu how everything is categorized and subcategorized so I'm not scrolling like crazy to the right looking through ALL tractors. The ESC menu is a little worse than FS17 and I really dislike how you almost have to hunt for the 'quit game' buttom (atleast I didn't discover an easier way than through the options menu.)

[*]My BIGGEST disappointment and the one thing that excited me the most about this game is the ""Start from Scratch"" mode. Maybe it's just the poor maps (more on that in a minute) but I was looking forward to starting my farm from a forest and having to chop down a bunch of trees and hollow out my farming area. They really limit you on where you can easily start your farm. I spent a good portion of my time just figuring out where I would start and how I would expand but both maps are VERY hilly. I would see a decent spot from the ESC map view and think ""oh that would work ok"" then run there and realized where I was going to put my buildings was on top of a steep hill with trees and a communications tower.

[*]I really like the land purchasing system where you purchase a plot of land instead of just a field. Makes it feel a little more like your land instead of your field. 

[*]Both maps feel very similar and aren't that great (in my style of play I suppose.) A couple clusters of small fields, lots of medium to large fields and both have a lot of hills which limit field expanding. A lot of the smaller fields I was trying to start my farm around were on inclines which made it nearly impossible for light to medium tractors to even drive up while harvesting potatoes or sugar beets. 

[*]The vehicle selection seems smaller than FS17 as well although the new purchase screen is AWESOME. I love being able to see the product from a 360 degree view and see the different options actually applied onto the product before I purchase it. I assume that the smallish product roster will be remedied with paid for DLC (miss early 2000s era of gaming where DLC was already in the game) but hopefully some free DLC? *dreamy eyed*

[*]I believe FS19 to be the worst one I've played of the three (FS15, FS17 and FS19) but it may have the best foundation to be patched into my favorite one once they polish it a little more and more mods get going (hopefully courseplay and more realism mods are sooner rather than later.)

[*]I think FS19 has the potential to be a solid addition to the franchise, but only with mod help and more maps. It was severely overhyped (in my opinion) and I was completely underwhelmed.

You're probably reading this on the fence about purchasing it and my questions to you are:

[b] Do you own FS17? [/b]
If so, pass on FS19 until on sale or patched into health.

[b] Do you like mods? [/b]
If so, wait a few weeks, maybe it'll be on sale by then.

[b] Are you looking to carve out your own farm from the wilderness like I was? [/b]
If so, pass on it until either GIANTS introduces better maps for it or (the more likely) some wonderful hero creates a good map for it.

[b] Would this be your first Farming Simulator game? [/b]
It may be worth the purchase. By the time you fully understand it and can comprehend more complex farming there will probably be some DLC or mods available.

Everything considered?

There is even an annoying flickering line across my screen that won't go away.

When people kept on complaining about starting off with equipment, they really went full childish mode to not give you anything at all but just starting cash. It's like going to a bar, and you kindly asked for more surgar in your drink, but the bar tender goes full pissed off mode, and poured the entire bag of sugar. You get no house, no land, nothing, just cash.

You have to use your own equipment now for contracts. The cash is not rewarding enough to make the contracts worth your while, since you're gonna be using the equipment on your own farms(which I hope).

No tooltips - Yes there is a tutorial but tooltips are very much the standard in today's gaming industry. With so many different map symbols, filters, vehicle types, etc. it would have made my initial experience much smoother. 

Convoluted menu interface - Esc, then Info, then Backspace to leave the game isn't very intuitive. That is the most prominent example. 

Recycle bins - 10 of my 52 minutes played were spent trying to get past recycle bins with my harvester. I had knocked some over with my tractor and they were in the middle of the road. I figured surely my harvester could push them out of the way! Not initially. I drove over them and was stuck, then was forced onto a mail box which seems to be constructed with adamantium. I dismounted my vehicle but the hand symbol doesn't do anything so I couldn't manually move them. I eventually deployed the harvester to shovel the bins off the road. 

I went from very, very excited to not at all. The game looks just fantastic from the intro video but it's not a smooth transition to actually getting into the game. I'm certain in the long run it will be a lot of fun but for now, the UI and basic movement / interaction still needs work.

Ok... as beeing a player, and modder since FS2013.... here we go...

Fs 19 looks good, feels right, ...meh....ok pherhaps, not always,all of you  oldtimers ...I think you know the feeling...
The things that really disturbes me are these, and I'll give you a quick summary.
controls.... and this is a major one...:
Since 2013 Drive Control has been developed by one of the top modders. Followed by Gearbox, also a great feature... 
All giants needed to do is convert the scripts and add them as an option... Who wants to put his foot on his brake to go backwards. I dont...
Controls combinations...:  no longer working in FS19 ; now I know in the xml file you can combine keystrokes on your input device, using notepad++ but you have to know how that works... However in FS 17 it was simple as hold a button and push another one to get a different input from 2 keys hold together,  maybe not so important , but still it was easy to copy paste  for them to implement it since its the same engine obviously.
 So thats in the bin...

Next big dissapointment;

Placeables.... oh my.... what have we got there...10isch  non functional buildings.... 3 ""THREE"" sheds, some silos.... a hayloft and a doghouse... and some other stuff, mostly converted from 17.

It irritates me so much that Giants is just releasing something they are been building on from a decade ago. While doing a great job on that , gfx wise and all the other enhancements, they seem to just rely on the modding community to make it as it should be.
Modders again have to recreate their mods since 2013... the only inclussion of a mod I see right now is chopped straw, and crop destruction. Nice ; Thumbs up really!!. love it!!
No moving doors, no ""usefull builidings, nothing to interact with..."" and to make mathers worse, a real pain in the neck , placeable system to ""create your farm of your dreams"". The terraforming is a complete dissaster....

Foilage: to sketchy.... Long unatural grass, feels unrealistic . Bushes still comming through the bottom of your vehicle. Rain sitll pours on you dashboard...Really?

I have been a player , modder and spended 2000+ hours since 2013  probably more included the modding... but very dissapointed...
Thats all there is to it really.
I really hope that FS19 will be as great as its predecessors, just by the input of the modding community. Because of now I lost my trust in Giants. They really do not up their game enough. Just my 2 thoughts, and would share this with you.

[i]Farming Simulator 19[/i] offers a good bit of fun and content - but it still suffers from some fundamental design problems that are painful to see still persisting in the latest edition. These issues could certainly be overlooked a decade ago, but now after six or so versions of the game - a lot of it becomes unexcusable. For instance, how can any self-proclaimed farming simulator not have seasons this far into the franchise? Seasons are so critical to farming that I can't begin to understand why they are not in the base game at this point. Also, the core mechanic is interacting with fields, so why don't we have a more dynamic tire and soil interaction? This is basic stuff. I could go on. This simulator still largely boils down to 'painting' fields.

[b]While some will have you think [i]Giants Software[/i] has the market cornered - mark my words - all it will take is a small indie team with a few bucks and an open mind to topple this series.[/b] It's not that difficult of a game to get right, and it's only a matter of time. Let me explain why I say this. For those that aren't familiar with the community, what you need to know is that it has a strong [i]'old guard'[/i] attitude. While the community is mostly nice, long standing members (including the developers) are largely unwilling to accept or consider new ideas. This is the core problem. This series may be the best you can get right now in the farming simulation genre, but it leaves a lot to be desired (compared to, say, [i]American Truck Simulator[/i] which feels darned near perfect for that genre). 

[b]Pros:[/b]
+It's a remarkably fun time sink.
+There is a lot of content, and mods are icing on the cake.
+The multiplayer aspect adds a lot.
+For the most part, it's all quite beautiful.

[b]Meh:[/b]
=I'm the last person to talk about graphics, but these are a bit of a letdown. It still feels a bit dated or something (particularly the 2D soil).
=The character creator is sort of a tease. Yes, thank you for adding it in, but it is the absolute bare-minimum it could be. What would it take to simply expand on it?
=The world feels more alive (finally), but still could use more in this department.

[b]Cons:[/b]
-The series as a whole needs to evolve at a much faster rate.
-There are details in the game that really need to be explained. I had this complaint about other installments in this series, and it still persists here. Yes, there is a good bit explained in some areas, and yet none in others. This should have been brought up with early playtesters who are fairly new to the series or farming in general.
-No seasons in the base game.
-No Steam Workshop support, and on a long enough timeline you will want mods. Many want them day one. I may be fine with no Steam Workshop if I found [i]Giants Software[/i] mod website to be fanastic, but unfortunately I don't.
-Mouse sensitivity is horribly low even at the maximum of 200%. Who could playtest this for more than 20 minutes and not realize this?
-Why does the American map look so trashy? This is a big complaint from me, because it was clearly a deliberate design choice. Sure, I've witnessed American farmland that looks like this - but I've also seen plenty of much less rundown farmland in America. Why not make it a bit more pleasant. Very curious design that I almost take offense to.
-For being a 'simulator', there actually isn't all that much content that reflects this. For example, you can 'tab' teleport between vehicles, break signs in the town with impunity (how about a small monetary fine?), and 'paint' fields haphazardly with no penalty, among other things.

79,45920060,english,"Well...all I can comment on is my personal experience. After around 10 hours play on the new American map starting with the basic farm - no lag and no bugs (that I noticed).

I like the new purchase system where you can see the changes you make before buying.

The new (to me) cotton baler was pretty neat.

The fields purchasing is a little different...I think I preferred seeing the icons on the fields htough...I like the 'For Sale' boards that some modders used for their maps in FS17.

The missions system...is a lot more time consuming to start the mission. You either have to use your own equipment, which means driving it from your field to the mission field, or lease equipment, which means having to drive it from the shop to the mission field. The helper ability to assist in missions is good though.

I've only tried one map so far - the 'American' one I guess...I can't say I'm impressed. It doesn't seem like a lot of thought has gone into the layout and the 'real' way that businesses with heavy vehicle traffic would be accessed, but maybe that's just my impression.

As with so many games these days it's the mods that will truly make this game. The bare bones are there, but the modders truly make things shine (as with FS17).

It's nice to have an included compass too :-)

I'd recommend it for those looking to idle a few hours away in a casual way. If you're looking for gritty, season-based reality farming, then wait for the Seasons mod I guess.

- Placables now create levelled ground where they're placed and add a new texture (asphalt, concrete etc) around the placement. That's all fine and good, but there's no option to place a placable without the texture. Also, the texture remains there after you remove the placable and you can't get rid of it with the roller. 

- No ground modification tool in base game, which would be the greatest asset when creating your own farm. It seems like this feature would be easy to implement with the system mentioned above changing ground textures. 

- Joystick binding seems to be very buggy at this point in time. Some axes are not registering and in the menus it seems to not be able to decide whether you're using kb/m or stick and flashes between controls. (May just be my joystick however.)

I played for a little over 5 hours last night and i can't say i had many issues via the graphics or freezing or whatever. Two, people are complaining about how you have to start out with little money and actually buy all the land.....OMG NO WAY WHAT? Who woulda thought in a simulator youd actually have to buy anything, good god people wine a lot.

By now most of the haters and winers have stopped reading this review so now its just for all those people that actually want to know how the game is..


So whats good about this?

- Graphics, the graphics in this game is the biggest aspect of this FS. They have improved expontentially from the texture quality to the shaders everything. Yes this means you need a little better system to run at full settings and expereince it. 

- Vehicles, there are loads of vehicles to choose from, many different brands, different types of vehicles and so much more. As well as the handling seems so much more real, it takes time to accelerate and deaccelerate. When you turn the wheel it doesnt jolt right back to forward when you let go. It all seems much more real.

- Store, i think the store UI is so much better, you can actually see a 3D preview of the tractor or equipment before you buy it, as well as you can actually see the modifcations you make to it so your not just guessing what it looks like. When you can see what a double wheel setup looks like or thin wheels, it makes assurance that what your looking at is what your getting.

- Farming Mechanics, the way they have changed the way you farm is very interesting indeed. When you are in first person your tractor actually bumps up and down, your seat moves with the bumps it all seems more real. When you harvest and the chaff is flowing out the back it changes the tint of the ground becasue of the dust. Birds come and eat at your seed after you sow, it all seems so real.


Whats not so good?

Maps, currently only 2 default maps in the game and they arent that good for being able to make a farm as there isnt really any good space to start an area, or forestry for that matter, but mods will definetly help this. 

Ground Modifications, i find it crazy after this long you still can change what the ground is like you cant change from grass to pavement or gravel. It makes making a farm pretty hard as you need to make a road yourself with a plow and cultivating which works but not the most opurtune.

All in all the game IS a improvement in the last in many ways, those who say its the same game probably don't have the computer power to run at high settings and are just winy and picking at every little thing (keep in mind most of these negative reviews have played for less than an hour and havent even experienced the game). The game will only get better as mods come out and you can change the game a little more. I don't see myself ever going back to 17 as the graphics and gameplay in 19 are far superior. 

I highly reccomend the game and it is an improvement and will be playing for hours and hours.

I understand they have improved some of the lighting to the game so it 'looks' nicer, however a lot of the graphics are still very poor, textures having a view distance of about 100m and even if you turn up the distance the game is so badly optimzed it just lags like mad. This is one small problem with the graphical 'improvements' I've found in the huge list I could write under this catergory considdering Giants seemes to have made this there main focus for FS19..

 Being a tractor driver as an occupation, there are so many things in farming 'simulator' which just arent particularly realistic, lack of development to the main mecahnics of the game are the biggest let-down for FS2019, seeing something as basic as seasons or even a courseplay type system on the base-maps would have been a major addition in my opinion. Textures of certain crops are way of, such as wheat; the crop is about 1.5m tall if not taller, and is so thin its laughable. 

As I have said preveiously these are SOME of the problems I have decided to write about on what is quite a large list of 'could haves'

Its a more polished version of FS 17 with a few new features.

And honestly, thats great. I simply don't understand the people leaving negative reviews because the core gameplay is the same. What the hell did you expect? zombies? a battle royale mode? Theres only so much you can realisticly do in a game primarly about farming. Anyway...

The bad:
[list]

[*] Bugs. Ive encountered a few more since I first wrote a more positive version of this review about 4 hours in. The most glaring right now are a weird floaty physics issue after putting logs in a pickup and removing them, a sound hiccup when using the chainsaw, and a visual glitch with rain coming through the cab of certain vehicles. Ive also heard about multiplayer connectivity issues but as a single player only person I can't comment.  These issues exist as of 11/20/18

[*] Reported issues with connectivity and control bindings not sticking with wheels, pedals, ect. as of 11/20/18

[*]Seasons and the Follow Me mod still haven't been implimented into the base game. Seasons I can kind of understand since people have strong feelings on the mod both for and against , so its absence is probably a calculated decision.
Sim-ers are a fickle bunch


[*]Vehicle list is a bit small. That's been the case for every farm sim game on launch and has to do with licensing difficulties. Still, if you're coming from a heavily modded version of fs17 you'll probably be a bit disapointed. 

The good:

[*] While not mind blowing, the graphics look a bit crisper and cleaner. In particular, vehicle interiours look a lot less 'plastic-y' Hard to descibe but compare fs17 and 19 and its noticable.

[*] The new start from scratch game mode is a lot of fun, and so far works just as advertised.
It's probably the only way I'll play the game from now on.

[*]The maps, while small, have alot more detail and are generally more fun to explore than those in base fs17. the devs clearly took insperation from the modding community.

[*] Sound improvements. the vehicle engine loops sound better and the rain sound effects are much better. 

[*] Tweaked vehicle handling. Vehicles in FS17 all felt stiff and toylike. more like driving an RC car than a big piece of machinery. While still not perfect, theres a sense of weight behind them now. There is however the physics issue mentioned above with pickups as of 11/20/18

I'm very pleased with this game. It does a very good job of building off of FS17.

There are a few things that do take some getting used to:

1: The driving feels very different because the stearing is much slower. This makes the vehicles feel much more realistic. If you don't like this, you can change it in settings.

2: The store is organized differently.

3: A vehicles horsepower actually matters. No longer can a tiny tractor pull a masive tipper. Also, hills will make pulling more difficult.

45,45914958,english,"1st steam review!

I love this franchise and have put in almost 700 hours since FS15. Overall, it’s a big thumbs up from me. While its not the complete overhaul a lot of people always seem to expect but just adds more content and improves on foundations set out in the previous sims.

Pros:
Graphics are a definite improvement, not huge but definitely crisper and cleaner all round from cabin to general textures and scenery. Draw distance is reduced even when pushed to full settings so there is a bit of pop in, but it doesn’t affect the majority of gameplay. Sounds are better and even through some are re used from FS17, they seem more polished and sound better generally. The Start from Scratch & Farm Manager modes for career are a welcome change and give you a lot more flexibility as well as the field/land buying system. Much improved and makes a lot of sense.

Cons:
The driving control is still well below par, driving most vehicles above 25/30 mph is still skittish and very unrealistic. Would have hoped this would have been looked at as been an issue since fs15 and probably before. Might be me being thick but also a really annoying oversight is the lack of road or track placement to go with the buildings. Until I work out how to do it or update/mods are released I’ll have to settle with my farm buildings surrounded by grass with no roads or tracks to connect them. Again, not massive but seems odd that wasn’t included. Stability when handling bales/pallets etc can still glitchy and tedious, dare I saw a tad worse than fs17? If I stop whilst carrying a pallet on a tractor or telehandler etc then the vehicle just hovers backwards at 2/3 mph. not got to silage yet but am interested to see if that’s been improved.

Conclusion:
I paid full price and don’t feel like is should have waited for a sale. I think a lot of people (but not all) leaving the neggy reviews get so hyped up in the build-up they are expecting a completely new and revolutionary game, so when it comes out the improvements that have been made don’t live up to their expectations and they slam it. Its honestly a very solid entry into the series and when mods arrive over the next few months it’s going to be even better. 8/10. Thumbs up!

52,45914521,english,"I love farming sim 17, I have quite a few hundred hours on it, and I was really looking forward to 19. Unfortunately it is a bit of a disappointment. 

PROS
-  graphics do look better than 17 with some nice touches such as crops bending as you drive over them and birds appearing on the fields.
- more complex crop management where you'll need to lime, fertilise, weed and plow depending on crop type.
- new way of buying parcels of land rather than individual fields.
- animals and farm house are now placeables allowing you to build the farm as you please.

CONS
- missing a lot of equipment that came with 17. i.e. no bale pickup trailers. no seed or fetilizer placables, no greenhouses etc
- tools are split up into confusing groups e.g. seeders and planters - both do the same job!
- encountered annoying bugs such as seeders missing chunks out of the middle of fields
- only 2 maps which are pretty uninspiring.
- pointless things like having a dog included over including useful stuff.
- general feeling that too much has been missed out that DLC has been made a priority.
- no improvement on basic AI. Why did they not implement some of the AI mods that were out for 17 such as the powerful ""follow me"" mod.
- no Steam Workshop integration.

Overall this feels like a very very lazy update. While the new graphics are nice it feels like too much stuff from 17 has been left out either to be patched in later or added as paid for DLC.

If you're looking for a good farming sim then get Farming Sim 17. If you've already fot 17 then probably best to stick with it at least for the short term and wait for mods and DLC to become available to fill in the missing gaps.",1542726373,1542726373,False,6,1,0.548985779285430908,0,True,False,False,76561198004088470,414,14,1098,0,103,1598828238,,
53,45914405,english,"For old fs players: if you believe perfection is in the detail, get it. Thats the strong impression it gives from from the moment you get in.

I can also understand why this is getting mixed reviews.. because 95% of this game is exactly fs17. Its the same game. With an immense details buff everwhere you look.

There's probably also an issue that this game was hyped before release and because of the same game effect doesn't hit the expectations on first impressions.

My highlights and lowlights are:

- The level of detail in the maps makes me very excited for mods and the included maps are decent finally.
- The lighting improvements are just above subtle but amazing when you notice it.
- A subjective problem from fs17 is carried over, i think cabin muffling of the audio is way to strong and you lose the beautiful sounds of the engines and equipment, some people like to hear this.
- The start from scratch mode, the main feature i was looking forward to, is not satisfying at all. You do start with a bunch of money.. but not enough to buy anything decent with so you're left not poor either but in this limbo state doing contracting which won't progress you in a meaningful way. I would have prefered a more established farm with hardly anything.. or a cut down easy mode rather than limbo. You don't even have a house! It feels very disconnected to the RP like premise it implies.

Minor things
First thing i noticed was that the combine, when i press W is unresponsive for like 2 seconds. Yeah i know you may say this is minor but its not. When i try to make a U turn to harvest the next row, which in the narrow spaces of my farm i am forced to go back and forth, this is so annoying i would say its enraging. 
Next thing i noticed that pissed me off personally is that i press A to turn left, and when i press D to stop the turn it just turns the other way. 
Next thing that pissed me off is that when i am not moving and i press A it turns the wheels and they stay there, turned left. I would like this, if i had a steering wheel console, but from a keyboard, not its definitely on the minus side.
Major things
And now to the elephant in the room. The placeables. I absolutely got excited when i heard about the new system but i am no dissapointed. When you place a placeable, it creates a square which has a plateau on top which is level, but on the edges, there is a small steep clifflike curve that you have to climb and it looks horrendous. And if that wasn't enough, you are paying to create this ugly thing. And you pay A LOT. To create a simple chicken coop that normally costs 20k, you have to pay AT LEAST a 50k markup for the ""leveling"" for a price of at least 70.000 for chicken coop.
But wait, there is a solution. You can always place it ON THE MIDDLE OF YOUR FIELD ! Genious.
Now i know that they probably thought, hey you have to sacrifice field land to place your animals but i don't like being forced to do what the developers wanted me to do. I want to place it wherever i want to place it and i don't like being punished for not wanting to kill my awesome field. So yeah. This game isn't ready.

Tractor models look great, sounds are amazing, driving feels great on keyboard or controller or with wheel.

PROS:
1.) Good graphics 
2.) Shop now sorted into different categorys 
3.) Better looking UI
4.) Now they offer you to select they way you start (with machinery or without)
5.) Animations are looking good with nice tractors that required mods before

CONS:
1.) Steering wheel support is there but every time you restart game you need to adjust settings all over again
2.) Even if graphics are improved still same 2D textures on fields (when can we expect 3D fields?)
3.) A bit complicated start for new players that doesn't have experience with FS before
4.) Modders finishing their games (they take mods from previous versions and implement them in new game)

In general good game but still lacks some stuff or needs to be improved. Giants pls fix steering wheel support if I already invested money to play game I want to have full features as before.

81,45907703,english,"First off this ""review"" is after 3 hours of playing only the forestry aspect, as such this is mostly pointless for those that have no plans to invest in forestry.

For a early launch review I say this game is great. I am running windows 8 with an Nvidia geforce 760, and the game is running very smooth with no crashes or framerate drops.

There are several bugs I noticed really quickly, but none are gamebreaking so there is no point in discusing them as they will likely be fixed in a patch or two.

As for the gameplay I am enjoying it. I chose to go with the from scratch start and I like the idea of chosing where you first start out. Now, like I mentioned I have only played the foresty aspect so I will focus on that in comparison to farming sim 17.

First off, trees can only be cut down on land that you own. Whether you view this as good or bad is subjective. To me it is more realistic without being overly complex. Now to the pros and cons of forestry in FS 19 as opposed to FS 17

Pros:
1) You can now just drive your wood trailer up to an area and hit a ""sell all"" button and all the wood in your trailer is now instantly sold. No more need to unload it.
2) There are more foresty vehicles in the game than in FS 17 and the game starts you out with enough money to easily afford some of the good ones.
3) That extremly annoying part of FS 17 where you would put a small branch in a woodchip grinder and it would spit it back out is no longer a thing in FS 19. The woodchip grinder doesn't spit small branches back out anymore and it is much easier to get the wood in there.
4) It doesn't seem to have the ""too many trees"" limitation. After cutting down only 3 trees on my land I was able to plant 20 saplings without any problem.
5) Lastly, when picking up wood by hand it no longer constantly drops from your hand like it did in FS 17. You can move and turn fast or even hit stuff and the wood stays in your hand until you let go.

Cons:
1) A few new trees were added, and they are even more annoying to cut down than those white trees.
2) As mentioned you have to own the land before you can cut down trees. However most of the land with trees is on hills which not only means more potential to tip over when using a crane, but to plant saplings you will need a decent horsepower tractor to make it up the hills.

All-in-all I like what I see so far, and am eager to play more. I feel this game will easily be worth the money paid for it. Only other problem I have other than the annoying new trees is the absence of passive money makers in the placables tab. In fact the placables tab of the shop is very bare bones with very little to chose from. Although mods and updates will likely fix this. On the plus side animal pens are now a placeable so you can actually chose where you want your animals. Which also means that if people make maps that are nothing but forest to clear like they did in FS 17 than we can clear land and raise livestock. Still though I do miss not being able to have solar and wind farms.

In conclusion though it is an improvement over FS 17 minus the obvious lack of so many placables.",1542684071,1542718807,True,13,1,0.59864342212677002,0,True,False,False,76561198025812610,155,10,20312,0,2657,1600556593,,
82,45912792,english,"Major let down in my opinion from someone who is an avid Farming Simulator Player. I have only dived into about two hours of gameplay at this time but I can’t see my experience recieving much improvement after writing this. The game has an overall “meh” feel to me. I’ll explain each of these points below. All in all if you have FS17, I’d stick with it. From the large amounts of uproar in the Modding Community and Giants turning a blind eye to those who make their game and the players experience better I wouldn’t get my hopes to high in anticipating plenty of quality mods for FS19. 

Lacking Game Changing Features: I started up the game anticipating the same giddy feeling I had when I originally launched FS17.  From the dynamic grain planes, tire bulge, wheel slip, all of these things though minor in the grand scheme of things were things I myself loved to see from a game. The attention to detail and steps made in this game to show it is becoming more realistic. I unfortunately didn’t have this experience in FS19. Nothing truely jumped out to me as being drastic or even small changes I enjoyed (probably the only one I noticed is lighting, which is great, but I’d rather have IC integrated, dynamic graintake volumes, or something of the nature).

Plenty Barrowed from FS17: So so so so so much if this game is borrowed from FS17 it sickens me. Combine grain tanks are exactly the same. Crops being pulled into the header by the reel is the same exact graphics, crop textures, growth states, visuals of grain, the dynamic unloading of grain, and on and on and on. And I understand the fact that the game is building off of the same premise as the Farming Simulator Series has, but all of these things may be small, but they truely would have caught the eye of any experienced FS Player and truely shown that Giants wanted to overall make this game and the community happy, rather than barrow a bunch of old things from 17 and make 0 changes to them. 

“American Map”: How many times are we going to be promised an American Map and have Giants fail to deliver, my goodness! You pick up your farm equipment from a “used car dealership”. The field spacing, road layout, dynamic of the map, terrain, landmarks, someone please point me to anywhere that has this screwed up combination of the stuff Giants heaped into this map. I hate this map so bad, and I’m certainly not going to touch the other one. Give me back Westbridge Hills!

I was highly disappointed with this game and my find myself sticking to FS17 for the time being. There are honestly no major features or minor ones that draw me to 19. After waiting up in anticipation all I received was letdown.

It should be called Arcade Farming.

This game is about driving machines, so why not focus on improving the simulation and physics of the vehicles?

Where you have change gears, toogle 4wd mode, locking the diffs for not beeing stuck in mud, or on a hill?

I do know I can get mods that makes it more realistic - But seriously, this is a simutation game, it should be build right in.

You should be careful when unloading in the pile. (Trailer could fall over if your trailer is crooked)
You should be careful when going around a corner too fast. (The tractor to tip over)
You should be careful not to buy oversized implements to your small tractor.

4 Where are wind turbines and solar panels ?

Worst parts are near edges of map where they placed hills with ugly blurred textures so terrain looks like a cheap android game. I would say most modded FS15 and FS17 maps are far superior than this.

in its current state. 
Missing essential ingame items ,machinery / equipment . Not as fan of the new crop symbology nor the lack of infomation on some quests Poor quality Map with limited information and the inability to port around to investigate. 
Graphics are currently not up to the hype even after tweaking settings 
With that said   I do like the principles being applied where you purchase land blocks not just the fields  and can only work on land you own ie Mowing, forrestry etc.  A quick look at the set up for multi player shows great potential 
I will certainly be watching to see if fixes / improvements  are applied over the next month or so and will reconsider re purchasing it then .

18,45909987,english,"what a shame, it seems that this is just the 6th copy of farming simulator 08 with minor improvements here and there, the only real improvments i see is an increased ammount of vegitation with decent textures, and an overall graphical upgrade, altough in some cases this isnt really visible at all, even though im running the game on its absolute max settings.

the bad things, the harvestable crops still look absolutely horrid, the texture on them has always been and still is ugly.

still no force feed back, for forcefeedback controllers. and it still maps your controller to everything! so instead of jumping in and playing, youll be spinning around and walking sideway's without you touching anything (also already a problem since farming simulator 08)

the driving ''simulation'' is well the same as it has always been in this engine, unresponsive, togheter with the non existing physics simulation on things like the tires suspension etc etc. this makes driving feel bland and boring after a short while, as it did with every previous farming simulator.

no dynamic ground again, eventhough games like Spin Tires, or Cattle And Crops, simulate that flawlessly, both studios with a much smaller budget.

overall it seems like it is just another slight reskin of the previous version, with some new brands crops and animals. 

to me it still plays and feels the same as farming simulator 08, and after 6 reskins of that game, im kinda done. if the next itteration of the game doesnt bring some significant changes to the engine, then im out and done with this title.

There were a couple of big ones but over all the number of fields appeared to be reduced. I got my download and spent 30 minutes in game.

I've been playing FS since FS2009 when bale stackers weren't even a thing and you had to remove rocks from your field. So far, my experience with FS19 has been good, but not exactly what I expected. It's a good game, don't get me wrong, but some things just feel a little off compared to FS17 so far. I didn't get that feeling when going from FS11>FS13>FS17, which is why I feel its worth mentioning. The lighting is new and neat, but sometimes it feels a little too glowy and fuzzy compared to the more neutral and sharp lighting of past games.

 One thing I tried tonight that i definitely was NOT a fan of was the reworked chainsaws. The sounds are not configured correctly so going from idle to revving will sound very choppy and weird, and the transition as you begin to cut a log and ""move"" the saw in front of you feels very broken and awkward. This becomes even more of an issue when you are trying to walk along the felled trees and limb them and your saw goes crazy!

Constructable farms: it's a cool concept, but at this stage still feels kinda awkwardin 19.  FS17 offered a good amount of this and might have actually offered a larger variety of different placeable sheds and etc, so it's not as much of an improvement as I was hoping it would be. 

Maps: These new maps are pretty highly detailed, but a lot of areas just feel overly crammed and small compared to Westbridge Hills or Sosnovka from FS17. I would have liked to have one map that was more like those, or an updated version of them, and then have another map that's more laid out like these new ones, but that's just my preference.",1542694253,1542694253,True,8,0,0.579506635665893555,0,True,False,False,76561198019960064,165,3,6576,0,596,1595220131,,

For the people moaning about seasons mod, while yes i did enjoy it, it has its pros and cons as well and perhaps if it was implemented newer players may have found it a little bit more complex, im sure the creator will likely make a new iteration of his mod for this game.

3.) Workers seem to be much more intelligent.
4.) Information is easier to find (in general). It's a tad bit overwhelming at first, though.
5.) The two new maps are very nice. I was worried it'd be a rehash of FS17's DLC.
6.) I like the handling of vehicles. They seem to have weight now.
7.) Love the vehicle preview.
8.) Still has good mod support.
9.) Really like the mission list.

Things I don't like:

1.) Why can't I open doors yet? I have all these worthless building I can't do anything with. I have a garage with an interior I can't enter. I have a house I can only use a fraction of.
2.) No older equipment. I know mods will take care of this, but it's frustrating from someone who used the Old-Timers pack from FS13 almost exclusively. I love starting with very cheap equipment. I'm hoping the Stalinec S-60 will be ported quickly.
3.) Microstuttering on very high graphics. I'm not quite sure yet if this is an issue with my PC or the game not being quite as efficient as it can be.
4.) No people? The world seems a bit empty. I may just be not seeing them, though.

AMD FX 8 core processor with an nvidea GTX 960 with overclocking enabled and the game still runs like poop even on reduced settings... 

The brightness of the atmosphere is white washing everything at best (i know you can turn it down but wy is it so bad out of the box?) and the driving physics are laughable. Constant FPS drops rip you out of immersion and the general lack of the so called ""build your own farm"" buildings is ridiculous. There were more buildings and sheds in FS 2015 for goodness sakes.

On a positive note the introduction of JD was a nice touch but really? No JD equiptment? Seems a bit strange.
I think the best part for me so far was driving through a patch of crows and they flew away as i got near. Now thats kinda cool. i also really like the plot buying. A great addition to the game if there was more of a point to it aside from tree cutting and ""shed"" placement... 

The tractors are one of the saving graces though. they are beautifully modeled and the sound great. The lighting of the game takes that away though. no shiny paint. no glare. the paint is flat and lifeless imho.

as for everyone who says that this isnt farm sim 2017 youre right but also wrong... many if not all of these new features aside from horses exist and can be added to FS 2017 free of charge with mods and run helluva lot better. 2019 has better foliage density and grass textures but realisticaly ive seen better maps on 2017.

After waiting months for this game i feel ive been let down a lot. this is coming from someone who had 2013 2015 and 2017. every year it got better... not this year though. 

At this moment it really pains me to say it but i dont recommend this title in the series. ill put it on the back burner for now and see what happens but for the time being im going to reinstall 2017. :P

Heavy harvesters Spinning 180 on a dime,

Worse mouse sensitivity issues than fs 17 had (which I didn't expect) the faster you move your mouse the slower the camera moves (why did they think this was a good idea), 

Clunky UI with symbols and no words for the main in-game menu system so you have to guess what each section is, 

Harvester headders in a sepperate location from the harvesters themselves so you have to back out of the menu and go into another one (the game has a customisation feature when you buy harvesters, headders should definitely have been there), 

Requirement to set the framerate limiter to 0 due to badly selected hard-cap,

Maps that feel smaller than fs 17, even if they are the same square footage (they might not be but it's what they feel like that counts to me),

Shop icons often come without words even if you hover over everything,

One section where you see your garage doesnt let you select your garage items so you have to find the main garage section to click on them,

Most things take several clicks to get to,

I have plenty more to add on this list too and it would make a wonderful project for a write-up on just it's lacking UI design accessibility alone, from what i have seen so far.

Honestly, farm sim on the nintendo switch kind of works better than this, has better framerate control, the UI is better, some items don't have words but it's not as pronounced as it is in this one, the main menu UI design is more logical.

So far 100minutes in game. 
Have had alot of fun so far. 
Plenty of choice in the game modes.
Key binds are carried over from previous FarmingSimulator** where aplicable.
New features, cotton, horses, chickens and more are good, great additions imo.
Over 300 vehicles/tools to use on the farmland, Beautifully reproduced all with moving parts, cool as heck.
As with all FS releases we get two wonderful maps to start with, More to come incl' from the tallented Mod community.
Contains a robust options menu to customize the game to run on most common low end to high end PC's. (always check it out and adjust for best results)
The Contracts look to be fun, similar to 17 but more than 17. incl' delivering the contracts goods to a selling point, point to point deliveries and so on.

3,45906390,english,"OK so i dont write very many of these but i feel like my fellow gamers might wanna know before you buy.

Little over an hour in game and here are me thoughts.

Graphics: GREATLY improved over 17. The game is beautiful. Amazing even. even with mid gen equipment (gtx 970 etc..)
Graphics = A+
Tractors/equipment: A lot of new items in game for all sorts of different activities. including some never before seen items.
T/E = C+ (recieved a lower grade due to more does not equal better. there are more options per type however once you have the best of the best there is no need to downgrade, overall its nice to have options but end game they make little to no impact)
Buildings: New ability to place your own buildings like silage bunkers means no more traveling accross the map to tend animals etc... just buy your plot and get to work.
Buildings = A+
Horses: this new livestock option is a nice addition however really no different than cows in 17 other than you can ride them.
Horses = C (no real change for use of animals than previous titles, other than riding)
Multiplayer: As of launch multiplayer was bugged for my friends and I. once a farm was created the host froze in place with a crash to desktop being required. Im sure itll be fixed soon but milldly annoying for a launch. The advertised multiplayer should prove interesting though. with each having their own farms and wallets, a big change from previous titles.
MP = C/B (pending fixing)
Price = A (these titles have always been a good bang for the buck with several hundred hours for the farming gamer.)

Overall: A decent upgrade over 17, however dont expect much in the way of OMG and WOW moments. Usability/playability has gone up slightly but unfortunatly owners of 17 could very well continue until they felt the need to spend the money for the upgrade in graphics and a little more effeciency. I do recommend it however I have requested a refund until the multiplayer has been resolved or perhaps the first DLC pending content.",1542675424,1542675557,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198006182828,238,3,9700,0,1478,1591634101,,
