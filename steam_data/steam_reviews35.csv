2017-09-20,0,0,136,True,Not Recommended,This is the most poorly optimized game I have ever purchased and spent time playing. My system settings meet and exceed the requirements but I still have the game crash on load in building textures not load on dropping and system sounds never load in. Instead of working on any fixes or patching on core game files they bring crates and take it to competitions.

Game doesn't even let you connect to the server half the time. But hey they added loot boxes which looked alright at first since there were no keys but now you have to pay in game currency for the loot boxes as well as real money for keys. And the loot is half trash not interesting in the slightest. I am against microtransactions most of the time but in games like Overwatch and League at least you can see time and effort has been put into the skins.tl dr just play Fortnite.

2018-04-15,0,0,1274,False,Recommended,Let's see. Almost 1000 hours into this game i am ready to give my opinion. 1. This game needs to be optimized as soon as possible. The lower limit of the fps can go as low as 45fps while i'm playing on low to medium settings on a GTX 1060. It is annoying and lethal to both my mouse and computer table.2. Server is always busy and SEA is somehow laggier than AS when i live near Singapore.3. SEA's server still doesn't have TPP yet after so long. WHY DO YOU FORSAKE US? WE PAID FULL PRICE FOR THE GAME AS WELL.4. The hacker issue has subsided a little bit as compared to the month of January and February. During those two months out of 10 games 8 of them was infested with hackers.5. Region lock China.Still I'd recommend PUBG simply because it is still fun despite all its flaws.

2017-08-28,0,0,422,False,Not Recommended,"EDIT Dec2017 Hacking is still there not as bad but somewhat playable but apparently the script that fixes the hacking is something like 6000000GB of data that is causing the game to rubberband (unplayably for the first 10 minutes of the game) even with a high end computer and executing some steam launch options that give it even more dedicated power. I honestly can't believe they made so much money and still can't hire someone with a clue.EDIT 26Sep2017 The new patch claimed to clean up some of the cheating like the overlays for ESP. I reinstalled to give it a shot and honestly it does look a lot better. I did have a few instances of people still loading in game without textures and shooting me through walls as well as a few ""fishy"" kills using auto fire at 200m with every shot landing but those can be circumstantial and just luck. I am going to give it a few more weeks see where it goes and I may change this review. Something has finally been done so hopefully they keep up the tempo.Edit Nov/2017 The cheating is still bad I just had a good run of luck lately but no it is back to as bad if not worse. Here is a link to a guy cheating still and this is what you see in almost every game https //www.youtube.com/watch?v EQQ2OZqTRiM. Auto Aim is TERRIBLE and obvious ESP is still being used relentlessly. Sorry these guys are not doing what they should be doing and sorting this problem out I can't give this a thumbs up. This game will stay as a negative review until it is released and this problem (if ever) is sorted. Don't buy it if you are a serious gamer that enjoys friendly honest competition you will not have fun. This is a hack fest. I do VERY well and usually end up in the top 10 if not 3 but the majority of the time that is because I identify someone that is obviously hacking such as auto aim a full auto AK at 200km to land every shot and avoid them. This is trash another great idea with devs that don't sort out the hacking. Sadly gaming is on its way down the tubes because of these cheating losers. Sadly this is a negative review. The game is FULL of cheaters if you don't cheat you are going to lose. It seems EVERYONE is using ESP. They claim to have banned them but that is BS. You can search YouTube (highly recommended before buying this turd) and find TONS of people blatantly posting their exploits time and time again and STILL not getting banned. Do a search for ""Best PUBG Hacks AIM &amp ESP (Undetected)"" in youtube for a perfect example that was posted less than a month ago. These people have made a fortune claiming 8m copies sold and they still dont even give a damn to fix this problem. Just another bunch of leeches taking money for a potentially good game and letting it go to hell like Rust and all the others. Don't buy this crap unless of course you are a hacker you will have a great time.Otherwise could be a great game but its not its full of cheaters. DONT BUY IT",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

But game forcing you play desert map. You cant choose what map you wana play and getting old map ise lower that %50 percent for some reason. why ?!Game ping issues is lot worse than before new map come out and some reason desert map is lot more laggy from old map. By laggy i mean you keep teleporting arround like since game start to 10 20 min.Only good thing about 1.0 is the fps fix. they did a great job on that but again ping issues was first rate problem not fps.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

It's janky it's buggy and it's hard to get a good feel for the game.It's hard to 'get good' because of how inconsistent the game feels. Just when you think you have it down you empty a clip on a player standing right in front of you and fail to register a single hit.I prefer the more realistic approach PUGB takes compared to something like Fortnite but this game just isn't fun to play. Dying in consecutive matches because you can't find a weapon. Walking aimlessly for 20 minutes and dying without being able to fire a single shot. These things don't make for a fun game yet this is what you will frequently encouter playing PUBG.I have over 300 hours put into this game and I still don't have a good feel for it. It's impossible to learn when you're constantly fighting against server lag desync issues hackers bullet reg problems etc. How can you learn from your mistakes if you can't tell if the problem is you or the jankiness of the game?,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-11-25,0,0,92,True,Not Recommended,PUBG is an excellent game. I am not a big shooter person but this game and it's mechanics are fantastic. The shooting works well and the part luck plays in the game makes it almost like a game of cards.The reason I can't recomend this game is due to the fact that it's in early access. I hate the early access business model. Instead of having a free beta they make you pay money for an unfinished game. The problem with paying to beta test a game is that the devs have no incentive to continue working on it after they already have your money. Its been months and they still have yet to fix the horrible sound direction or add a vaulting mechanic. The amout of deaths you'll have due to glitchy t and poor sound direction makes this game almost unplayable for me. My advice Wait until the game is finished then buy it. I will revisit the game when it gets released but for now don't buy PUBG.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-18,0,0,339,True,Not Recommended,Firstly this game is super addictive but there are far so many negatives and outtings that annoy me so much that I change my review again.Pros Good graphics Pretty good FPS Never struggle to find a game It's fun (to a degree)Cons FPS drops in certain areas bad hit detection Always get killed in a car shoot at a car and you never hit them. Wear a level 3 vest shoot someone with level 1 vest but you die even after hitting them with 80% of your magazine. Level 3 helmet get killed with 1 shot with kar98k use M24 on level 3 helmet (twice as powerful) it just downs them. Screaming players down the mic making you deaf unless you mute it. Laggy doors. Opening doors but never open or do but has invisable force field causing you not to enter thus getting killed. Unloading a full clip into someone for them to 2 shot kill you even with you having full body armour. Cheaters so many cheaters with auto aim etc to win. Imagine Call of Duty campers.... times that by 10 then that's the campers on this game.The game is fun but most the time I feel like throwing my PC out the window nothing more annoying than having level 3 helmet level 3 vest and getting 2 shot killed after shooting a full UMP clip into that person. If you want a bit of fun at the start then disappointment after a while of realising the games faults then this game is for YOU!!!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-22,0,0,27,False,Not Recommended,A true testament to wasted potential and greedy developers almost beginning to remind players of a vile publisher known as EA. Maps are large but static. Gunplay feels punchy but stiff especially at range. Movement feels floaty vehicles don't navigate very well if they happen upon odd invisible geometry. or just explode for no discernable reason. The game causes even higher end systems to huff and puff despite not much at all happening on screen especially since the only destruction in the game is picket fences and glass windows the desync causes many frustrating deaths from around corners with the new kill cams not really shedding any more light as to how you died. The community is torn because of the devs inattention to hacking and constant ping abuse from Chinese players while they continue to push more paid cosmetics and CS loot crates which are purely for streamers because lets be honest here without Twitch this game would never have reached this point.

2017-09-14,0,0,172,True,Not Recommended,For an anime fan the gameplay of PUBG is very similar to BTOOOM! Therefore I would firstly give some credit to the creator of BTOOOM! followed by a great appreciation to the Devs of PUBG. Keep up the good work guys. Although I would recommend PUBG for pretty much any player who loves to play and are open to different types of games. But since it's still early access do expect some unexpected bugs which somehow for some odd reason the bugs have added a bit of bitter sweet flavour in the game. Also because of certain unfairness due to unfair banning please hold on to your steam credits at this time. Otherwise you'll buy something that may DIE OUT in a few months. Not worth it.PS After having read some posts and the concerns of other dedicated players in the internet I would like to plead to the Devs to PLEASE STOP THE NONSENSE OF FAVORABLY LISTENING TO THE CROCODILE TEARS OF some STREAMERS (although they made your game famous) AND ALSO PAY ATTENTION TO DEDICATED GAMERS (because whether you like it or not they also contribute if not 90% more than 60% compared to streamers in helping your game to be popular without them having to get paid). Would be great to see an actual stat of how often stream snipping happens compared to banning. Also streamers should just expect to be stream sniped and get over it.

I personally don't like how the game doesn't have a ""hold in to aim"" button option. You are forced to aim by just clicking once. It is not something I'm used to. You can change the aim button with scripting but it will bug out your character once in a while (it will walk slow as if it is aiming although it isn't).The only good thing about this game is that it is currently super popular and it has a high demand on rare items so you can earn quite much money on e.g. an in game skirt which is only visual.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Now the weapon skins that i have seen people using (i dont play anymore) they seem like a last resort kinda thing to try take old pubg players back from other BR's and other games. Personally I don't like the look of the skins as pubg doesn't seem like a game that should be bright colours and cheery when i played i tried to have dark camo clothing because of the theme of the game realistic. fortnite on the other hand they way they have skins is perfect bright obvious cool looking skins that work with the cartoonish fast paced version of BR.Eventually I may consider playing again but for right now the game is stale and boring for me. also miramar sucks worst map ever4/10,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

(Yes I am FULLY aware that there are also free crates and that if you really want to receive some cool cosmetics being dedicated to grind doesn't hurt.)

Not to mention the terrible mechanics behind vehicle driving. Looting was spotty ...id run through 2 3 houses and find nothing but backpacks or a pistol. The loot needed to be fixed. Everything about this game screams no more tha $9.99 ...but somehow i got dooped into paying $30 for this awful excuse for a Battle Royale.

2017-03-31,0,0,600,False,Not Recommended,This game is really good far better than any battleroyal game I have played before. However do go into this game with an above average pc as it can be a little hard to run.Edit 1 After drastically increasing my hours in a short space of time I have become highly addicted to this game and after upgrading my pc I have very little performance problems any more and all problems are swiftly being dealt with by the devs. The development team for this game is exceptional they are constatly releasing bug fixes and everymonth release a new patch adding lots of new content. For me personally this game is not part of the early access for ever stereyotype as the dev team has not delayed their release date as of this review and are 2 months from their supposed full release (I hope).Edit 2 Fun fact I said that in april the game was fully released in december and in 2 coming up on 3 months since then there has been no new content. They have announced stuff but who knows if that will just get delayed like everything else. This game is a bag of Its still badly optimised better than before but still bad the hit registration is still bad especially in close quarters I can record me doing the best spray of my life fully staying on a guy and it takes 30 bullets to down him. Not to mention how unreliable shotguns are I can shoot 3 shots at a guy see the blood splatter on all of them then he 1 shots me at the same range and oh look he has a quarter health left. Should I add all the micro stutters whenever someone pops up my pc isnt amazing but it is still above average I play with people who have insanely good pc's and they still get micro stutters when someone pops out on them.The crates yay lets grind to then have to pay money and that will rest my case for them i dont want to rant and get into that section of micro transactions just please split up the pay to open crates and the free to open crates.Time to discuss the bad quality of the awful desert map and all the stupid in that. Like buildings in major cities that you can't open thats a good idea when you need to loot fast. It probably is for performance reasons but when you are trying to loot your first building and you find out you can't enter it you are completely ed and have no hope of survival. Not to mention the buildings that are built around the vaulting of the games but then they arent checked to see if they work an example is there are these 2 multistory buildings in a spot I cannot remeber where but on the top floor balconys you should be able to vault and walk across a wooden plank to the other side but you cant because there is some random thing in the way and you cant get on top of the plank from one side.As a simple way to put this game is lucky timing look at h1z1 for example that was the game before pubg that everyone thought was going to do amazing but they didnt do enough for it and the game was too buggy and badly optimised. The only reason pubg was seem as the globally amazing game is that it was the best of a bad bunch and people had so much hope for it me included as you can see in my earlier reviews I even loved it but what they delivered is PUBG is only as good as it is because it came out first and had Brendan Greene (might have spelt that worng) with it so it got enough hype and then it got all the media support. However if Fortnite BR and for example Darwin Project had come out before PUBG it is likely that pubg would have boomed again for being super tactiacal but bust quicker and harder as there are better alternatives avaliable at the start. Unlike now where it is constantly called its reviews have tanked but enough people bought it and there are enough die hard fans that it will not die. It's like having someone immortal but then mutilating all of their limbs they wont die but they are useless.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-09-21,0,0,0,False,Recommended,Would be an absolutely amazing game if they were to optimize it for preformance. The servers are almost as bad as Rainbow Six Siege's back in 2016 before the second year/season update of operation health. Servers going in and out throwing up errors players not being able to log on and get online etc. Bluehole needs to (at least) start optimizing the game to run more predominantly on the Unreal Engine. I feel as if the game does not offer enough graphics options. Some of the reasons why I personally think the game runs so terribly on most computers is because of it's extravagent materials textures and assets that are required to execute when the game loads as well as particle effects amount of players and GPU cost of rendering these as well as drawing over them. Anyways I am still going to reccommend it. (As if it matters what I place in my review) My point is Player Unknown Battlegrounds would be a more enjoyable game experience without the issues I talked about which may seem difficult to fix but is vital for your playerbase and community to stay interested as well as gain new players.EDIT Don't buy this rushed A piece of hit unless you have a god tier PC/close to the recommended specs or above.

I wouldn't recommend playing on high settings at all but it's to show that PUBG is definetely a lot more playable than it's been.As for the game it currently features two maps (three sometime by Q4 2018?) a good variety of weapons and attachments. Sure they really need to figure out the regional server issue which I'm sure they will but overall it's still fun whether by yourself or friends. My only big complaint are the hackers which they are currently trying to combat with an anticheat system. Nonetheless still good and playable.Older Update Pff so these guys were like ""hey we're gonna fix the performance issues a little more and stuff""Ha okaOh wait they kinda improved it.Okay I can write this review now PUBG isn't too bad of a game. It can be fun if you're into the battle royale type of games like H1Z1 DayZ or even Minecraft Hunger Games. Sure performance isn't top notch but it's definetely more playable now. Whether solo duo or squad PUBG has a lot of fun aspects and you can have a lot of cool and funny stories from the game. It's a race to be the last standing on now two very large fairly okay maps.

2017-11-25,0,0,334,False,Not Recommended,I loved this game at first. Who doesn't love battle royale games? Arma 3 then h1z1 and then this gem came along. However this gem turned out to be a fake diamond. The devs do not really give a they say they do but their actions are too slow. They say the game is incomplete but they knew they gave us a deadline for version 1.0 so they just threw some piece of better running for us. But now I could live with that because the majority of devs just do not care. What has pushed me over the edge was the hackers who ruin this game and I am not just trying to explain away loses. I just got done playing a game where we got killed by a really suspicous Asian player. Turns out after watching the replay that there was not just one squad hacking but there was a total of FOUR squads with at least one person hacking for a total of seven hackers. This is not the only game as well. I am uninstalling this garbage until they fix the hacker issue but I doubt they will fix it in any meaningful way.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-10,0,0,480,True,Recommended,Is it buggy? Yes.Laggy? Yes. Full of hackers? Probably. Rage inducing? Yes. Is it fun? Absofnlutely. All issues aside this game is a blast to play. Do I die from seemingly bs all the time? Of course. Maybe they're cheating maybe I suck more than I thought I did. Extremely laggy at times rubber banding back and forth across the map team wide 'network lag detected' popping up randomly client crashes and way too much audio fluctuation can be extremely annoying but when it works (let's say 80% of the time I don't have any issues) it's awesome.It's an early access game so some of the issues are understandable but patch to patch performance tends to vary which is sort of a bummer.I don't regret buying it at all even if I do curse the game the company and whoever kills me for whatever reason it happens.

Starting with nothing players must fight to locate weapons and supplies in a battle to be the lone survivor. This realistic high tension game is set on a massive 8x8 km island with a level of detail that showcases Unreal Engine 4's capabilities. Pros Large area of playing fieldMuch more complex than any other battle royale based game (H1Z1 KotK)Beautiful graphicsInteresting map with diversityPlayer customisationGood weapon balanceReasonable accuracy with weaponsGame turn out based on strategy rather than luckCons Poorly optimised (constant stutters game just feels unsmooth)Few bugs (can sometimes get caught in buildings when parachuting down)Graphical artifacts (I think this is only a problem with few AMD cards)No ranked match making (not exactly expected considering it's only just been released) Conclusion This game is very good considering it's current development stage and provides interest for fans of h1z1 who are getting bored of developers ignoring requests. It has allot more depth than other games whilst still providing good gameplay and graphics.Rating 7/10Worth it? Definitely worth the extra 10 price tag! Yee,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Lastly the player base /language barrier . yes there is alot of wonderful people out the in the pubg community but when you actually play the game it seems like 70% of the player base tru out all the servers are chinese and most of them only speak chinese . i'm a chinese myself and i think this is pretty unfair for all the non chinese out there .No doubt this is a really a fun game but it also has alot of space for improvements it really upgrade almost everything they're offering right now as the player base is booming .,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Most of the issues listed below have been fixed but have not yet been deployed. My original review can be found below. PUBG is what you get when the wrong company makes the right game.The game is extremly enjoyable however the corporation behind the game PUBG Corporation was not the right developer for this. They have prioritized banning innocent people sueing other companies and quick money grabbing updates (ads on Chinese version and crates) over fixing issues with the game such as terrible performance clipping lag and much more.This game is in Early Access that means the company behind it should prioritize FIXING and FINISHING their game before adding UNNECESSARY garbage like cosmetic crates and ads (yes ads eventhough you already paid for it) to their game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

There are no patches or updates EVER to fix any of the issues. I personally think the armor system is stupid. Sometimes it takes 7 shots to kill someone or two to the head with an AWM if they have level 3 helmet. I just think the game would be so much better without armor. There are a lot of things to list that I really don't want to spend the time listing. I really hope someone comes out with a better version of this style of gameplay.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-04-07,0,0,31,False,Recommended,Brand new fresh review. I have to say I was playing fortnite for 6 months straight now I've quit and am heading back to pubg. Why if you give a simply because fortnite is getting boring and repetitive. As far as optimization goes the game has had a massive boost in frames. Currently can get about 130 fps on high settings 1080p. Sometimes it drops when flying out of the areoplane. Is it worth full price still? No current sale is when you should buy it. Normal retail price should be like minimum $23.99 $33 (I'm australian).Last time I picked up this game the map was boring nothing looked fun to do except snipe people. Now they've made it more interesting by adding 4x4 mode which I died within 5 seconds of landing. What type of pc can handle it Not i3 series because I used to own an i3 2120. GPU GTX 770 and higher. If you've got the money spend $400 on a gtx 1070. I'd say for cpu go for i5 6400 or i7 4790. Ram wise you're looking at 8gb but lets be real nowadays chews up more then 8gigs in the background so at least 16gb ddr4. If you're on nvidia Go to your nvidia control panel and change the settings from quality to performance may make it look like slightly pixelated and but will improve performance. The game it self needs more optimization but the devs have been doing pretty good. One thing I will say though which I agree with is region lock ing China. And yeah.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-03-07,0,0,406,False,Recommended,"While I recommend this game let me make this clear I am not happy with the game in its current state. While I love the rush that this game gives you and the realism present the game is not easy to play. Dying behind cover happens all to often due to client side hit registration which is infuriating and the fact the game is unoptimized and bugs run rampant is also a huge let down. And the locked crates? People criticize EA for the Battlefront II crates and heroes but this game makes you pay $2.50 for a key to open a SINGLE crate containing a SINGLE item. All in all features that would make this game much more enjoyable are The addition of content more freqeuntly IP Bans for cheaters with multiple offenses Optimization Server side hit registration More ""game changing"" content (Most of the content recently added has been exclusively cosmetic) More frequent updates Dedicated ServersPUBG is a $30 game that has a lot of potential but Bluehole has dropped the ball. With all the money they have already made off of this game they should easily be able to hire more staff and give their game dedicated servers.

Frantically I'm searching every single room. ""Gimme a gun gimme a gun!"" I find A baseball hat... Summoning up some courage I tell myself ""Whelp he probably hasn't found anything either let's just go in and have a round of fistycuffs!"" I charge out the door and am greeted by a guy that looks like he's just finished the end game of fallout 4. He has a gas mask leather trench coat lv 3 back pack lv 2 helmet.

Their melee combat is also unusable in its current state.

2017-09-23,0,0,114,True,Not Recommended,Firstly i have to start this review by saying that when i first played this game i was completly obsessed with it. The first 20 30 hours of play were really interesting and exciting and it genuinely felt like a new gaming experiance i had not really had before. However after this duration of play i started to feel that many elements of this game felt really one sided and frankly not very well designed. Early Access or not there are some big problems with this game.The gunplay in this game is good the weapons have a fairly nice feel to them and are fun to shoot this is a big draw for a lot of people especially now FPS mode is avaiable in the game. The collection of items is also fun as long as you don't spend too much time doing it each match.PUBG exceeds at certain elements that many other online PC games fail at in a big way. I think that the game has really shown a lot of promise when it comes to playing with friends the game is pretty much designed to be played with at least 3 people. The way it almost forces players to work together using the compas for enemy location callouts and also develop vocal stratagy to navigate a combat situation is compelling. However this is frequently undermined by the fact many people find it easier to just sit and wait for players to show up and kill them. The design is there to promote team play but the game is actually easier to play when you just sit on a hil top with a sniper rifle and don't move for 80% of the match. Nothing is more flawed in a game than when it has mechanics to promote a type of play but frequently is too fussy in other ways for players to properly impliment these more team based skills.To elaborate on my criticisms above concerning team play. In a team based game luck should not be the defining factor. Unfortunatly luck plays a major role in PUBG. And one might argue that luck is a part of any multiplayer game which is true. But many other multiplayer titles give you ways to reduce your reliance on luck in the form of perks and killstreaks and other bonuses. There are of course problems with these systems too however PUBG gives you no tools to reduce being at the mercy of luck. You can get a perfect loadout of amazing guns and gear but all of that is just a distraction half the time. You could have a fully upgraded weapon and good side arm and mountains of health items but someone with a stock uzi can still just destroy you almost instantly. The argument against this is that the more players you have with you the better your chance of survival is which is true to a degree as you can have more eyes on the landscape that way and thus better chance of spoting people creeping up on you. But when it comes down to gettign into combat many people never really use a team mentality and your team of 4 can be destroyed by one or two people often. And i think this is becuse of what i mentioned above of the game giving you very simple tools to comunicate a complex combat landscape. Even if the game had small features like sniper scopes reflecting the sun and more cover would make the whole experiance of combat so much more enjoyable. Becuse of this very sparse toolset players will frequently just sit in stractures or under trees and wait for the plasma wall to reach them before they move.Half of the time in the game you feel like you are in an empty server and frankly the boredom of the mid game is unbarable. Its hard to imagine a survival shooter to be boring but somehow PUBG manages to be one of the most boring games i have ever played. Only the very skilled will run around shooting at everything and i think this is where another big issue of PUBG lies. The skill required and learning curve on this is immense generally i have no issue with hard games or games with a high learning curve i'm certainly not unwilling to take a challenge to learn a game inside and out. However PUBG just has the wrong kind of attitude to skill and learning. It has this constant feeling of repatition that you can only improve by dying over and over and over again and learnign a tiny bit each time. It has no payoff it feels like more of a grind than most long and drawn out RPGs. And some people will tell you that the crate reward system is payoff. It isn't. The PUBG Pioneer Crates or just loot boxes is another disapointment in the long line of disapointments this game has to offer. With rare items having a worse drop rate than most other loot box systems in any other game with this terrible feature i hav played. Often players are left with garish outfits that you can spot a mile off. Which hinders gameplay. Some may choose this but frequently the loot boxes offer little to no satisfaction with the items avaiable the fact that you get duplicate items is also just embarasing. Having a character you want to play as in terms of visual apperance is almost a pointless ambition in this game.The visual character of this game is very standard and effortless. Ranging from very light post apoc themes to mostly really boring average military gear you have seen a billion times in other games. This game could have really held my attention for longer if it was visually compelling and made me want to spend time getting a good loadout then getting killed after running 20 mins through a pretty sci fi or fantasy landscape.While on the subject of landscape it is actually probably one of your biggest foes in this game. The level of physics bugs and irritating camera problems when interacting with the landscapes is going to be madly frustrating to new players and will get you killed loads and loads of times before you learn to awkwardly work around them in your own way.To bring this review to an end before it goes on too long i have to say as a final conclusion that while overly negative i feel all my points are true and are problems for many people and not just myself. I wanted to really get into PUBG and enjoy it but after 100+ hours my patiance is just worn thin. I would warn many people looking to buy this game that it is probably better to buy this game when it is out of early access. I think that way many people can play it an not feel like i do and want my 100 hours back and my regret for bying into this game that has been disapointing and has a terrible online and streamer community to boot. I do feel that many of this games problems are not becuse it is in early access though. its just badly designed and feels almost like it embraces those flaws to make people frustrated enough to keep playing to get better which in my opnion is objective bad game design at its finest.I cannot recomend this product to anyone.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-11-27,0,0,386,True,Not Recommended,The overall concept of the game is great and if they had fixed everything this woule be game of the year no doubt. The problem is the poor optimization resulting in lag disconnects and bad frame rates. on top of the there is almost a cheater is every round and it makes the player feel like they were cheated when they were doing well. A system similar to Valve's VAC ban system is needed that scans the players PC for any cheats. The method that is used as of this review is simply not getting the cheaters banned and there is no feed back to whether or not your report actually got the player banned. If these problems were fixed I'd highly reccommed this game as for know I think I'll play Fortnite with the majority of the other players are going.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The are alot more guns and you have the abillity to add attachments on the fly.

Honestly This game has potential but really this game is in the wrong hands and the developers don't know what they are doing with their game and not know how to make the game worth time. They should stick to MMORPG's because this game will not go anywhere if the only thing they see is an oppertunity for money which will eventually happen. Definetly not worth 26.99 for only 60 hours of fun more than 60 you become aware of the amount of this game has.

2017-04-27,0,0,1013,False,Not Recommended,"Edited 17/01/18I still stand by my original review this is by far one of the most fun games I've ever played and I highly recommend it.However...I must make people aware all through the early access phase I never once encountered a serious hacker issue maybe in the entire time of playing since release there was possibly 3 different times where there may have been a dodgey player but difficult to tell since release however the EU servers are completely and I mean completely filled with Chinese speaking players and lots of blatant hip firing 300m+ headshotting hackers with the replay function its so obvious to see the amount of hackers that are around now and it simply is ridicules. The Asian servers need to be fixed so they can play there as Chiese speaking players completely dominate most lobbies over voice chat and I'm sorry to say it but most of the hackers I've encountered seem to be from the group of players too.Vehichles are still far too glitchy and need addressing and things like shooting through a chainlink fence are still a total nightmare.We still have no sign of mod support which was claimed to be a big thing from the start I for one would love to see the game opened up to the point where we can have custom maps and such so much potential for modding on this with game modes and genres e.g. Space Jungle Medival(with weapon change up) maps.Don't hold out on us fix what needs fixing we wont hang around forever and the more you release these ""paid for"" skins/creates without fixing issues present from day one the more you annoy the loyal players that have stuck around and supported from the start.I'm changing my review to a thumbs down until I see a genuine response to resolving the Asia region issues and hacking issues as they are seriously effecting the enterity of the game currently. Original Review For me this is by far one of the most fun and addictive games I've played in a long time.No stupid pay to win or outlandish costumes/skins just plain and simple scavange kill run repeat.Don't get me wrong it needs some polishing and it's well on it's way there I experience menu/loadscreen glitches for my first game or two each day but actual gameplay is relatively flawless with the odd rubberbanding once in a while. The melee system needs some major work imo and grenades need a quicker way to be thrown.The guns seem relatively well balanced the vehicles work nicely and the looting is very random so always a different game every match. I would urge the dev to work on things like fences and railings however as you don't seem to be able to shoot through things like wire fences or stair/banistair rails which can get rather infuriating. If your looking for camparisons to me this game has the thrill of looting I got from Rust Legacy the Battle Royale style gameplay from H1Z1 KOTK(though a far better quality production) and the tactical teamwork capabilities from the likes of Counter Strike Battlefield etc. All in all a very fun and fullfilling game.The price seemed steep to me at first but I can hand on my heart say I'm very happy with what I've paid and the quality of game I have recieved and its updating and getting better each week. From my experiences I definately recommend this game.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-11-27,0,0,73,True,Not Recommended,"Extremely flawed in its current state but an all around good contribution to the Battle Royale genre. Bluehole have proven that you don't need a big AAA budget or huge development team to compete with the big dogs. However PUBG still has a long way to go to be the ""complete BR experience."" It's still a buggy mess and lots of promises (2017 is nearly over) that have yet to be delivered (vaulting new maps etc.). Bluehole seem to be the masters of teasing.With games like Fortnite Battle Royale showing up late to crash the party and offering a slightly more casual experience it will be interesting to see how the PUBG community shapes up in 2018. Again given its current state PUBG is not ready for competitive online play. The potential is there but the game state has a long way to go in that regard.I'll be rooting for PUBG albeit with a very skeptical eye in 2018 when it comes out of Early Access. Only by then can I truly recommend it to others.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-11-24,0,0,665,True,Recommended,"I joke it all the time ""LoL eSpOrTs ReAdY"" because its got some really things that occasionally happen.But I've invested a ton of hours into it because its incredibly fun and incredibly satisfying when it goes in your favor. The biggest thing about these types of games is you don't win all the time so if you get killed you have to shrug it off and requeue. Even if you get killed because of some of the bugs (one way fences for instance)... you have to understand everyone is facing those bugs you just got to be the victim of bad positioning. Do I recommend it? Absolutely. It can only keep getting better and BlueHole seems to want to support the community by updating it and making it better. I'm eager for the performance improvements in 1.0 release and I hope that the game continues to grow.

The game itself has some good fundamentation cool gameplay style decent graphics but still it lacks on the basics of a competitive shooter and by this I'm referring to good servers that take count of at least ALMOST every shot (PUBG's server are not even worth mentioning) and good performance because pubg has many performance issues making fps drops frequently gamers with better rigs have a huge advantage when up against lower end computers.SO if you want a battle royal game and you like playing tps i would recommend you to go for another game Fortnite's allways an option but if you're like me and only like fps than you don't have many options.I play PUBG every day I get mad at it 'cause the game sucks and I won't recommend such game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The game has too many cheaters fix the cheaters or add region lock for china. JUST DO SOMETHING ABOUT THE CHEATERS!Overall I like the premise and hope they continue to add to it. I would like to see a system in place for people who play alot they can get small increments of boost. Like at lvl 50 (500 hrs) you get plus 1 hp or an in game emblem or something. Just something minor like that it wont affect gameplay that much but it gives you something to work towards once you unlocked the pants you want.Mainly I want clothing to give some benefit to wearing it even if its just minor. For instance if you are wearing pants with knee pads you get 1 percent reduced fall damage or something.I will add now that I have played it for more time there seems to be in increasing amount of 'odd' behavier. Things like ppl getting a headshot on you with an m16 from 600 m away with their first bullet while you are running through a forest. lucky? maybe. Cheating? probably. It seems like 1 of 3 games I'm killed by someone who does something like that. Sometimes its fair but 35 percent is alot of times to not be angry. Im to the point currently where my friends ask me about this game I tell them. ""its fun for a few games but theres very little almost nothing to work towards and the things there are to work towards are just clothing that do basically nothing and can be found in game anyway plus theres A TON of ppl cheating. So no dont get it.""Armour should do more and clothing should mean something. BUT MAINLY THEY NEED FOR FIX THE CHEATING.The average game has between 1 and 5 AFK people and it causes the mid/late game to be slow (sometimes they really cracked down on this). Its ruining the dynamic of some of the games but is much less big deal since they made it so you dont get farming points anymore.Edit I took out some parts as they were fixed but the rest still stands. You are able to report people super easy and that seems to do nothing there are cheaters everywhere. Like 5 10 ppl in every game are using aimbots! The game is gaining alot of ppl and it doesnt seem to be slowing down which is nice. You still die VERY VERY quickly and that is incredibly annoying. I do think that the devs need to add micro transactions along with the free box to give extra clothing. The reason is if ppl are buying the paid box then the devs still get money and thus are more willing to work on the game. If you ever wonder why games get abandoned its because there is no longer a reason to update them either they have made all their money or the cost of updating is more than the money they will get in return. Plus clothing still does basically nothing so its not pay to win like ppl think.I very much have enjoyed this game but there is little here. I really hope the devs continue to update the game and change some things. Like for example there are bullistic face masks that dont reduce damage at all. There are vests that are suposed to add armour but seem to add very little and you die very quickly even with them (lookup youtube videos of the damage states for them they only block like 1 bullet and sometimes non).",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-02-26,0,0,135,False,Not Recommended,Totally worthless game.Pros Not very expensive Nice graphics Can be quite fun sometimes but mostly on solo (no annoying reviving bullsh*t)Cons constant crashes that requiers to restart my PC (cannot kill process in task menager) D**k sucking server tick rate (constatly shots not detected by server especially on the beggining of the match) Random fps drops (often exactly in moment enemy player peeks playing on low details on GTX 970/i5 4690 8gb RAM game installed on SSD) Terrible hit detection (i.e. bullet from SKS landed directly on enemy chest but game detected it as hit to the ground) Poor rng (too often struggle to find anything better then pistol vs enemies that lands directly on SMG/shotgun/rifle or zone closing on the other end of the map) Totally annoying peeking. Game doesn't show any kind of indicator if the gun's barrel is blocked by obstacle (like in Rising Storm). Also it is quite often the rifle barrel doesn't seem to be blocked but bullet still hits your cover/ground. Squad playing is broken (ability to revive fallen squadmate infinite times without need of using any kind of resources i.e. first aid kit. Headshots doesn't matter 'cause you can revive enemy anyways.) Unbalanced weapons (M16A4 or M416 have nearly no recoil and have similar damage to AK47 which recoil is nearly uncontrolable even when tapping on single shot mode) Loosing HP during proper parachute landing. Hip shooting on short distances is much more profitable than aiming through sights poor sound (Jeez in CSGO I can hear how far is the enemy and find out directly the sound of the steps in PUBG only left/right/in front/behind also steps sometimes can be heard from millions of kilometers and sometimes its impossible to hear enemy sprinting few meters from you) Higher ping advantage. As developers made amounts of money beyond their expecations they forgot that game content should be improved. Instead of improving tick rate adding new maps/weapons they add useless stuff such as plane icon.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Not only do they refuse to ping lock the regions their ""anti cheat"" measures are complete trash. You shoot another player in face with an entire magazine of 7.62 nothing. He's turns and pops three rounds with a pistol you're dead. The mechanics of this game are terrible. The amount of people who know where you are at any given time is by far the worst of any multiplayer game I've seen. Check out pubgradar.com if you don't believe me. Blueballs doesn't seem to care about that now do they? They're probably the people behind it. Worst money I've ever spent on a video game While this game is endless fun for you and friends the absolute refusal of the developers to instill a ping lock to keep well known hack players out of the North American servers heeds a thumbs down review from me. It is widely known and understood the vast majority of players from Asia play on NA servers with either blatent modifications to their game or pings so high it's worthless to match them. A simple ping lock would fix this issue for millions of players yet the devs refuse. Why have a marketplace or community for a game that is so easily hacked? Why permit cross region play when ping is going to be an obvious drawback? Great game and fun concept especially with friends. Terrible operation of servers update implementation (7pm PST? Seriously?) and an obvious disdain for their playerbase with the refusal to ping lock the regions.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-03-10,0,0,148,False,Recommended,What can be said about PUBG at this point that hasn't already been said a million times? It's a very strange game. It's a disaster but somehow still comes out on top. The game is filled with bugs inconsistencies network issues and very questionable design choices... Yet still ends up being a very addictive and fun experience when it works. This is a game that forces you to run around and loot items for 20 minutes risking to lose it all by a mere bullet to the head by some random guy 1 km away who had more luck finding a sniper than you did. It can be infuriating but also very satisfying.The game relies on tension. You know that if you die you could lose it all. Maps are very open so you can never be sure if someone is watching you or not lining you up on their corsair as you're frantically rushing away from the border that'll cause you a lot of damage you can't afford to deal with. Being dropped into a huge playfield with 99 other people and praying you (or your group of friends) come out on top can be very nerv wrecking but also very intense. The fights you do win gives you a feeling a lot of other games can't and I think it's this feeling that manages to keep the game engaging and keeps players coming back.You'll probably hate a lot about this game. I know I do. But what it gets right it gets right very well.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

After all these months game still feels like it's in early access. Optimization is sh*t there are still many glitches and also they implemented skins for weapons which doesn't suit this style of game (it's not cartoonish style game like so that it fits the it's style!) they took idea from the games like fortnite and few other games!Also this game has one of the worst ever net codes that i've ever faced in a game and their servers are sh*t (i have fiber optics internet so the problem is not on my internet side). AND MOST IMPORTANT thing this game was made in wrong engine which limits the how the game works/plays (both server side and game side).All in all this game is SH*T and i wouldn't recommend it to anyone.I have a lot of gameplay in this game so i know what i am talking about.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-03,0,0,52,True,Recommended,I have had a lot of fun in this game and it was worth the sale price I paid for early access. That said it still needs polish IMO before it should exit early access.My chief complaint is that at the start a player is often at the mercy of the random item generator which seems to like to generate multiple copies of the same 2 or 3 items in a cluster of buildings. I don't expect to see every building have 1 long gun 1 shotgun and 1 pistol but 3 buildings don't need 8 quick pistol clips yet no pistols. That said there have been a few rounds that I started with nothing and managed to slink into the top 40 before finally finding an unused long gun and that felt like an accomplishment. But those are rare cases I usually just get sniped without ever having any means of defense.Other than that I think there are either lag or hack issues as I have either been shot through walls or my computer never rendered my opponent rounding the corner (I'm on gigabit fiber so I don't think the lag is on my end).So while I recommend the game go in knowing it still needs refinement for a good balanced experience.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Big map Vehicles to travel faster You can play with friends in duo's and squadsCons Very bad optimisation the FPS is low and there are frame drops even on very good computers and this is a very important factor given the fact we're talking about a shooter The tick rate is just bad too bad... Again we're talking about a shooter... The competitive system is not very well done I don't feel like competing for a place in the world I would rather like some division like system or something similar A lot of bugs but I will not lower it's rating for this because it's still early accesThere are good things and bad things about the game but overall it's fun to play even better when you play with some friends. I consider this game the best ""Battle Royale"" at the moment mainly because it doesn't exist something better at the moment there could be something better but apparently the big studios do not care enough to make one. The good part of this game is that it has a capable team behind it that until now seemed to really care about their product so we may have a surprise after it's full release.

2017-09-23,0,0,133,False,Not Recommended,Unless you speak Chinese cheat and like watching the leaderboards fill up with people who do cheat don't waste your money on this game. Ever since they opened it up in the Chinese markets the game has been overrun with cheating. The devs abandoned the steam forums because players complained about too much cheating so now the forums exist solely for Chinese players to post the sales sites for thier various cheats and the rest of the world to complain about Chinese cheaters. Bluehole got their money and then basically told the players to go to hell and ignored the gameplay problems uncontrolled cheating and massive amounts of teamkills all in favor of more fast cash and immediately started to create the console version. Squad no matter where you are in the world is composed of 90% Chinese speakers so bring your own team of disconnect your headset because it's useless unless you like listening to every person in the Chinese internet cafe because they can't figure out how to push to talk or just don't care. Be prepared for your team to kill you if you get a better gun than them because they have much envy. Plan on dying in the last 30 seconds because that's when the majority of cheaters turn on thier aimbots and autoshots because that's what happens. If you play solo expect to see the cheating from the minute people exit the plane. At least in squad they tend to wait until the end.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-30,0,0,203,False,Recommended,This game is really fun. I switched from H1Z1 to PUBG and it's helluva fun. But one thing that plagues this entire game is perfomance issues. I thought I was the only one experiencing this but after some research alot of players are experiencing this. When I land most of the houses aren't rendered properly they look like that someone made them from clay. There is no collision whatsoever and I can't loot what's inside so there's a high chance that I won't be able to defend myself because I didn't have any weapon! Another huge problem is whenever I open up inventory by pressing TAB the game freezes for few seconds or more. Performance while playing Solo is alright but playing Duos or Squad is impossible. Because of the huge FPS drops and whenever I want to shoot an enemy the game freezes for two seconds or so. I tried all sorts of fixes from typing in launch commands to tweaking commands in the game folder. It looks like that it helped a little bit but I'm still experiencing the problems. At this point I can't recommend this game.EDIT So the performance got a bit better. I dont get FPS drops that often and the game doesnt freeze when I open the inventory. But one thing that blows my horn is that the buildings STILL DONT RENDER. I CAN WALTZ RIGHT THROUGH THEM LOOT THEM AND WALK OUT THROUGH THE WALL!!!!!!!! A guy was in a building a building that wasn't even rendered at all it was just empty space. I could see him whole it gave me sort of a wallhack which made it unfair. I dont want to get called out a hacker just because of game related glitches and bugs.Edit (as of latest update) After the major update the game performance is even worse the buildings are not fixed whatsoever my game begun to crash freeze for few minutes. I don't even want to play this game anymore.Edit (Major update)Performance got wayyyyy better buildings started to properly load new map is my favourite because not only it does not lag that much but also it's a new experience and a smaller map which is why it's action packed. Now I would recommend buying it.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-06-22,0,0,28,False,Recommended,One of the best games in steam to play. Visual are good. But the game is very poorly optimised.

2017-12-21,0,0,77,False,Not Recommended,"Bought it and it is very fun but it has alot of issues. I'm judging this on 1.0 launch. Chinese people are on most server so it's best to hide early game so you stop lagging and can actually kill people after they all die. $30 is not a bad price for a game honestly but it looks like it's gonna have microtransactions if it doesn't already. Sure they are just ""cosmetic"" but in a $30 game is kinda low. Csgo is like $7 and I can kinda understand why it has that but $30 is pushing it. I never played or followed this game til today and it could be hard if you forget to unplug you xbox controller like me so when you look at stuff or try to do anything it says press B and you are like WTF nothing is happening and then you get killed by a chinese guy with a crowbar. These are the only issues I have so far after 2 hours. I hope they fix the servers or at least lock chinese people out of US servers. Let them play in Asia EU and other servers. I get man is risking his life to play PUGB but that shouldn't be my problem and it shouldn't be anybody else's. If they fix servers get it if they don't it won't be worth it. A game like this with laggy servers will kill this game.EDIT 6/22/18 They have a Battlepass in a $30 game. In a f2p game like fortnite thats acceptable not in a paid game. Don't buy this. They haven't fixed any bugs or ways to cheat in a year. They want people to cheat get caught and get banned so they buy like 50 new keys and keep on cheating.

See you on the battlegrounds!Edit Came here to change my recommendation. Too many cheaters. I'm not talking once in a while. It's gotten to the point where at LEAST half of your games there will be a guarantee hacker. This needs to be fixed immediately and very sad for the developers to have this problem for so long.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2018-03-10,0,0,210,False,Not Recommended,After over 200 hours played in this game I can say that its most glaring issue is the gunplay.It's like RNGzus decides whether or not to bestow upon you bullets that will actually hurt people from match to match.I'm constantly putting shots on targets who are both near and far who are not even moving that leave me with no indication of whether or not the shots actually affected them. Yes there's the blood splatter that pops up when you successfully hit someone but what I'm saying is that I find quite often that it's not present even though I'm hitting people. I've put people down many times without seeing a single blood spray at both close and far range.This is a huge problem because I'm constantly second guessing myself as to whether or not I'm actually hitting my target. Since I can never be sure I'm hitting my target due to this I find myself getting extremely mad and frustrated believing that I'm not even hurting a person standing 10 feet away from me while unloading an entire magazine that realistically probably wouldn't connect with every shot anyway but should be more than enough to kill a person.I like the sense of realism that comes with a yes or no did I hit my target judging by the blood spray system but when it's so inconsistent it drains all of the fun out of the game. Many other FPS games include a system that leave no doubt about striking a target I.E. hit markers. I'd much rather have the blood spray system but if the developers can't make it work then maybe they should give us a band aid hit marker system until this is fixed.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

There is a report player option that shows up about 5% of the time but never has when I was actually team killed. #2 I play with an xbox controller I'd like to be able to adjust sensitivty of the joystick it's waaay too fast when aiming (so I have a mouse on my couch arm for when I need to aim).

2017-08-13,0,0,251,True,Not Recommended,Got into game. Once I landed I was able to walk through every building in sight. They looked like half formed blobs barely resembling buildings. After trying to go up what I can only assume was a ramp. I fell through the floor and was stuck with half my body int he ramp. When I exited the game throuhg the menu the game froze my pc and after about 2 min I was able to get to see my desktop but the game was STILL running. It was hogging 96% of my ram thus making everything move very slowly. I was unable to close it from task manager so I manually shutdown my pc. The only good thing about this game is the cleaning session it sparked once I shut down my computer.EDIT Second game.... Crashed after clicking play on main menu.EDIT Continues to disappoint.

Don't judge too much pls XP.PUBG is fun and i really mean FUN while retaining the ""challenging"" aspect of a competitive game. The exciting feeling when playing this game makes it fun storming into houses getting stormed finding nothing but trash finding level 3 armour and helmet in one spot airdrops landing right above you sniping random people running head first into a bullet hard carrying teammates feeding getting high on discord(to my own embarassment) etc etc.Stealth aim prediction game sense positioning strategy teamwork coordination and even luck are all factors that PUGB tests you in (maybe not luck because that cannot be tested from person to person its random)But definitely play this game with your friends because that makes it more fun by 10 folds.Despite the occasional hacker mopping the floor with my entire team (by occasional i mean like 1 out of 20 games) i still think PUBG is worth my money.

You will find the recoil of the guns the spray and overall handling to be completely and utterly broken and to me at this point so stale and unable to work with. You will get shot by enemies in buildings you cant see in or shoot in due to some prison bars. You will spend 3k on a PC and still hate this game. Ive spent so much time and i honestly cant say i like or even slightly enjoy the game anymore. New crates no new guns no updates to optimization no road maps no blogs or anything. This will be the game that ruins BR IF they do not get their together. Simply if you like having fun and enjoy pc gaming for the experience and to dominate this game is far from that.

2017-07-04,0,0,214,False,Recommended,"07/04/2017I very thouroghly enjoy this game. It is definately more fun with friends however. I recently refunded this because of my poor ping but once that is fixed I will for sure get the game back. I recomend this for anyone who enjoys PVP or arena games.Edit I switched ISP's and re purchased the game. Runs smoothly and at the time of this review have 18 hours logged which isn't much but I have been playing alot recently. Great game overall.03/11/2018Update Despite the massive fluxuation of negative reviews I still hold form to my original opinions on the game. I would recommend it to everyone and anyone with a PC capable of running it and would DEFINATELY recommend this hunk of beauty over the overly hyped and arcade like gameplay of Fortnite. Since the recent update people seem to be complaining of frequent frame drops and delayed item spawns which I have experienced myself despite not having played for quite some time. This issue can be solved with an easy fix and very popular idea of removing the cosmetics spawn alltogether from the loot tables. In case you haven't noticed yet there's a ton of cosmetics in the game with no lack of new additions. As of right now just about every one of those are included in the loot tables. This is obviously a major suspect in the issue of early game performance issues and delayed spawn times. Keeping some of the cosmetics wouldn't be a big issue either but only if there were a small ammount of them and kept at a low priority durring spawns. Another new addition people seem to complain about is the newly implemented emote system. I personally think that it's a great idea and something that we have needed for a while. As unpopular an opinion it may be those are my thoughts. Those who are against use a few common arguments such as ""emotes are not needed because it makes the game too much like Fortnite"" or ""why do we need a system for stupid things like dancing a slow waltz over someone's dead body?"" Fortnite's emote system is utter cringe and dumb as hell I agree completely on that argument but Battlegrounds' emote system is different. It's not completely composed of mockery or old trends but rather useful handsignals that can be used to communicate without the need for a mic. Emotes for things like waving surrendering and even nodding in aproval are all included and useful for different scenarios. Ever tried telling your teammate where someone is only to be in two different posistions making your bearings different? There's an emote for pointing so now you can give a more accurate visual instead of saying ""that tree over there."" So not everything is as bad as some say it is. Overall despite it's issues PUBG is still a very enjoyable game.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-09,0,0,545,False,Not Recommended,"Well so I guess I should also write a review about this game...I'll keep it short and simple.The game is ridiculously fun when playing with friends be it duo's or squads. I've made countless memories and had some of the most tense moments in any video game. The learning curve is steep when you are new to the game since you have to get used to the gun mechanics and you will most likely die before you even see who attacked you. But you will find that you keep coming back to it. ""Just one more round"" or ""We can't end the night like this"" are just some of the phrases heard during every pub game. But unfortunately these phrases have taken a turn for the worst lately...At the time of writing this review hackers are destroying the game. Most games end by dying at the hands of the most ""skilled"" players the world of PUBG have ever seen. Be that they can see you through walls or that their aim locks on to you they are everywhere. In my last game I got killed by a guy with a machete in a bulding 100m away from me. He just hacked at the wall (I saw this through the death cam afterwards). Fun. The developers keep on flashing all the awards pubg have won in front of everyone's noses as a selling point but it means nothing. They have milked the cow and are trying to squeeze the last drops out.I have played since early access and the games has had many ups and downs. But the state in which it is lately is ridiculous. DON'T BUY THIS GAME if you are wondering about it. At least not in its current state. It's disgusting. Except if you are a hacker....then I hope you rot somewhere dark and moldy because you are the lowest of lowest among toxic scum in online gaming...seriously...",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The new anti cheat system is messing up fps at this time (you get random fps drops all the time)3. Cant play the game because the fps drops so your buildings dont load in time plus you lose fights do to the drop in fps.4. The severs are trash.5. Dont trust hills. (a hill you would be able to walk down you die to because you glide down it and take damage from it)6. Landing from parachuting you take damage from once in a while. ( you will be going to the ground and land on ground but still take damage some how)7. There is more but at this point you might as well go play fortnite bud. It is free and better developed at this point in time till PUBG devs get their heads together and work for making the game a better play experience and not work to making a moblie game making new maps and stuff like that. That stuff can be done later on when they dont have to fix preformance issues and dont have to deal with hackers.I was all for PUBG and didnt like fortnite but today I had to deal with another hack and fps down so that got me mad and now I'm going to play fortnite till they come out with an update for this game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-03-11,0,0,215,False,Not Recommended,I tried to like this game but honestly after putting time into it I can't. Between not having my shots register teleporting around being killed by someone on another continent before I can see them and doing the same thing over and over again with no variation I have realized that this game is simply boring and unfun for the majority of it. Maybe this game isn't for me and you will enjoy it however I believe this game was a good idea very poorly executed and surviving on the number of overall players rather than the content. It also doesn't help that instead of optomizing bug fixing and adding new maps and content asked for by a community of over thirty million we instead get lootboxes that you need a key to open. At least we can look pretty playing on the same two maps of a game a year old.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-11-10,0,0,637,False,Not Recommended,200 hrs in. Okay plenty addictive and can be very funny. However over 30 million copies on steam 4 million copies on Xbox. That sums up to more than 1 billion dollars. And THIS is what we get after a year of release? Still just 70 developers? Graphics are not impressive but descent. Extremely poor performance from your rather average pc poorly optimized to map design. Rubber band lag flicker lag hard lags ask for it and this game has it for you with its crappy servers. Remember its now V1 0 they are essentially calling it a finished game. Hire more people because it is progressing too slow or at least make an effort into hiring competent people. Next update? Guess what amazing stuff we will get? Emotes. NOBODY asked for that! We must realize that probably a dedicated animator(s) did this but id rather have more versions of reloading an AK vaulting a wall and etc than dumbass dance moves that doesnt belong in the game. ing pathetic Blue Hole.

2018-03-11,0,0,421,False,Not Recommended,"This game is *awesome. On it's merits alone I'd recommend this game to anybody that enjoys first person shooters but is sick of the same CoD / CS GO style action. You drop in via parachute along with 100 other players getting to strategically choose where you start across gigantic maps and then you loot and survive. However the reason I'm writing this review is the same reason that as of this point I would NEVER recommend this game to somebody I liked rampant cheating. With each game consisting of you and nearly 100 other players having even 1% of the population hacking ruins nearly 100% of the matches. Now I've managed to get into some games where I'm unaffected by it and have managed to win 10 or so in the 100 hours I've played it. But for each game I've won I've died 10's of times to people blatantly cheating.Though the developer says they're ""working on it "" nothing seems to actually be working. Over the past 5 months or so the hacking has gotten just down right out of control. I can't tell you how frustrating it is to get 20 minutes into a game with multiple kills a great load out and awesome end game position to have a hacker's crosshairs just magically jump to your head when your clearly not visible on their screen or have somebody shoot you with a scopeless gun from halfway across the map when you're lining up a sniper shot with an 8x or 15x scope. This game has turned into something less about surviving the game as it was created and more about getting lucky to not run into hackers within the first 15 minutes.Overall I love what the publishers are doing with the genre and the game itself but it really shows how inadequate or unwilling they are to solve any of these issues ruining an otherwise incredible experience. Ruined so much so that again I'd save your money if you're thinking of buying this and wait until when you type ""PUBG Cheating"" into Google you don't see a million horror stories and actually see signs of progress from the developer.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I would in its current state give this game a solid 7/10 only being due to the optimization if it was better optimized it would be a definite 9/10. other than that the game has great gameplay and a pretty high replay value if you are actual willing to get better at the game instead of complaining and i would most definitely recommend it.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Well here we go stay with me.There's 10 people alive you finally made it to top 10. The circle is quite small but still bigger then your p****. You dont let that bother you though. You hear gunshots all around you not sure where most of them are coming from. You look left and sure enough there's a guy sitting on the tree next to you. You look at him and send his fate of another loss right at him. You begin to think to yourself was it worth killing ""adirtysock"" maybe he just wanted to win like you did. Either way you can't let it bother you as the next circle is already closing in. You crawl on the groung knowing that the other 5 people alive are doing the exact same thing. All is quiet and for a brief second you thought there was some sort of universal understanding that no one will kill each other. Then of course ""moistwheat"" decides to ruin everything and kill someone with a grenade. Then there was 4. The circle begins to move in again forcing everyone even closer together. In your head you start to see things moving. Of course we all know these are normally your typical swaying bushes but not this time. You fire and miss most of your shots since you can't see him that well. He fires back and hits you a couple good times. Then you remember that you picked up that energy drink and some aspirin earlier so all is well now. That's a true champions breakfast. It is now down to 3. You begin to think ""I can do this I can really do this"" but then you see something you could have never predicted. A man by the name of ""QiShinGiyao"" takes out the other dude. All sorts of fears run through your head knowing how many Chinese hackers have gotten banned but not today. You move right to a tree and it seems as if this guy cannot miss a shot.

It's got good mechanics good weapons and a ""mute all"" button for the raging racists that you will probably find in the North American lobbies. Occasionally a game is ruined by hackers but in my experience this is closer to around one in 20 or 30 deaths and is not a deal breaker for me. I am far more likely to die from stupid tactical errors like running across open fields without cover or cowering in a corner while being stalked by someone far better than me. If you can find the game on sale for 20 25 USD it's definitely worth the aggravation lost sleep heart palpitations adrenal overload and general cussing. The only real con at this point is the ""point"" system. You get a certain amount of points depending on rank damage done and kills. These points can then be redeemed for loot boxes. Before the last update all of these loot boxes were free and you could open them by virtue of the fact that you had enough points to get them in the first place. Now though there are several different types of boxes which are given randomly. Several tiers of these boxes now require that an additional key is purchased in order for you to open them. In essence you earn the right to purchase the box with in game points then you have to buy a key to open them.

2017-04-03,0,0,493,True,Recommended,Great Game Rip H1Z1Gunplay and gun variety is so much better than h1z1 tons of different weapons. Attatchments make weapons interesting and create many different styles of play based on what enviroment you are in. Healing is done very well to make sure you cannot spam heal items but also doesn't hang you out to dry for 4 minuits while you slowly heal. Med kits only bring you to 75 health and you need energy drinks pain killers to max your health which give you passive healing overtime. The gun play feels very satisfying compared to h1z1's tap shooting style. You have free reign to spawn in different locations when jumping out of the plane instead of just random spawns. Cars are balanced as it is easy to shoot you out of them but you cant just do a hit and run jumping out of the car at full speed to do hit and runs. If you jump out while the car is moving you risk dying or taking massive damage.The game has some lag and desyncing errors which should be fixed as the game progresses. Be wary if you have a lower end pc this game is not fully optimized yet. The game didn't have as many glitches as I would expect besides dying randomly one time by a door.In conclusion this game is fun. Buy it if you are a fan of h1z1 or other battle royale games buy it. If you are running a lower end pc wait for it to be optimized first. Definentely is an addicting game for you and friends.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-02-08,0,0,370,False,Not Recommended,If ever there was a more unstable and poorly optomized game in PC gaming history I don't remember it.So I played a lot of hours in this game before I decided to write a review. I wanted to give it a more than fair shake given that there is such a large playerbase I thought that it may be possible that it takes time to appreciate and get used to the excentricities/bugs.After a lot of play time I can say that the game is very very poorly optomized lacks basic 101 functionality and is buggy well beyond what is acceptable. The bugginess of this game is beyond what you would expect froma free to play game and is totally unacceptable for a game of the price it is. To make matters worse there are times you can spend as much as an hour trying to get onto a server and the ping times are absurd.Also I'm not sure there is another game I have played that crashes as often as this does. Something else to note is taht the sound is terrible. You'll have no idea whatsoever where sounds are coming from at any moment. You're better off playing without any sound.The only reason this game has any player base at all is the unique concept of the shrinking map. It would be fantastic to see a real game developer come up with a similar concept. Then we would have something beyond this steaming pile of dew dew.Basically here's the deal It started as a great project by a guy who has some serious insight into what can make a great FPS but then they released it early and people liked the idea. Word caught on to a new game with a great concept and more peaple wanted to play it. Soon people were paying full price for a beta (at best) game and then the developers suddenly had absolutely no will or incentive to improve it. Why would they?,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

It is quite fun and exhilariting cool concept and looks/sounds pretty dang amazing..yet there is one major thing that just made my blood boil IMMEDIATLY. It isn't cheaters (something that they seem to be trying to take care of at least *but the actual cause is out of their hands*) or framerates (get a better PC mine seems to run perfect on Ultra in 4k....*so again out of their hands*) Or even how sloooooow you gain Battle Points (unless you get 1st place which most causual people probably wont even get CLOSE...*this is on them totally but I can deal with the grind even though it is beacuse they want people to BUY loot crates. I can still deal with it) However when I bought a special loot crate with hard earned Battle Points I tried to open it and it says I have to buy an elecronic ""early bird key"" to open the lock on the box. ARE YOU FREAKING KIDDING ME?! After supporting this game and paying for it (and even the $30 is a stretch since the game isn's completly working like it should!) I REFUSE to pay another $2.50 EACH CASE to open special loot that isnt clearly labled so!! (might as well just sell the loot box at $2.50 outright and not make it an option to buy with earned points and basically duping players into buying these keys) That is COMPLETE garbage and greedy AF...the game has sold quite a bit yet they still want more .....anyone involved should be ashamed of themselves!!

2018-01-19,0,0,345,False,Not Recommended,I absolutely cannot recommend this game. In early access I could understand some of the various bugs and glitches and occasional crashing but even upon release the game has barely improved and in some ways gotten worse. For one there is the lack of region lock which puts me in lobbies with chinese hackers of which get first place every game. They ruined the already bad driving mechanics (cars lirerally float after hitting a hill as if they weigh less than a feather and when turning you might as well be on a ing ice rink). Running into a 2 foot tall plant at 3 mph takes a 5th of your health away. But the worst for me is the complete innacuracy and seemingly random damage model on weapons. I lose gun battles to fresh drops when im wearing level 2 armor and have watched a hailstorm of bullets from my gun go into them. I dropped in with an enemy who had a 1911 an I had a KAR98 before he saw me I got 2 shots into his chest and he ended up killing me. This game is total and complete trash with seemingly no effort put into it whatsoever and its getting ier with every update.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2018-01-19,0,0,240,False,Not Recommended,I have played this game since it came out but it is getting worse and worse. Gunplay is inconsistent as all hell servers are laggy as and the game's new map is total and utter garbage. It is actually like an H1Z1 map which doesnt fit this game at all. Relies way too much on vaulting. Only good part is that they fixed it to give us 50/50 so that we only have to suffer 50% of the time. But there are no preferences or anything for maps. I only want to play Erangel not too many cities smaller map more fun and less time per game usually. This new map takes 6 ing minutes for first circle and the map is just too ing big. It is honestly a terrible experience. Until they either give us preferences or add in a lot more maps this game will continue to fail. I just don't know how so many people can play it and enjoy it especially solos.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-23,0,0,662,False,Not Recommended,Ok so I have quite a few hours in the this game.Used to play religiously with friends everyday for quite awhile. When I first had found out about the game i was watching a video made by Jack frags where he pushes the game to its absolute max in 4k! The game in that video almost a year ago is a far cry from what the game originally had looked like.Now its like theres a weird static from the foliage that makes the game feel broken. I understand they needed to optimize the textures for all of the in game assets but you could have at least made them look less visually busy.not sure if these issue will ever be addressed but who knows.The gun play has changed drastically from how it used to be. guns used to act more or less like how you would think of those weapons.But with the addition of more weapons. And more amour. (I swear theres like 3 pieces of armour for ever starting player in the game.) The gunplay has been reduced to a contest untill you get shot in the head. or one of your games crashes. the new map is good. the desert map was attrocious. personally had this issue where going to my scope would cause the game to go to 15 frames or desync completely durring critical moments. This game is STILL in EA no matter what the devs say. it was never ready for release.I think my favourite moment was the annoucment of the games release and we all laughed cause we knew tha the game was not ready for release let alone a BETA. This game used to feel like a gritty fight to the death with gorgeous visuals and scary heart pumping fire fights.But now it feels like a shell of its former self.With their exciting ideas for expanding the experience boiling down to being a rip off of the battlepass of fort I have a hard time getting back into this game. And its not even because of all those things. its because the devs knew the whole time what we where asking for but they didnt dare ackowledge it untill they could come out with this PR stunt to give them more light compared to their competitors.I wanted to be excited for this game It was and may be again but i'm not ready to lend them any hope in hell of me waiting for them to finish.I don't regret my time playing this game. but in reality it was about 200 hours of general frustration 200 hours of looting and running from the circle. 50 hours of spotting enemies and deciding wether or not I should engage. about 30 hours of fire fights. 8 hours of waiting for servers to refresh only for the devs to push it back two hours twice same day after promising to give themselves more time so that WOULDN'T HAPPEN. and the rest of the time was either getting shot in the back killed from not being able to hear an enemy between a friend and me while being able to hear my friend foot steps clear as day. I could litterally go on for hours about all the crap this game has. but instead I bid thee fairwell until the game gets fixed in a few years till then i'll play insurgency and bf5,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Unfortunately it is much much much worse than ever before. played 5 games in a row just to get shredded by a hacker hip firing me to death with 0 recoil from like 500 metres away.Honestly if you insist onmilking people with your crates that add absolutely 0 value to the game then make sure there are no way this kind of behaviour can take place in the first place. But since it is clearly too much to ask for you to do something to stop all the hackers over a 4 month period because of the existance of the crates then you don't deserve to have people play the game.The mentality of let's do crates and encourage hacking but not switch it off until we can handle the problem is utterly stupid.

This was a good game it wasnt perfect nor was it a ""gold mine"". I would call it a rough uncut gem that with a little time and effort could be something special. then 1.0 came along and it showed us that even something that could be good no should be good can be run into the ground with bad judgement. Me and my friends spent alot of nights in this game we cryed we cheered we even managed to get a chicken dinner and we cursed alot. oh my did we curse. but it was fun buggy but fun. but as the fame and money came in the problems seemed ignored. people raised an eyebrow at the lootboxes you need to buy keys for the slow decline of cosmetic items of interest unless your shelling out money. this wasnt to say you couldnt get stuff without paying but lets face it how white T shirts and red Vests do you need.We ended up playing for about 2 rounds when 1.0 came along and we quit after that. havent touched it since. The rubber banding on the desert map was so bad it wasnt even funny worse still that i saw on the forum that the play testers had told bluehole this was a problem and it still was pushed for release. i dont know if it was true but considering how bluehole has managed this show i would not be surprised at all. oh sorry not Bluehole i forgot they tryed the ""if we change our name people wont know it was us"" trick. Its the PUBG Corporation now. my bad. all in all im told fortnite is better and we're planning on moving over to that when we can be bothered. look how long it took me to write this. So the good it made battleroyale popular in the mainstream pushed other developers to do something and in one case do it better.I won a chicken dinner solo and we won a chicken dinner in team mode.The bad 1.0 was rushedI ""reviewed"" itif you made it this far why did you read it? im not good at reviews no doubt someones going to complain about format spelling Your still reading....stop. now.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-07-30,0,0,28,False,Not Recommended,A potentially good game ruined by ABYSMAL map design atrocious optimization apathetic developers and some of the worst controls to ever touch an fps. Seriously you have to actively fight the game to get your character to respond to movement in all but the most simple gestures... such as running in a straight line. This game wouldn't be worth a look if it was free much less as a $30 game. I guess elaboration is in order.The map design in this game is unspeakably terrible. The maps are designed specifically to be overly dangerous to traverse and require inhuman spacial awareness to remotely stand a chance of retaliation to an attacker. The random nature of the game is the least of its worries with 3 or even 4 story buildings populating dense cities that reward cheap play and pacivity. The game's optimization or lack thereof is barely worthy of meme status. Anything less than having the game installed on an SSD with the strongest graphics options available will punish the user with low FPS stuttering pop in late loading textures pop in lighting effects and shadows and a game that is a buggy unresponsive mess for the first 2 minutes of the match. The Xbox one version is almost comically terrible and is completely unplayable.PUBG corp does not pay mind to the state of the game unless said state is related to microtransactions.The controls are a joke. This is the Bubsy 3D of FPS this is the Knuckles Chaotix of the modern era. Performing an action more simple than walking on the floor has hideous delay and slow muddy physics. You are not in control you are dragging your character across the map while their feet happen to move by pure coincidence. This is a repeat of Dayz. Don't bother.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-07-31,0,0,1113,False,Not Recommended,I honestly WANT to love this game. I enjoy the Battle Royale concept and this game has the best gunplay out of all the BRs I've tried and tested up to this point. Unfortunately the developers who created this game have a LONG way to go when it comes to optimization community approval and just generally making this game what it has EVERY ability to be.There are quite a few issues plaguing this game in it's current state. The optimization needs an overhaul. Frame drops desync rampant exploitation of known glitches you name it they've got it. I have avoided writing a review on this game up to this point because they were doing better about updating the game weekly and fixing SOME of the optimization issues seen in the past. I really thought the developers were starting to get to a point where they could give the community what the community wanted. Now however the developers have announced that this is the second week we will see no updates.I can't give a recommendation for this game in it's current state and that's unfortunate. When this game DOES work it works very very well. The gameplay and the graphics are great and I enjoy playing the game quite a bit however if you aren't ready to deal with a large amount of cheating/glitching/bugging/crashing don't buy/install this game just yet. Give it time and hope (like I have) that the developers will get their resources together and make this game GREAT.Last thing to toss into this review Many have already mentioned this but it deserves repetition. Bluehole is currently charging $30 for this game. They also have multiple in game crates/keys/cosmetic items that cost money. So you have to ask yourself with how much money they are bringing in from this game HOW have they not dedicated some of that to hiring a team with enough experience to FIX the bugs and FIX the cheating.I honestly hope they make this game more playable and more enjoyable. I'd hate to see this game lose it's potential due to developers being unwilling/unable to fix well known issues. Fingers crossed...,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-02-21,0,0,332,False,Recommended,This game is good and has some brilliant mechanics but lacks in a few areas.First of all I'll go over what I like. This game builds off the classic battle royale concept (devised by player unknown himself back in arma 3) and turns it into a game that is actually really fun.It does this by incorporating a decent amount of customisation the fact that it's easy to get into servers and that the gunplay is really fun. The graphics are ok and effects like blur on your sights are a touch that help build realism. Another thing is that the ballistics of weapons are actually quite realistic eg 5.56 bullets shoot faster than 7.62 but do a little less damage they are also quieter. This close attention to detail can make the difference between a winning shot or a bullet stopping short.Now the bad. So for starters for some people the game will start but will freeze when loading a game. This happened to me but I reinstalled it and it works fine now. Dunno why.Another thing is the.... Below expected level of optimisation that forces some people into using low level graphics settings or downscaling. This isn't really a problem for me as I have a decent pc but if you have a sub 500 laptop then expect to be dropping frames more often that you'd like. A gameplay issue I have found is that the rifles are zeroed to 100m (not sure about the pistols) and this makes accurate short ranged shooting slightly frustrating if you are trying to shoot through small horizontal slits or such.Now the big question pubg or fortnite? Personally i prefer pubg because I prefer more realistic games(it takes around 3 or 4 rifle shots to kill someone) but if you are more of a casual gamer then this might not be for you. That being said lots of casual gamers who play this end up really enjoying it and having a lot of fun.All in all this game takes practice and in order to do well you need patience and mastery of the controls (for example I once died thinking a car was out of fuel but I was really in the wrong seat the change seat control is ctrl + the no. of the seat you want to change to) but once you get used to how it works and start thinking from a more realistic standpoint you enjoy it a lot more than you would otherwise.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I think for winning you should get 2 crates or something so you are actually rewarded. After a while the game does get boring because theres not much variety like Fortnite the devs add new game modes like the new teams of 20 but in Pubg you can only do solo duos or squads unless you go into custom games in which there zombies and teams of 10 for example. Another good way that the devs could make the game more interesting is by adding actual game modes like StoneMountain64 does like shotguns and crossbows only which would give people to play the game again.Before i stopped playing there was asian hackers everywhere me and my friend would get low then started getting headshot by a kar98k without fail after dying we went and watched the replay to see the player locking on to players through objects and shooting them ruining our experience because there's nothing you can do at all.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-02-22,0,0,11,False,Recommended,After the long wait for this game to leave its beta stages I decided it's time to buy this. I have played 5 hrs and still playing. I initially went into this game with a bad taste in my mouth after reading a slew of comments good and bad. I came to the realization years ago that the modding community for online games were going to severly impact my enjoyment that I get from online games like this and GTA V. Playing this game on anything other than Solo without friends is almost unplayable unless you speak forign languages as there is no region locking in place. Once you drop with your team you will most likely be shot on sight by your own team. With that said I enjoy playing this on both my XBOX One X and my PC. It gives me countless hours to yell at my Tv / Monitor. I have always been a fan of tactical games. If I could give any advice in the further development of this game it would be Must have some sort of region locking in place to make it a fair and level playing ground for all of the user base because comunication is key. Put a system in place for bad sport players. If this game is going to use micro transactions for cosmetic atire then adjust the BP to crate price so you dont feel like grinding is to over whelming. Add more choices to the charactor customization so we can feel like we own the charactor for that immersion factor. Overall I would give this game a 3 out of 5 stars. The game is addicting. Hours will pass by and you wont even realize it. The game ddoes an excelent job of roping you in to saying one last match and 10 more go by. I cant wait to see future updates. Hopefully the Devs hear their players and make the changes to the region locking. I feel that will play a huge roll in the life of this game as there will be other games that will come to market with the same premise and if that region locking isn't put into place alot of this games player base will flock to the better choice. With all that said Go Get Those Chickin Dinners!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-02-22,0,0,135,False,Recommended,PUBG is one of my favorite games since its BETA release in 2017. Every fight is differnet and requires quick thinking and being fast on the trigger all the time. I highly recommend this game to anyone looking for a fast paced shooter or people who are looking to improve their skills. I havent ran into these so called Chinese hackers everyone is runing into recently. (or atleast that I have seen). The one problem i am having so far is these new locked crates. I dont play CSGO for that reason because I felt i should have a reward for saving up my points to buy a crate and not have to pay a 2.50 USD paywall for a key to unlock said crate. Of course there are still problems with the devs who seem to add more crates rather than fixing the issuses at hand. My girlfriend love playing together but the problem is that her 970 will barely run the game on low settings. With the game mim requirements stating as of 02/22/2018 say it requires a Geforce 660 or better.Need to fix issuses with lag and mim requirements but fun on a 1060 or better. 8.5/10,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-11-05,0,0,57,True,Recommended,Just got my first Chicken Dinner after close to 40 hours. Don't let all the hacker talk sway you not as bad as they say (or maybe I'm just lucky or haven't seen them who knows). Don't be fooled though getting good takes time patience and learning from your mistakes. Incredibly tense gameplay. Play with headphones!! Everything and I mean EVERYTHING makes a noise and sometimes it can be the difference between life and a frustrating death.All of this said the game is far from perfect. There are a few lag issues especially at the start of matches. All of the guns have a decent learning curve this is not just a point and shoot type of game. You WILL get killed by people you can't see but have a perfect bead on you and there WILL be matches where you spend 20mins getting kitted out only to be sniped by said person mentioned earlier. That is just the type of game this is. It is hard to recommend this game to everyone but this is deffinetly a unique experience that shouldn't be missed.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-07-19,0,0,529,True,Recommended,I've had to change my review since I last posted it in August. This game has gone downhill since then but still remains enjoyable. Hackers are somewhat rampant absolutely aggravating bugs still exist and there are numerous issues with the game in general but I still keep coming back. Why? Because this is hands down the best experience you can have with friends. I never find myself playing solos in this game but the tactical decisions you can make with a few buddies in discord is astonishing. Out of my 226 hours I've currently played maybe 10 of those have been spent on solo games and that was just me dicking around. Solos yield about as much joy as putting a toothpick under your big toenail and kicking a concrete wall but Duos and Squads on the other hand are pure fun to play.One genuine flaw between all game types though is the bugs and server glitches. The better half of the time I don't find myself blaming me for my death and it feels like the server or game cheated me out of surviving. Sometimes the hit detection can be ridiculous and the movement can feel like a clunky mess but here's hoping it gets fixed by the end of this year.Overall I do recommend this game for the sole reason that I've managed to get over 200 hours of enjoyment out of it. I feel like once the actual release hits on December 12th many things will be fixed and it will be a much more enjoyable experience.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-11-06,0,0,37,True,Not Recommended,I was really hoping that when I bought this 3 days ago that some of the problems had been adressed. I was putting off buying it untill I saw noticable improvements in the Steam reviews. Unfortunately I wasted my $30. Granted I've played 9 hours so perhaps I've just had a consistent run of crap luck .Hackers are a problem. When I've got someone's genitals in the barrel of my 12 gauge shotgun and they don't die from the shot that's a problem. I could go on but that would get repetitive.Lag is a problem. I play on the NA servers and while I live out in the middle of nowhere I've never had as much of a problem with lag on any other game as I've had with this game. I would say 80% of my games have had lag issues at some point. For a game that's made so much money you'd think that some of that revenue would have went into improving the basic infrastructure of the game. Especially as the whole thing is dependent on players being able to play against each other.Those are just a couple of issues I have with this game and why I wouldn't recommend it. I'll admit my setup isn't optimal for PUBG (or really most games for that matter) but I've been in massive fleet battles in EVE Online and had less problems than I have had with PUBG. I'll keep trying (in part out of an odd combination of masochism and boredom) but I'm not holding out hope that it'll get better in the near future.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

My computer has an SSD with pubG on it also 16gb ram so if you have that then this game will work fine the SSD and 16gb ram will make dropping anywhere lag free and you wont be dropping fps because itll have loaded before you hit ground Also i have a amd fx6300 and a nvidia GTX 1060 and im pretty sure the gtx 1000 series is most optimized for the game but i could be wrong. After playing for 1.5 2 weeks i can say ive had 1 crash and it was pretty random. but other then that 1 crash i havent dipped below 60 or been ed by preformance. if you do get the game tho i reccomend you have atleast 1 friend to play with because this game is so fun when you play with friends me and my friend always play and mess around then we relise we are like top 10 or 15 and like oh we gotta try. thanks for reading my review upvote pls,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-04-11,0,0,208,False,Not Recommended,"TL DRStay away from this game. Don't get tempted by streamers and promo material the game is far from finished has a myriad of unaddressed bugs since Early Access and provides more frustration than enjoyment. Greene and ""PUBG Corp"" (BlueHole) are unreliable breaking promises and clearly protecting vested interests such as streamers rather than consumers.Definitely not recommended not even if it's on sale.Also the reason for my high amount of gametime despite the negative review I'm playing selling the crates to get my 30 back. After that I'll uninstall it. That is how bad I rate the game.Long versionGame has been released Dec 2017 after 8 months of Early Access together with X box release.It's inconceivable for me as to how such a decision was made. The game is still laughably detrimental to the intended enjoyment it should provide FPS stability and performanceUnstable. Framerate hikes during firefights creating too much variability to adapt and improve. In a game where spotting enemies from far away is key this becomes an important hindrance. Too much style over substance.LootingFrustrating beyond words. Tense situations force you to loot as fast as possible and gain the upperhand but that's incredibly hard when looting feels laggy the item boxes are extremely big causing you to pick up unintended items and arranging attachments on weapons can be a real mess.Additionally I cannot fathom what went through BlueHole's mind to put CLOTHING / GAS CANISTERS as loot in the game. Nobody is interested in those items nobody loots them. They occupy actually useful item slots (such as weapons ammo gear or attachments) and arguably seem more prevalent than the aforementioned utilities. NO ONE loots those things let alone uses them.RNGProbably the keyword for this game pretty much defines the whole experience. You will have cases where you're frantically running through seven buildings to eventually find a P93 (weak handgun) as your only protection against that fully geared guy who's been chasing you with an AR.GameplayExtremely clunky. Movement feels like Arma with a mediocre improvement to gunplay. Your character feels heavy and can sometimes be hard to control (or as desired). The weapon recoil feels solid sometimes overdone (such as the AK). Getting a kill can be very satisfying as that little red personal killfeed can give you a nice dopamine fix after a pumping situation.Driving is questionable and sometimes buggy. It passes as OK however the amount of vehicles is infuriatingly low. There should definitely be more as running to the other side of the map with the blue zone on your heels (literally) is and will always be aggravating.The blue circle of death is incredibly annoying and frustrating. The idea is good and solid but the execution is poor. The game also incentivises camping more than actual run and gunning. Can be tedious at times and will more often than not be boring.Red zone is absolutely horrible mostly depreciated by the community but still present by the infinite wisdom of BlueHole and Greene. Somehow. At times you'll feel like it's specifically hunting you and stifling your progression in the game.NetcodeA veritable travesty to the FPS genre. It's bad. I can't find the word horrible horrendous horrid ish downright atrocious... Just record your game and compare it to the replays based on what the server records. You'll see how laughably BAD it is. 18 Hz tickrate because they can't handle more. This is THE main showstopper without question.Oh be prepared to have non native people playing on your server with high ping. You'll die behind cover and some of your hits will not register (properly). MapOk but monotonous at times. Currently has 2 maps with some mixed feelings about the newest one (Miramar desert map). I feel like there's not enough cover and at times it seems too big.CommunityIf you feel courageous just check the discussions going on there.SecurityIf only there was something resembling it. It seems rampant with cheaters (around 20 of TOP 100 rankings are usually cheaters). With the influx of the Chinese market (making up a vast amount of concurrent players) it becomes even worse. Furthermore people have a reason to cheat the inflated prices of skins on the marketplace and tradeable goods. Another big showstopper for this game.MonetizationNot worth it. No added value and overappreciated by BlueHole causing more focus diverted to cases and skins than actual game optimisation.Developers Questionable practices promised no monetized crates in Early Access but released the Gamescom crate (with the E sports tournament funding as their excuse). Considers the battle royale genre as their own product and brushes competition away. Considered legal actions against the provider of their engine (Epic Games). Made me laugh a bit. Rushed X box release instead of focusing on PC version. Seemingly supported and catered to streamers screaming streamsnipers by banning accused people. Blind and deaf to community suggestions and wishes. Sometimes downright condescending (""I just don't get the attitude of some people"" when some people have been rightfully asking for region locks due to unfair ping advantages. Apparently that comes over as ""racism"".",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-03-07,0,0,526,False,Not Recommended,"This game is a great option for players with patience and a group of friends. It is however an extremely frustrating game to play in it's current build. Progress is being made and the playability has improved since EA and initial release but this is not a finished game. Damage often feels like it's decided via dice roll and gun ""rebalancing"" is a nightmare but my real gripe with the game is the development. Bluehole does what they can but bugs like the lobby not loading deathcam delay poor collision mechanics and framreate dips in cities/towns all add up to make for a clunky game. If you're an NA player expect servers to be down once a week since Bluehole is on KST and frequently runs maintenence around 6 PST. Hacking is still an issue but that's a dead horse at this point and frequently misused to justify a particularly lucky shot or shoddy deathcam.

Every time I get to late game it's been through what's pretty much sheer luck. I think this is because I can't know what killed me. If there was a killcam feature for someone to view their killer's attack it would better help the player understand why they died and even point out a few good sniping spots or whatever furthering their knowledge of the game. As for now I do not like being killed out of nowhere and not knowing who or what killed me and I wouldn't recommend it until that was implemented Solid game though. 5/10,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Only after a few games do those damn playdough houses begin and the game slows almost to a stop but i can at least play for an hour or two before that happens. Gotta give this game a 6/10 because there are still things wrong with it HOWEVER its still in alpha and I have high hopes they can hash these bugs and glitches out sooner rather than later. Good graphics as expected from a UR4 game and thought its not tagged as a horror game playing FPS SOLO on a map that has the deadly trio makes it a Horror for me atleast. Think about it Its dark outside its raining AND its so damn foggy you cant seen 15 steps ahead of you. Love the uneasy feeling it gives.I continue to have an ongoing problem with the game sometime after drop the game will freeze up my PC and the only solution is to hard rest my rig.

I should be able to run this game fine but strangly at random it crashes hard and i get no errors in the previous recovered syst logs. gameplay is awesome when it actually works(9/10) but this problem prevents a good mogirity of that so funtionality is 1/10.Overall id say out of 10 this game's a 4 until that gets fixed.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-03-02,0,0,597,False,Recommended,Honestly a fun game alone or with friends but more so with friends. What kills this game for me is the fact that I can get hit behind cover and third person cheating is so common and blatant. In addition I don t know if it s just me but the cheaters are starting to leak into first person. For a while my friends and I were winning at least once in a PUBG sesh. Now I just die to questionable snapping and accuracy when I or my friends have a clear advantage. Rather than see more content and loot crates added to the game a ping lock and better banning system would benefit the game much more. If you have the patience to lose a game due to desync or a cheater relatively often then get it I still have fun usually.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-10-05,0,0,517,False,Recommended,"Review from positive to negative Adding to the review below cause to be honest I think Iv run out of patients with this game. If your a Dev for this game looking for things worth fixing my ranting list below might be of some use to ye...(TLDR boo urns glitchy lag) No doubt its one of the best games I'v ever played... but only when it works.For something like this to work long term it needs to be stable. This game is anything but stable. The lag makes it unplayable. Try stalking someone waiting for a clean head shot to come all of a sudden they glitch all over the place and they are gone. What's the point of a FPS where the enemies glitch around the screen?It's not my internet connection that's running at 80mbs. It could be theirs but surely a ping limit is necessary for these games or region lock people to reduce latency. But its not just that picking up weapons is extremely slow. Good luck quickly picking up a weapon in the first few seconds of a match (click click click click....click.wtf).... boom! your dead 3 minute waiting time to start again. Well that was a waste of 6 minutes. Frantically running around houses trying to kill someone lets just wait for this insanely slow climbing animation to play.What about that door surely it's a normal door that will open when you tap f. Wait no! This is one of those annoying doors that doesn't open at first so you tap f again. Then it quickly opens and closes. Frustrated you quickly tap f again. Boom! Your dead. All this door activity has been attracting attention. Ladders how are there no ladders in this game? F**k your crate system. ""Rewards"" locked behind a pay wall.... are you serious... give out (non transferable) keys for chicken dinners at the very least you absolute snakes. Saw one or two clips for the PGI that grenade from shroud...... proof that the combat mechanics are completely messed up. That other magic smoke grenade....The death cam I get it's a close match of what really happened.... but this is a computer game that should rely on exact positions. When you see a death cam that doesn't match up to how you saw things happen it makes you very suspicious of what actually did happen. How can the death cam not replicate the exact position of each game object throughout a match? It seems like the ""reality"" of the match is some mishmash of each of the players own experiences.How don't the parachutes work yet....... please wait as I destroy this game object and create a new one on the ground this may take a number of seconds. Why is it not a single player controller that is just slowed down by the parachute press f delete parachute game object player just falls to ground under gravity. You should be able to land on telephone wire if you could be bothered. Scopes are absolutely essential in this game the maps are just too big to not have a scope. Make scopes more common. Its gotten a bit better I feel Sanhok was a step in the right direction wrt guns. Vehicles should be everywhere! Like every corner should have a car put less petrol in them if necessary. It is so so annoying when the circle goes against you and there isn't a vehicle for miles. Finally get a few kills and a good weapon next circle comes and you die after like 5 minutes of running directly to the next one. Or else you take a chance on a town where you would expect to find a car. But no... now your totally screwed no amount of energy drink will bring you back from this one.... but let's waste 10 minutes trying and die to the blue zone anyway.... Level selection why... why why... you know what im taking about. Just why.... Notice a few things I didn't mention. I haven't mentioned the price... 30 bucks is a great deal for this game (when it works fix it and it might even be worth 60). Haven't talked about the types of guns or any radon gun features. I didn't mention the small number of maps. Didn't mention the event modes. Didn't talk about the finer details on the walls of houses or the limited number of building models. Didn't mention the absolute terror of a 1 on 1 encounter with someone in a tiny mountain village. I didn't mention the leader board. Why? Because these things work. Stop working on them like immediately. Sort out the basic game play before a competitor does it first.And possibly most importantly I didn't give out about the Sanhok event pass (I actually think this is a good move). You sell the games make buckets of money buy loads of infrastructure players have a laugh money dries up servers go down sad players. Selling keys to gammy rewards crates is not the way stop this. Sell event passes maybe even make them open competitions if not for really money for exclusive gear? Like the reward you get at the end of the event based on your player rank over that period. Have a wide variety of prizes for completing missions during matches wide variety is key if everyone has the latest prizes no one will want them they need to be varied enough for people to be seeing new thing all the time. Always wondering where did he get that....If your still reading this then im shocked if you agree with my ranting up vote this to show the devs why people are qucikly loosing faith in this game.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-11-11,0,0,557,False,Recommended,Approaching 400 hours and may I say it's been a long journey. From being the first of my friends to recieve the game to now having 6 close friends playing it has been wonderful. If you want to read reviews on how bad the game is scroll elsewhere. Instead of going on about all the bad things about the game I'll tell you about the development and skills of myself and my fellow cohorts. 1. (Myself) aka Skewer The first player out of this group of friends to play the game. Skilled enough in battle. He's grown up to be a fierce warrior. Born from the fires of FPS games. Not the best FPS player but it is his preffered gametype and he excels at most of them. Some might say if he had to choose between Beginner Intermediate Advanced or Hardcore difficulty. He would pick Advanced. Hardcore is for wussies. 2. (Lewi) aka Moneyman aka CuriousMoney He didn't jump into the PC race until last year but he's made a big footprint in the world of PC gaming in the past few months. Some might call him a Rocket League connoiseur but this man can adapt to any playing field if he enjoys the game. Put him in an FPS he gets good at it. Put him in a Strategy game he gets good at it. Hell if you put him in a farming simulator he could somehow do what you do and do it 100 times better. That's just who he is. Not only is he lethal but he has your back 100%. An asset... No! A necessity to the PUBG squadron. 3. (Josh) aka Joshy A skilled warrior in the art of FPS combat. This man carries the background of over 700 hours in Counter Strike and an accompanying 700 hours in Rocket League. He has the reflexes and accuracy of a highly trained sniper. Even though he only has 53 hours in PUBG he is a force to reckon with. Don't let a few beers get to this guy. After he knocks a few finely chosen brewskis down his accuracy goes from 100% to 1000%. Devastating on the playing field and always has your six. 4. (David) aka Flamennight aka Nice Ugly Boy The Dark Souls addict. Almost 500 hours in Dork Souls. He has mastered the art of the sword but what happens when you put a rifle in his hands? Where do we start with him? This guy has always been one to jump into FPS games with me. If I buy a game and I like it this Ugly Boy is down to join me. Quite adaptable to any game really. I wouldn't say FPS games are his #1 but he's got skills. I've had some delicious chicken dinners with this one. Nice boy. Nice ugly boy.5. (Adam) aka AdamWest aka Big G aka Caboose This guy... This guy... This mofo will teamkill you with a grenade and not even blink. He says he's sorry but we all know he doesn't mean it. This dude has 1 700 flippin hours in Total war games! Like who does that?! Anyways... He is not a bad FPS player. Hey I didn't say he was good. Just kidding Big G. He's good at FPS games. In PUBG you need to be a good strategist and G just needs to figure that part out. Don't leave it to him to call the shots. I personally think he has a lot of potential in PUBG. He just has to reach the breaking point. You'll get there someday buddy. Oh and he ALWAYS is the last to leave a location and takes forever to search a building. 6. (Colton) aka The Postman This dude can be a little stubborn. It took him long enough to buy PUBG but he finally did and he really enjoys it. The Postman has a very large palette for video games. He has many hours in the Fallout series but also quite a bit in Garry's Mod Just Cause and Unturned. It's fun to have him in the squad because he enjoys the game no matter what. I'm sitting here getting frustrated when we lose and he finds the fun in it all. Not my first choice to have my back in PUBG but he can get kills when you need him and can get you a laugh at any moment in time. Skilled and fun what else can you ask for? 7. (Dylan) aka Cowbell aka Groot Oh Dylan. Poor poor Dylan. Even though you always get dragged into our silly games you find a way to have a laugh and enjoy yourself. I still don't know if he has a kill yet in PUBG but he only has 27 hours in game so it's alright. Let me tell you something. He is an awesome looter. He is also very appreciative of the vehicles in the game. I have witnessed an amazing thing from him. After three vehicles zoomed past me in game they headed straight for G Ugly Boy and the marvelous Groot. I watched as Groot took on a speeding buggy backwards. He looked away from his attackers. They didn't deserve his final stare. He looked away at death and laughed. It slammed into him... and knocked him down but he took it like a man. Respect for this guy. He'll follow you into to battle and even though he might be the first to die. He died for you.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

There is a terrible chinese playerbase as well they swarm into every regiona and it sees 9 of 10 people are chinese. While I can just play solo an ingore these guys and their terrible gameplay and attitudes it causes another problem. The netcode for this game is so terrible that you have to have a bad ping to play well. Hits are registered client side so being able to kill someone after they react is all too common a majoity of the time I find myself taking cover just to end up dying. Then after watching the kill cam I can see the enemy aiming at thin air and killing me. This is just not fun. There are better games out there.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-04-05,0,0,346,True,Not Recommended,EDIT As of mid October this game has had a surge of cheaters on it using aim bot RPM and movement teleporting. Has made the game unplayable.Let me start off by saying that I have not played any of the battle royale mods from H1Z1 or ARMA. So I came into this game quite new to this format. Previously I was mostly playing The Division but after given no reason to continue playing it this game released on Steam Early Access while I was finding something else to play. Checked out some quick gameplay footage and decided to buy it.Holy was I happy.For an early access game I would say it feels pretty good. FPS can be bad at times even with my i7 6700k/ GTX 1080 Ti 3440x1440 (This game does support ultra wide monitors) but with some of the settings set to low while keeping draw distance at ultra I mostly get 70 FPS but can dip down into the 40s depending on the area.What I love about this game is that it puts everyone on an even playing field and requires you to learn the lay of the land to find the best loot. The enclosing circle keeps people on the move and learning to look all around you becomes rewarding once one becomes accustomed to it. I also love that this game is both First Person and Third Person. Since playing The Division for so long I've grown to love Third Person over First.Some issues that I do have with the game besides the obviously much needed hardware optimization would be the bad grenade throwing mechanic no kill cam to see how you died issues inviting friends some bullet caliber balancing switching between auto run and manual fluidity not being able to get up from prone with shift+w &amp maybe adding some sort of visual size/weight system so players can see what's taking up the most space in their bags.In conclusion if you're looking for a shooter that breaks from the mold of spawn kill capture die respawn then this is it. In my opinion this game is well worth the 30 dollars even if you only put 30 to a hundred hours into this game while waiting for the new summer/fall release of games.Update As of the new month 2 patch I noticed my FPS has gone up significantly and stays consistent at 100 FPS on my system.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Also what is this strange blue force field that traps people into smaller and smaller areas?Edit Fun game but I am thinking of changing my review to neutral only because of the cheaters that I have seen now that they implemented the replay feature. There is also a report feature but it is so lame seeing someone running up a hill has no line of sight but snaps to aim and shoots you. Being able to survive running into a building and hiding to heal the same person comes to top of the hill and around the corner and auto snaps to aim right on me and shoots me while I'm in the corner of a dark room through the window. How would he have seen that I was even there? I have reported many players for this type of cheating but who knows when it will be addressed. It is too popular and don't get me wrong it is a fun game however very annoying watching your death replays and a lot of the time seeing these type of auto aim cheats.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-01-18,0,0,573,False,Not Recommended,"I don't write many reviews but after 515 hours I think I have a bit to say about this game in its current state (January 2018).I've thoroughly enjoyed the game up until recently.The core mechanics of the game allow for a wildly different experience from one round to the next and there's a significant learning curve from where to drop and loot when to move when to fight and what the hell you do when you're in the top 10. The RNG can screw you but after awhile you manage to cope and heck it creates some tense early game moments! Vehicles are ridiculous and fun to drive. The two maps currently in the game play very differently to eachother and they have different vehicles and some different weapons. As a new player the desert map will just be another part of the game but for older players tried and true strategies have been thrown out the window.Now if the issues I'm about to present weren't in the game then I'd recommend the heck out of it. But alas I have to warn buyers to bide their time...No matter what region you play on 50% of your lobby is going to be Chinese players playing from China with ridiculous pings (thanks to the games netcode lag benefits the one causing it). Player Unknown has recently called anyone who wants the game region locked ""xenophobic"". If you try and play team modes with randoms odds are you're matched with Chinese players who either ignore you or act as if you're an imposter it's not very fun.The largest issue I've faced in all my 515 hours has only been happening to me since the game went live (and subsequently Chinese players started filling servers)... Cheaters.The amount of deaths to blatant hackers is too much for a game of this scale with anticheat is t. 480 hours played in alpha so in 35 hours I've experience more cheaters than 480 thanks to whatever the .But no I'm xenophobic because I don't want to die to Chinese hackers.Nothing seems to be being done about this. So the game isn't enjoyable. You either die due to lag or cheats.Oh yeah the Oceanic lobby used to be filled with great banter. Now it's filled with Chinese players who don't know what push to talk is and maybe one or two English speakers telling them to off. lmao.tl dr great game but filled with laggy cheaters atm. avoid until you see gaming news sites reporting on it being fixed.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-04-07,0,0,327,False,Not Recommended,This game is fun. I cannot say that it isn't but there are problems with it that the developer has refused to see too such as the amount of players that pour from China into other servers with ping that is raised due to connecting to a server accross the planet and third party VPNs that further increase this issue. The ping on these players is so bad that you can kill / down them and still take damage even after you get the kill or they are knocked down. It can cause people with usually solid internet connections to lag and rubberband if there are to many people from the other side of the globe. Another reason I can't recommend this game is just how popular it is. It doesn't feel the same as when I bought it almost a year ago and the fact that you can get a LOCKED crate from the rewards where you have to buy the key is ludicrous. Sure you can sell the crates on the marketplace but the price scaling to actually earn a crate isn't worth it with the decreased BP you earn at the end of a match.I used to recommend this game but right now I cannot. You'd be better off playing Fortnite for free.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2018-02-20,0,0,172,False,Recommended,"Product received for free. Mein Kampf One day I was sitting in my chair drinking all the diabetes in the world without a care. It was then that I looked at the TV and saw the news broadcast. It said there were a group of Logangsters breaking into people houses kidnapping them and taking them to an unknown location. Then I heard it. The window smashed as a hoard of 12 year old kids came rushing in. They leaped on my and put what looked like a Tesco shopping bag straight on my head without hesitation. They were savages. They also took my wife and 2 kids. Suddenly the bag was taken off my head and I was on an island where I was greeted by my family but also a bunch of Russians yelling ""China Number One"". I didn't have time to count but there must have been about 100 of 'em all bunched up in groups of fours some more aggressive than others punching other peoples' faces. There were alos a couple of them with stylish yellow jackets and maching tracksuit pants resembling a banana. Without notice we all somehow teleported into the back of a plane where Russians continued to shout things such as ""Drop in Pockinki !!"" The doors at the back of the plane opened and the Russians began leaping out. I knew something wasn't right and then all 4 of us were pushed out above a shooting range (for some reason this shooting range has blackboards and desks in it). When we got close to the ground we all pulled the parachutes and I spotted some people picking up various weapons. I looked at my family in horror and told them to follow me as I rushed down the stairs in search of a gun. I quickly explained what was happening and gave an M16 to my 5 year old son (probabaly not my best idea ever) while I held an S12K in my hand. I looked down the corridor and saw a family of Russians running around with guns looking extremely paranoid. I knew it was inhumane but I had no choice. I shot the youngest he must have been about 8 straight in the head which somehow didn't kill him but he was crawling on his hands and knees shouting for help. His father turned round so I shot at him as well as my son opened fire with his M16. He didn't manage to hit anyone except for his sister who cried out in pain. My wife ran over to help her and like a miracle she was fine again after about 10 seconds. I quickly finished off the rest of the Russian family and checked them for supplies. One of them had a big rucksack that I grabbed with no hesitation and filled it full of various attachments I found in the room. My wife picked up the Kar98k from the body of the father and pulled a scope from her back pocket. She put the scope on the Kar98k making an overpowered killing machine. My daughter managed to scavenge a first aid kit from the next room and healed herself up. We were all ready and all had guns so we ventured out into the unknown. Suddenly some text began to appear in the sky above which read ""RESTRICTING THE PLAY AREA IN 10 SECONDS"". Did they think this was some sort of a game? I had know idea what this meant and so I asked if anyone had a map. In an instant a hologram appeared in front of my eyes and it displayed a white circle a blue circle (which seemed to be moving towards the white one) and a few multicoloured arrows grouped up together. I quickly realised what this meant. I explained that we were the little arrows and the blue circle was the edge of the play zone. I also determined that the white circle must be a safe zone. However when I opened my map again there was a filled in red circle where we all were. I didn't know what it meant so i just told everyone to go towards the white circle. A couple of seconds later bombs began to rain down from the sky the first one striking Jimmy right in the head and the next one killing him for good. My wife began to cry but I knew the same would happen to us if we stopped. We all sprinted as fast as possible until we made it to the white circle weher we spotted what looked like 4 friends in a car. The two in the back were hanging out of the windows trying to aim their guns. I told Sarah and my wife not to shoot as we don't want to give away our position. Before long the text once again appeared in the sky so we were on the run. The blue circle was faster than us this time and consumed us all but we found out that it didn't instantly kill as I though it might. Sarah and I managed to get out alive and she pulled out 2 energy drinks. She gave one to me and we each downed them. We felt ourselves becoming able to withstant more bullets as we continued to run for our lives. We both looked at eachother and were able to tell what eachother were thinking we had to win . When I opened the map again I noticed something I didn't see before and it said ""14 ALIVE"". We were both crouched down behind a rock when gunfire started in our direction. We got behind the other side of the rock and I peeked my head out. It was then that I spotted them. I opened fire my first 5 bullets missing before I landed a headshot on one of the three people. Sarah followed in my footsteps as she took aim and fired straight at another one of them who was wearing one of those yellow outfits. The third one stood no chance as he tried to revive his downed teammate before the outside of the play area engulfed him. I looked again at my map and this time it said ""8 ALIVE"". I decided it would be a better idea to hide until there were left people but Sarah argued otherwise. She ran to a nearby tree but on her way she was struck down by a sniper who then proceeded to finish her off. Now there were only 5 alive one of them being me. Gunshots rang out and I watched as 3 hopeless people of varying ages were shot down. It was then that I realised it was just me and one other person alive. I knew where he was due to him shooting those people so I watched intensely at the wall that the bullets came from. Struck by surprise the edge of the play area rushed past me and I began to feel very ill. I had no way of healing now I just had to take the fight. I watched as he ran from his hiding place clearly trying to draw bullets from me to compromise my position. But I was smarter. I flanked round the right side and threw a grenade where I was before while he was turned round. He instantly turned to the explosion when I jumped out of the bust and sprayed in his direction. However in my panic I only landed 1 shot and now he knew where I was. I crouched behind a tree and peeked in his direction when he fire a bullet straight past my head. I noticed however that he was wielding a bolt action sniper so decided to use this to my advantage. I peeked again to draw a shot then lined up a shot right at his head. He died in an instant and a hologram appeared in front of me and it said ""WINNER WINNER CHICKEN DINNER"" along with ""6 KILLS"". Suddenly Logan Paul began to fly down from the sky like an angel and said ""Well done on beating my little game here I hope you enjoyed. Be sure to get ready for the next one I set up many of these games and I will be taking the winner or winners from each one and make them battle it out to be the ultimate champion."" I couldn't bear it so I took out my gun and swiftly shot Logan in the head and soon after myself.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-02-20,0,0,162,False,Recommended,"OK here is my story called ""Caught in The Zone""By TheRealistOne Today was the day. Me and my comrades gh0st and stink were set a mission. The mission seemed simple. All we had to do was kill 97 other people on an island as we fight to be victorious. However in the briefing they said that we weren't allowed to bring any weapons and that we had to scavange for our own supplies and weapons. Even something as simple as a pan could kill someone. We were all ready. We were transported to a deserted island in the middle of Russia. We had 1 minute to get our senses together and come up with a plan. Stink said that we should go to a place called Rozhok. We all agreed. Then like magic all 100 of us were put on to a plane. Some of the people on that plane were insane. Screaming the N word or yelling things about China. All I had on my mmind was to get the mission done and be victorious. The doors to the back of the plane swung open and people began jumping out like cereal being poured into a bowl. (Kelloggs sponser me pls) We then said our prayers as we passed over Rozhok. 1 by 1 we all jumped out. as we were freefalling gh0st was dabbing. we came close to Rozhok and pulled our parachutes. We all landed but we were all at different sides of the town. I ran into a 2 story house and found a AKM on the floor with some 7.62 lying on the floor. I grabbed both and loaded my weapon. I switched my gun into fully automatic and charged upstairs hoping to find some more supplies. All I was able to find upstairs was a pan. What was i going to do with a pan? Make an egg? Well I wasn't aware of the power of the sacred device known as the pan. I jumped out of the window and ran to another house. Then someone fired at me. I turned around and returned fire. I was shocked as i didn't know how i wasn't injured in anyway. Then it clicked in my brain. The pan saved my life. i ran back out wielding the pan deflecting all of the guys shots. I then got in range and smacked him around the head with it. I didn't believe it. I just killed a man who had an AR with a pan...He turned into a brown crate which had a M416 with some 5.56 ammunition. We scavanged around for a bit until we had filled our backpacks with medication ammunition and weapons. We all grouped together as it was announced that the blue zone was going to shrink soon. As we were together a blue dacia with one guy in it came straight towards us. We all evaded it apart from stink who was hit. He started crawling towards us. As he crawled to us gh0st fired his beloved Kar98k at the dacia taking out 1 of the wheels. The car spun out. The driver got out and began to fire back at us. Well mainly towards stink. We both looked at him. He was defenceless and couldn't do anything. stink looked at as and told us to go. Then the fatal blow that punctured his skull killed him. We had to go. Me and gh0st found a Motorbike parked on the side of the road and headed towards it. We both got on it and left Rozhok. When we were driving around we noticed the plane flying by. It dropped of a crate. A supply crate.""Look we need to be the first one their!"" I yelled. gh0st went as fast as he could but it was too late. When we got there there were multiple enemies fighting. Often stopping to drink a energy drink or eat some painkillers. We both layed down in a bush. I glanced over my right shoulder and noticed something unusual. There was a bush next to us with another man laying down in it. He was wearing a ghille suit and had acquired a M24 with a suppressor on the end of it to muffle his shots. I told gh0st. I then snuck up behind him. Pulled out my sacred pan and hit him over the head. Instantly killing him. I grabbed his M24 and the ghille suit. We then thought it would be good to leave the area. Maybe they would drop another one? As we drove around we were told that only 15 people were alive. This was including us. We checked our electronic map and saw that the blue zone had came in a lot and that the circle was starting to become very small. It looked like the circle was going to close in on a place called Mylta Power. So we headed towards it. We thought if we were the first one there we would have a higher chance of winning. Then disaster stuck. As we were off roading on the bike gh0st decided to do a flip on the bike. At this moment we were racing the blue zone as we didn't want to get stuck in it. Mid flip gh0st said to me over the comms ""I don't think we are going to land it.""And he was right. We landed directly on our head knocking us off of the the bike. The bike exploded as it bounced of the earth. Gh0st was down but not out. I was severely injured. I was forced into using my medkit to get back to normal. Then I noticed the blue zone coming in. Gh0st was laying in a field with the blue zone heading straight towards him. There was no way I was going to get him. Like stink gh0st said to go. The zone then engulfed him instantly draining the life out of him. I had loads of pressure on me. I had to move on. It was intense only 5 other people were alive. (Including me) I was laying in a bush as it made it harder to spot me. I noticed a 2 women running in a field together. 1 was wielding a M249 and the other had a pistol with a suppressor on it. I held my breath and took the shot. I took down 1 of the 2 people. Luckily I had a suppressor which made it harder for her teamate to try and triangulate my location. I took another shot Instanly killing her. Both of them had been killed. That meant that only 2 more people were alive. I had to move as the circle was not in my favour. When the time was right I darted across a field. However I attracted to much attention as I was starting to get shot at. I was so screwed. I was able to get behind a tree. I heard 2 people shooting at me. It was a 2v1. I didn't know what to do I was running low on ammo.I had to use the remaining amount of ammo I had left even if it wasn't a lot. I leaned around the tree and was shot down straight in the face breaking my helmet. I was badly injured. I had nothing to heal up with. This was it. I was sweating profusely. I had to take another shot. I leaned around again and was shot down. I was killed there... All my friends were mad at me. We then exited to the menu and instantly queued for another game. We then won that game.The End",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-27,0,0,1129,False,Recommended,Truly amazing game with excellent developers. By far one of the most exciting and adrenaline pumping games I have ever played. Find a few buddies who play squad up and get yourself a win. 10/10 would reccomend this game to anyone I know.On the more technical issues I am still impressed with this for being an early access game. Devs may not always stick to their original schedules for updates but they never fail to impress when they do come out a few days late. It does require a halfway decent computer to run it on medium settings and totally potato computers can handle the lowest settings at a decent framerate.Edit 1 Still enjoying the game much happier now that they have ping priority matchmaking. I still wish that they would region lock china but it is much better than before. Cheaters are still little bastards but again the ping priority helps a lot. Without having terrible cheaters all the time it makes it a lot easier to win games. I won 3 in a row last night with only one cheater that our squad ran into. Definitely still a work in progress but the devs do keep pushing out updates which I approve of greatly.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

And please use a better anti cheat system because in the oceanic servers today (21/01/2018) i played for about 5 hours and in every single game i died to a hacker who was on the otherside of a map and could see me through walls and hills.Please bluehole and other devs continue to work on the game your deal with XBOX was a mistake you should have purely focused on fixing the PC version before porting it to any type of console it just cant run on the low powered systems like most games should.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

(if you didn't catch that that was sarcasm). The cheating is blantant obvious frequent and have deeply impacted the game that has made me a person who bought the game to enjoy it with my friends at first but now have decided to stop playing.During my short 40 hours of play accumulated through a month of owning the game I have met so many hackers that I lost count and all my report seems to not do anything.And don't waste your time screaming REGION LOCK CHINA. I know it is one of the best solution but BlueHole will never listen and would never do such a thing to hurt their revenue. So the best course of action right now is to stop playing this game for good because honestly you will not enjoy it any further anyway and wait until a better company a company that sees the complete and utter destruction of BlueHole to do a better job at the formula. To BlueHole we gave you many chances and a very long time because I have heard and seen cheating through Youtube and Twitch ever since the game was in Beta almost 2 years ago and you have done next to NOTHING to remedy the situation. And if you go screaming ""You're racist! You just hate Chinese people!"" let me tell you snakes one thing ""Not 100% Chinese players hack but 99 99% of hackers are Chinese""Let the Chinese deal with the Chinese let them fix their own mess not SEA or EU or NA or SA or JP or any other people.Screw off Steam or maybe you can ask Valve to teach you how to do Anti cheat.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-02-06,0,0,38,False,Not Recommended,"So a friend suggested I try this game out and I have to be up front I suck at shooter games and I have really tried with this one but you spend the entire game looking for loot or if all you do 24 7 is play this game you jump right to the good stuff camp and snipe your way to the end game. This is not for the casual player. On another note one can tell the age group of those playing by observing what goes on in the start up que. First 90% of the toons are female and naked (really) Second Half of the population is running around punching each other in the well for 10% the Johnson and for the other 90% the snatch. And all his Beta testing fun can be had for 30 bucks and a wing and a prayer that the friging game does not crash. One more thing to know if you don't get a scope quickly your chance of hitting anything 10 feet plus away is next to nothing and those who know where the scopes are will stand in the open while you miss and headshot the out of you. I have logged a few hours since I first reviewed the game and I still want my thirty bucks back. That said it is addictive and fun to play right up to that point when you get killed by someone who was camping outside the circle (In the blue zone) much longer than possible or be tracked while out of line of sight (checking the DEATH CAM) in a ditch or behind a hill only to have some dog eatting cheater come up right where you moved to. The way I see it is PUBG should stop throwing money into cheat detection and go two ways 1. set up an alias web page like ""YOUTAKEIUPTHEARSEIFYOUCHEAT.COM"" and sell a cheat that claims to out cheat all the other POS cheats they buy it for oh THIRTY BUCKS download it and when they activate it a message pop's up and says ""you have a small Nixon and you are banned for life from PUBG cheater"" BAM that's thirty for the game and thirty for the cheat sixty bucks and it might discourage the cheaters. Or option two create bots that can be dropped into the game and detect anomalies within the Current player base track and record and if they are cheating execute them on the spot or show their positon on the map and the hud of everyone in game with the bot right up in their face wearing all orange no ban needed the fun of jacking with everyone would be over and they would either play honest or go away. I guess there is an option three put all the cheats in the game it takes away the incentive to make them ($) and the advantage to those idiots who pay to use them.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-20,0,0,1279,True,Not Recommended,As someone who plays this game daily I can tell you this game is ok. The amount of issues that plague it become ever so apparent the longer you play it are not ok. There are tons of issues that can be easily solved (like no.1)1. items spawn weirdlyspawn everything needed in the waiting rooms so the server doesnt get overloaded when people spam the server for requests to pick up items only to have them fail. so what if waiting times are a bit longer. other games do it just fine *cough fortnite cough*stuff that is super important but harder to fix 2. bullets/projectiles dont registershotguns either one shot or do nothing at all. bullets either hit or do nothing. grenades fling you to the side and you die from hitting terrain3. terrain clipping/ building clippingyour character can get stuck on by in under and through terrain vehicles buildings4. vehicle physicsclips with terrain and spazzes out. sometimes makes no noise. gets stuck in terrain and explodes or flies off5. game crashesfatal error game stops responding ui refuses to render6. matchmaking on uistops working a lot7.rubberbanding (may be due to anticheat and how it positionally tracks players)game will teleport you back over and over and over at the beginning and sometimes slightly later on. server dependant as I've found a small percentage of servers I have played on have had little to none of this occur. interesting enough when erangel is played and less than 80 people play it there is little to no rubberbanding occuring8.cheatingone in every (I'd say) 10 15 games will have a very obvious cheater. whether they're using speed aim or other cheats they use them constantly. (you'd think with anticheat they wouldnt have the ability to do it but uh.... i dunno you figure it out)There's probably a ton more issues maybe I've forgotten some maybe I havent experienced them yet but for a game this popular its a shame to see something that could be more popular than any AAA game become ruined by things other devs seem to have a handle on. So yes even tho I still play this game lately it has been less and less because everyone I know has become even more and more frustrated with it.

Also their aproach to countering the AFK killers is of monumental stupidity when theres a much simpler and easier fix to that problem for example. if they d remove the force jump from the plane at the end of the map and simply kill players after 1 warning to vacate the plane kill them on the plane. period. see!? a simple fix to the AFK killers at map start. and I m no ing genious either so what does that make bluehole developpers for missing such an OBVISOUS solution to that issue.. as for the lag here s another very simple fix. How about limitting players to their own country s servers?? except of course for the opened OC servers. but asians should only be able to connect to asian servers and vice versa for north americans and etc for the other contries?? so I m forced to question the reasoning skills of the developpers on those issues.

Can't complain about money grabs and bugs as they are trying to listen or atleast show it. The Game is only improving. The fun in beating or outlasting 99 players is great also knowing you dominated many Winning is a rewarding feeling.But a game that can be fun for hundered of hours with only a portion of winning games is a greater achievment.Unlike other E sports it can put on a great show for everyone even players who have no grasp of the game. Pubg corp really is driving to only go further and further with this E sport and i love it.My only complaint is that after the ping based matchmaking update In my region (Oceania) a fix for the local players in other countries around Australia joining and increasing server tickrates. Also many other updates which greatly improved the servers. The matchmaking has become long probable due to small playerbase here in Australia so when queing for First person perspective(FPP) my prefered style the only way to find a game is que in squads which can still take a minute. TPP games can be found but its no where near as fun.My other option is to switch to South East Asian servers which can be 50 ping higher at some times so slightly noticable beside when i die ),PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Until something is done to fix the server issues I'm afraid I won't be playing much it isn't worth the aggravation. And those are only a few problems with the massive Asian player influx. I don't know about you all but I don't speak any Asian languages so teaming up in a squad is impossible. There is a simple solution to these sever problems and im not calling for a China ban just a ping lock on the servers that would go a long way to remedy some of the issues.

I understand it needs to be part of it and I won't let it sway my opinion. They've come a long way since I started playing PUBG. A new map new mechanics weapons bugfixes etc. etc. They've come much further than other devs. Not without mistakes mind you such as the streamsniping banwave etc. but that's expected. It happens we make mistakes and move on.The gameplay has become a lot more reliable. Less and less am I being trapped in random objects unable to detatch my parachute flung from houses instantly killed. I like the direction it has gone in and the developers work to improvce the game where possible.It's enjoyable and the RNG means it's addictive. You don't know how each round will go. Once you've got decent loot you have a chance to show your skills and capabilities it's not all just RNG. There's one thing that they still haven't 100% fixed and that will be because it's not an easy mechanic to just ""fix"" and that's vehicles. I'm still being flung around flipping over 8 times from a small bump at 20 KM/h etc. All in all it's good fun has variance but there is still room to improve.

2018-01-04,0,0,94,False,Recommended,PUBG is a very good multiplayer game that puts you against 99 other players on a giant map full of loot where your only goal is to be the last man standing. You can also play with up to 3 other teammates in first person or third person perspective.The dev that came up with the idea PLAYER UNKNOWN definetely knows what he's doing since he worked on many other ARMA Battle Royale mods so this is a plus for the game since the dev is experienced.Pros easy to learn hard to master endless replayability entertaining gameplay huge map good graphics the level or realism is very high lots of guns attachments healing items etc. has cars you can play with friends very good game mechanics (e.g. leaning right or left ADS crouching proneing) can make money out of crates or items from that crates by selling themCons lots of bugs (e.g. dying when exiting a vehicle cars flipping like crazy shots not registering) cheaters voice chat spammers in the planeOverall it's the best Battle Royale game in my opinion.

2017-09-13,0,0,94,False,Not Recommended,A game people are extremely divided on.The truth is it can be a very enjoyable game but only if you forgive the issues and come to terms with the gamble you have to make each time you queue up. It's very possible to spend nearly an hour at this game and not get back anything that resembles a good time. It's also possible you'll take part in a kickass operation and as your last surviving opponent tries to escape on a motorcycle you tag them in the back of the head from half a kilometer away. There is a certain 'Rainbow Six'esque feeling when you and your friends formulate strategies like flushing out a building with grenades while they cover exits.This game is not without its flaws. Optimization/performance issues mean most people won't be able to run it at a framerate high enough to justify 'competitive' play let alone stream it. RNG dominates the early game and maintains a strong hold all the way throughout to the late game. The difference between a Red Dot and an 8x alone becomes very apparent anytime a blue circle forces you through a long flat open field with high visibility and no cover.The addition of killcam may resolve hacking to some extent but the current state of affairs is that hackers can project their arms through walls and geometry from any distance looking a bit like Stretch Armstrong before auto aiming your face. As you might imagine that's not a very good time when it happens.In my opinion the key to enjoying this game is to treat it as an experience rather than a competitive game. Would recommend moreso on sale because there's not a lot of content at the current price. There is also no denying how poorly developed this game is.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-12,0,0,764,True,Not Recommended,This game is loads of fun adding a mix of survival and shooter. With Blueholes success and implementation of FPS only this game shows promise. Don't let that fool you though. This game is early acces so you will encounter bugs. I only hope that Bluehole decides to spend their money on increasing the team to add more quality to it. I'll go through a list of cons and pros Cons Registration of enitites. The game has a few things which are sometimes fun sometimes annoying. Like people getting stuck in doors people being able to see through entire houses. The game is far from polished in this sense. Hitting play and nothing happens. You need to remake team and refresh to play. This is a very minor con but it does make the game feel less polished. Car collision is a dangerous thing to play with albeit extremely fun and it really takes you back to old days of gaming seeing bugs like this. Initial lag. Whenever you drop down you have lag it can be hard to open doors for the first 5 10 seconds. This is a minor bug if you ask me.Pros Fun Gameplay! Graphics are okay. Immersion is really good. A good dynamic between an intense and chill game as you will often loot for a few minutes and then fight.A final word on the entire microtransaction thing. It seems that Bluehole wants to have a microtransaction system like that of CS GO which is very understandable giving it's success in terms of sales. I've always hated these things I've never been much for skins and stuff that are 'irrelevant' to the core game but which requires money to acquire. Because the money spend on producing these things are time taking away from creating a greater game. It's a sad trend to see gaming industries relying on people and mostly kids when these money machines basically are slot machines. It's gambling and it's combined with an addictive product. There should be laws about these things. READ THIS FOR AFTER THOUGHTS So I've played the game for a few months. I no longer recommend this game to anyone. Sure some of the above is still true. But after PUBG's success you expect to see more improvements. This is just another cash grab game it seems to me. Game gets increasingly more bugs without the core ones getting fixed such as misalignment of scopes. Recoil animation differing from actual recoil making it impossible to learn to spray. Desync. Decent rig. Laggy game. Even though it looks like it was produced in 2005. Sound bug. You hear sounds where they are not. Not cool in a Battle Royale game. Picking up items in the early game is still slow as and requires the patience of a buddhist monk.Buy it for cheap thrills but don't ever expect a polished or finished game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Had zero clue what this game was about or what I was doing. Loaded my first solo match. Checked buttons so see what I could do. Landed and ran around trying to find things to loot. Died to a punch to the head. Time wasted 5 minutesLoaded a second match. Checked buttons again to see if I could find an edge. Landed and ran around trying to find things to loot. Died to a headshot from a pistol. Time wasted 5 minutesRefunded the game.Repurchased the game after I watched some videos and talked to some friends about what to do and what I was doing wrong.Loaded a team match with some friends. Landed and started looting. Continued to loot. Still looting but running too. Running more. See a guy. Run more. Hear a car. Stop running. Car comes over the ridge. Team shoots car. People die. Loot more. Take car because running sucks. Heart pounding to the end.It's a of a game. Be prepared to suffer early and often. But damn is it fun.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-24,0,0,100,True,Not Recommended,The most popular game on Steam right now is a total waste of money. The game is broken full of horrific hit reg and glitchy gameplay tons of bugs and lag. On top of that the overall game requires you to have an incredibly high end PC to play it even somewhat decently. If you don't you'll encounter nothing but dropped frame rates and rubber banding. Moving on to the player base players play incredibly cautious to the point of being campy. In fact most games you will die to someone who is camping or playing super cowardly as this game rewards players to play that way. This game has fun moments but most moments are frustrating and unenjoyable. Don't buy this game while it's in early access. Don't support this garbage company as the more support they get the less they'll try and update it. I've never been so disappointed with a game's potential in my life.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-11-23,0,0,378,True,Recommended,"Player Unknown's BattleGrounds (or PUBG) is a phenomenal game for anyone who loves first/ third person shooters. If you can use a mouse and keyboard to shoot other players and you like the idea of ""The Hunger Games"" then this is the game for you. There are plenty of weapons and locations to keep one entertained for a couple hours. The game is even better with friends.But just like everything PUBG has it's flaws. One the game is demanding on your system. If you have a MAC book or Laptop this game will run like sh*t even on the lowest settings. Two the servers are very unreliable (in my experience). Connections can cut out at critical moments or at the start of a round (again in my experience). Three for some odd reason the servers tend to get swapped. One moment you think you're hopping onto a North America server the next thing you know some guy is yelling at you in Chinese. In a game like PUBG this can be annoying as it makes communication and focus EXTREMELY difficult.Overall though it is good. I find that a 100 person deathmatch can be rather enoyable after a long day at school/ work.

2017-09-13,0,0,126,False,Not Recommended,I was banned from Pubg on March 5 2018. It came up under a steam notification. I am assuming from team killing. Myself and 2 other friends were dropping in locations that we thought people were not going to find us and had fire fights with each other as more of a TDM instead of playing the battle royale. Why I am banned really is beyond me because we were not cheating by any means and just having friendly fun against each other without involving other players. Maybe if you guys allowed custom servers for everyone instead of just Streamers things would be different. I am saddened by your actions against my account and wouldn't of wasted 30 dollars on this game knowing that if i wanted to play a game with my friends the way we want to sometimes this would be the result.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

To keep coming back even after some of the bugs encountered says a lot.But for right now I wouldn't recommend it because the hacking/cheating is absolutely rampant. Doesn't seem to matter which server/region you go on anymore (haven't tried the FPP servers yet hear they're a bit better).

2017-10-12,0,0,623,True,Not Recommended,I started playing this game fairly early and while it had issues They were forgivable. Things like texture glitches and occasonally an inventory glitch but not enough to take away from the experience. As they fixed the early issues and the popularity grew the quality of gameplay has declined severely. I cant get through a single game without network lagging at least once. The speed of server communication in this game is laughable. I have died behind cover more times than I can count and it's infuriating. To me it shows the devs have made their profit and are using their early access staus to excuse glaring faults with their servers. Until they significantly raise the tickrate (both up and down) this game will continue to be a joke. In N. America servers the problem gets so bad I can have a smoother experience on the Asiatic servers.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The only feeling I am left with is that the developers have no interest in fixing this game but only want to milk the money cow. Teasing a massively improved movement system and then not releasing for (I don't know) how many months while adding new vanity items and crates. That ain't right.

But there are some cons that outweigh the pros.(Also a friend did buy this game for me to test it out.)For instance picking up a VSS and getting a few headshots on a player doesn't quite do the trick when the person you're shooting at takes a couple of pot shots and takes you down instead. Now I understand that the VSS from what I have been told is a fairly weak sniper. I get that but headshots should deal sufficient damage if not take the player down after four or so hits. The armor rating based on levels is good I do like the fact that a higher teir(Level) equals more armor but... the frying pan is the save all beat all weapon. The people I have played with have said that the frying pan is OP and have shown me that it can stop bullets... multiple bullets.

2018-02-19,0,0,769,False,Not Recommended,Hackers everywhere poor netcode optimization and in general mediocre in almost every way.I have put in the most hours into this game than any others and that's because when it works it's amazing. Great concept with a very addictive game style. However it never felt polished even after the 1.0 release. Though the 1.0 release was monumental in fixing bugs adding features and bringing us a new map. It still did not address some core issues.Gameplay Wow this is a fun game. However the main issue I see right now that they have 100% control over is the consistent action within game. There are typically two styles jump to a popular location to get top loot or jump to a random location and hope for decent loot. Within 5 minutes you will loose half the people due to these two very different styles. From minutes 5 20 you are really just traveling looting and very infrequently fighting. It's boring. Then comes minutes 20 30 where it picks up again and is truly the most fun. Heart racing and incredibly tense as you vie for the best strategic location as the world closes in around you.Hacking This is where I just couldn't play anymore. I have numerous replays that I have gone through to watch the person kill me by following my every move within buildings behind walls around mountanous areas and just everywhere. Then instantly kill me the second I pop up. Even shooting at me before and just hitting the wall. Everything fun about the gameplay is taken away when you spend 20 minutes building up your characters buildout to just get headshot by a hacker. The last night I played it was three games in a row and I just couldn't take it anymore. Uninstalled right away.Other problems Sound is just terrible nothing like going deaf while flying in the plane driving in a car and being around the red zone. Then having to listen intently to hear footsteps....it is just sad. Loot is very finicky when you first land especially if you jump right away it will not be there when you initially go through a location then the person behind you will find all the weapons that spawned just after. Game still crashes randomly no idea why. Just does.....the list goes on and on and I am sure it's talked about a lot in other reviews forums and anywhere you see PUBG being talked about.Overall awesome game with just the worst execution for a team that clearly has made a TON of money. Resources should not be an issue with making this more playable.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

It's something I enjoy playing with friends for sure. I say yes to buying it.. but I am being very very cautious about the decision.

Ever since 1.0 there was a serious lack of communication updates and new content. It feels like the devs have hit and run. Don't get me started on the new emote system... That can right off. It took them 3 months to get a roadmap out. Not even a roadmap really more like a ""this is what we WANT to do. thats it. bye."" Doesn't feel right. Bluehole you have done next to nothing to fix your stupid cheater plagued game. First Review Damnit I love this game.It has its problems. The game still crashes sometimes. Sometimes it feels like the netcode is wonky.But once all that is shoved to the side you have an excellent game with a rush like no other.

2018-02-17,0,0,872,False,Recommended,**ORIGINAL** Constant cheating even still in mid february. Easy to tell when you watch replays that half the players can see through walls because they are only ever looking the the EXACT direction of enemies. And not to mention when you're level 3 vest and helmet get melted from 500+ yards away in just a few seconds. Some cheaters have even gotten to the point where they auto aim for the chest so that it's more difficult to get caught by the system and guess what IT'S WORKING. They are all over the place. Multiple games in a row. Multiple cheaters IN ONE GAME. And easily verifiable. And those are only the ones that I run into. At this point my strategy has been to listen to shots and watch the kill feed. If they're going down instantly to the same guy over and over I've literally have to just run away. No fun and blue hole are making it so easy for them. 500+ hours and lots of fun in the past but I'm putting this game away until something noticable changes.**UPDATED** better on the cheating but it comes in waves.

2017-07-09,0,0,396,False,Not Recommended,Welp as someone who was a massive fan of this game as the ARMA 3 mod. This standalone version is a heaping pile of garbage.With the amount of money they've made on this there is so much more work that needs to be done that while the game is playable the hit physics hacking and server lag just make me want to play elsewhere. I was hoping by now the developers would have started to address some of the fundamental issues the game has but alas they would rather focus on new even more buggy content instead of tighting up the core functionality of the game. Almost 2 years in and it's still rough around the edges and feels Beta. Even other Beta games have more polish. Do yourself a favour and buy Escape from Tarkov instead!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-29,0,0,126,True,Not Recommended,* UPDATE *The review below still stands but there has been a multitude of additional bugs that have made this game a little bit harder to like. You have been warned.This game is probably the most fun I've had with a loot n' shoot type game in a while. There are quite a few positive notes to be had about this game but there is also the equally as many negative sides. The biggest issue that most people will see right away is the controversy involving streamers stream sniping and subsequent banning.While that is a very awkward subject to reach common ground on it is something to be aware of before you buy this game. Besides that there are just minor issues that rear their head once in a while but when they all are cataloged and added up it shows that this game is definitely still in need of a fair chunk of work before I could 100% recommend it.However the positive sides of this game are amazing. The intense firefights the constant decision making required and a little bit of luck all go into making this game something I will gladly put 100's of more hours into.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The developers are not fixing the issue either and users that have broken the terms of service are suffering no punishments for their actions.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2018-02-19,0,0,173,False,Recommended,This game is my first ever attempt at Battle Royale. Initially I hated the concept but after I tried PUBG it changed my mind about this genre. I have grown to like it.As far as map size goes this game is awesome. You can play the same map over and over again and you'll always discover something new a new location a good hideout or a nice spot for long distance sniping.Gameplay can be clunky at times especially the running/crouching and jumping over obstacles but it's not game breaking. However I sincerely hope that devs will improve movement over time especially landing with parachutes as it's glitchy and you can get stuck on invisible barriers around buildings.Aiming/shooting is very well done but scopes are very hard to master since some of them have inaccurate zeroing distance.Vehicles are well done they provide very low armor (which is realistic) and you can't bunker yourself in a van vehicles are merely necessary for quick transport between A and B good for a quick resource gathering trip to those high yielding drop spots. It's also very noisy which is making you a moving target practice for any listeners out there.This game provides good diversity of gameplay. You can totally be a crossbow Rambo type or a sneaky silenced SKS assassin. Either way you will find the game highly enjoyable.Now the concept of a shrinking zone is VERY annoying. I must say this is the only part of this genre that I have absolute conflict with. I understand why it is necessary to get the group closer together for a good shootout endgame but I think that zone could have been done much better.First of all it shrinks WAY too fast and the countdown timers are too short. I believe they should make the countdowns 5 00 for each phase. The endgame is the least fun part of the game. You're bunched up with 5 10 people in a very small area and you can't even utilize cover if the zone ends up being in the middle of the field.I believe the zone needs some serious improvement. I also hope that devs will introduce more maps with diverse weather in the near future. All in all I'd recommend this game I got it at full price and I don't think it's worth $30.00 at the moment but if they add new maps/weapons and improve the zone I'd say it would be worth even more than that.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Don't get me wrong I still find it a lot of fun. I will say though not as much fun as I used to. I like the new map I really do but I seem to get it 4/5 games and its really annoying because I like the old map too. The new map has so much land mass and is so spread out I often find myself seeing a few players right after stepping out of the herc and then no players again until under the top 20. The map is good and I like the design of it but it's just too spread out and even starting with 100 people I still find it boring unless your run at every shot you hear. Can't wait for a AAA game dev to make a battle royal. So many early access and unfinished games being released at the moment it will be nice to see a polished complete product.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I would recommend this game to everyone. The developers continue to add more content tweak the code and make the game more well rounded.

2017-10-08,0,0,1112,True,Recommended,This is abosolutely an amazing game by far one of my new all time favorites. This game feels extremely balanced and fair and every match feels like im in a different movie every time. This game is going to get your heart pumping hunting down llittle enemies like animals or being chased down by a some kids with 8x scopes it's all engaging and win or lose my satisfaction seems to be high. For example me and a friend duo'd in a foggy match and we ended up getting into the top ten. We ended up having enough supplies and armor to hold down an area and we picked a top point upon a ridge and we stayed prone...and we waited. Covered by grass behind a tree on this point we began to see movement nearby so we moved prone and my God. The atmosphere the shots firing around you nobody sees you but you see them. It felt like I was playing 'All Ghillied Up' from CoD 4 and it brought back so many memories. This game is all run and gun tactics run for your life or be the last man standing in a small house. Don't hesitate to buy this game for an Early Access it really blows my mind. If you're complaining that you keep dying instantly every game because of other kids suiting up quick then my suggestion is to stop complaining because you're dropping next to squads. Move off grid find some quiet areas gear up move quickly but slowly keep your guard up and understand that you have an environment to work with. You don't have to kill everyone you see either just move. I have had no experience with the streamers ban thing but those streamers. This game is most fun with friends but i do recommend playing alone if you want to truly progress your skill instead of relying on your girlfriends to get you that chicken dinner.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

They add vaulting which took them 3 months to make then whilst they do that they ing made the desert map. Nobody asked for that god awful map. I'm starting to get used to it but once you actually look at it it makes no sense on why its been made. Nobody asked for it its ing spanish most people in Korea never even experience desert in Korea like even went to one in Korea. What would've made more sense is to add another russian map that was snowy. You know something they have in Korea and that they can relate too. Another thing is the RNG you can land in po i get a 1911 and a shotgun and then somekid already has a lvl 3 helmet vest backpack with an m4 and a kar. Which is so stupid I'm not saying RNG should not be a thing BUT LEVEL IT OUT FOR GOD ING SAKES. And especially how you can hit someone in the head and it will count as a body shot for some reason. You can hit somebody in the head 3 times with no helmet but they can one shot you with a scar no problem like your some ing chihuaha. THEY NEED TO ALSO FIX THE CAREPACKAGE THING WHEN YOU GO ONTOP OF ONE YOU DIE. This game is gonna end up like H1Z1 decent and abandoned by its creator. They still need to figure out some with the goddamn optimization and for some reason while the game is unfinished they decide to release it out of alpha. Despicable these Koreans should stick to what they're good at making MMO RPGS and thats not coming from a racist stand point thats coming from what they did before make mobas and these games. They have no experience except some kid that made Battle Royale mods for ing arma and abandoned his first project H1Z1 KOTK. Hope I could change your minds.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-02-17,0,0,168,False,Not Recommended,Brazilian player here.Can't recommend the game at this current state. Not enough optimization even if i have a somewhat potato pc it should run a little better destiny 2 did. Tick rates are insane and i won't even begin to talk about diferent supports in diferent regions (We need a little better support here). Bugs in vehicles are sometimes hilarious sometimes enfuriating there's a lot of inconsistancy there. The main reason is due to hacking. I see that North America players are asking for region lock primarily locking China and even if i understand their frustration there are lot of hackers on South America also for this reason locking China isn't the full solution. The real problem is on the actions that are not severe enough or not put enough effort into baning. While playing in squad is the main reason i play this game i can't enjoy it a little more competitive when whole squad drops in 4 seconds 1 kill per second when someone shows up with any weapon. If is about to happen a region lock please do support the other servers the fun of this game is playing togheter with quality.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The only thing holding the game back is the misconception the devs have to why players want the game to be region locked. I'm sorry it's not xeonphobia that makes the player base want china to be region locked. The player base wants china region locked due to nearly all cheaters coming from their plus they have an advantage when playing on NA due to them having extremely high ping allowing them to shoot where players were before they ducked around a corner and have it register as a hit even though its not. The quality of my games have been going down steadily and it is really not worth playing unless i have a full squad on.Please fix this game.

Now it's a game you play just to goof around with friends or if you have nothing to do and decide to give the game another chance. There is very little skill involved at this point since the server desync is just ridiculously unpredictable. Headshots basically do nothing no matter what range you are at (Just search youtube and you'll find a butt load of clips where the shots just don't register at all). Also constant updates that ""improve"" the server perfomance... ever thought of removing the clothes that spawn in every single house?Also region locking all servers?

2018-02-26,0,0,548,False,Recommended,"This game is very enjoyable and below I will list my Pros and Cons.Pros Rewarding in the sense of getting your first chicken dinner. Realistic items (IE Guns armor vehicles graphics) none of the Super Duper Crazy Mode Shotgun or Quadruple Barreled Revolver. Can find lots of different communities on Discord that make the squad based mode a lot more fun. Can find tactical people or chill players what ever you want! Overall gameplay is great. Competitive communityCons Lag at the worst of times however its rare these days (for myself) Cheaters the number has dropped significantly for me since I first played however. Before it was 4 or 5 every game now I might get 1 every 10 games or so. Connection into lobby this needs to be fixed. When you join a game (usually always my first game of the day but sometimes more) it gets stuck on the PUBG loading screen. No sound nothing. Will usually correct itself but can be frustrating at times. No Unranked servers. I would like this a lot because theres times where I want to mess around but not screw with my ranking. (IE Crate hunting games or pistols only) View distance. There is nothing worst than getting a ghillie suit finding some tall grass sniping with flash hider and getting pegged off from someone 300 yards away because the grass doesn't render for them that far and it's like you're sitting on a flat background. Graphic Settings ""cheaters"" same as above sort of but by reducing your graphics to low you get an advantage as less foliage renders in giving you more ground to look at for people who are prone.Mixed Feelings Loot boxes I am fine with loot boxes as they are purely cosmetic items and give zero benefit to the game. However they've introduced a box that now requires you to purchase a key for $3.00 CDN and that's just wrong in my eyes. As a side note for beginners or anyone who hates playing with random people in squads and always use that as an excuse for region lock join a discord server and find some people to play with. It's not hard at all and can get a squad in 3 minutes of looking.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-03-01,0,0,174,False,Recommended,When it comes down to it this is a really fun game. Some games aren't as fast paced as others and some are just downright slow for 10 minutes or more (You literally see no one). You also have a lot of influence on how each particular game plays out especially in the beginning. This makes for a very unique experience in every match. When you get to the last ten players it starts to get really intense. Somone could pop out of anywhere you might even have just walked by someone hiding in a bush that is going to shoot you in the back of the head. So you always have to be aware of your surroundings.This game may still need a lot of work but it's also priced at half of what your usual game would cost. So really it's a lot for the value. While I do not agree with loot crates they are purely cosmetic and I don't feel like I need them to be as cool as the next guy. Unfortunately including loot crates also promotes cheating. I've been lucky enough to feel like I don't really encounter them too often but I definitely believe it is a problem as there is so much money to be made by doing so. Bluehole does seem to be working hard to deal with the cheaters though.So all things considered I would highly recommend this game. At the moment it should not be taken too seriously as there is still a long way it needs to go. At this current time though it still provides many hours of fun and the devs update it very frequently and have come a long ways in really not that much time. So I have faith in them continuing with their improvements and look forward to a game that continually evolves and becomes something much better than it is even now.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-02-03,0,0,27,False,Recommended,It has everything you'd think this game should have. The custom matches don't work yet but this game is still in beta. When it becomes available. I'd like a setting to allow the map's alphabetical boxes that grid the map as you look at it to become randomly filled with the blue circle thing instead of the blue circle thing restricting you to a defined region that you have to run your *** off to get to. It would make it more like Battle Royale the movie. Since that's what they do in the movie. They marked the maps to regions that were 'locked' and anyone inside of it would die off if they remained in it. This would give the online battles more longevity for those who like to have things feel a bit more campy. Plus it would make it easier for beginner players to survive longer.Also maybe opening up the workshop would be nice to have some custom weapons and armor and clothing etc. Although the grid blue box thing would be the only thing I'd want more out of anything else.I am not sure what else I thought might be nice for this game. Although that's all. I will return and fix this review when I've thought of more stuff. Otherwise It's a great game and I can see why people play it so often. Worth checking out for an hour.

On one hand I ve had a lot of fun with friends doing impossible things and killing other players. Had great times. But now that it is nearing 1.0 the thing that I used to ignore ""because it s still just a beta"" hasn t gotten any better the optimization. You will die because someone shot you through a corner. You will kill someone because they accidentally glitched through a wall. And none of this has been improved in a long time. The client side of things are pretty smooth (60FPS+) but the server code simply needs a lot of work. You need to wait until a few people die at the beginning of the game so the game doesn't screw you up. You end up trying to pick a simple gun and some bullets at least 5 times because the game just won't let you. So in summary sure you re gonna have some fun with friends.

2017-11-03,0,0,20,True,Not Recommended,"I really liked the idea at the start but extremely liked the idea of being first person only hell I got to the second person alive at one time.However after waiting and waiting and waiting for first person only servers to be released for the Oceania area I grew bored of it. I can't play the Asian servers because of the immense lag I get and it isn't my internet oh no I have Fibre (Gigabit Fibre in fact due to this being a newly made house in a new area). I don't really enjoy being killed from someone camping inside a room using the third person camera to peek outside of said room. I understand that it's a game mechanic but with the option of having first person only servers I would rather play that.Aside from that there isn't much in terms of progression aside from being top x that is really it hell you don't get much in terms of being the overall winner it'd be nice if you got a box at the end or something.This game is $40 for me (NZD) and in reality I paid for something that I didn't get too much out of the thrill wore off at the start and well what can I say it's boring waiting for them to have first person servers in other areas. I get they are adding new maps and such that's awesome but with something already implemented it should be easy enough to open up a server in different areas it isn't like they have to recreate anything DevOPs was made to be able to clone something that works for a reason.Also the talk of hackers is sad this game must have made enough money to hire a whole company to dedicate their time to bug test and find every exploit possible but it seems like that isn't the case. There are bugs that have yet to be fixed and the IRRITATING bit is the refresh of the start menu I get it Bluehole developed the game I get it this game idea was decidedly and assumed to be made by ""Player Unknown"" when in fact if you look at the idea it's a rip from a book.You can get this thrill from playing the free version of fort nite and once the hype wears off you'll be where I am bored.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-22,0,0,536,True,Recommended,Everything below still applies the game has had waves of cheaters stroll through and get banned which has severly hurt the playability as well as the complete non optimization of the game to run on the PC. This is worrisome as the game comes close to launch in December and it still behaves as a BETA. I sincerely hope it does well but I don't think this is going to continue to trend upwards as other publishers and developers have jumped on the concept to make their own versions. This is a review of the July Early Access. So far exceeds my expectations for an early access it plays like a Mod (surprise right?) and has its fair share of bugs and glitches.That being said it will probably create a new niche similar to WC3 DOTA led to stand alone MOBAs (or which ever one you believe). Large scale well done battle royale the game play is over all fun adaptable and epitomizes the combat is 90% boring waiting and preparing and 10% pi$$ing yourself when taking fire from an unknown direction. (Disclaimer this in no way actually resembles real life combat or the life and death stakes of it. It's still just a game.)You can have several different play styles from super aggressive to pacifist trying not to kill anyone and still win but the game rewards those who think about movement timing patience and skill. But it still throws everyone for a loop with randomness.TLDR Hunger Games on steroids set in Russia with mostly modern weapons.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-09-19,0,0,179,True,Recommended,"Product received for free. I recieved this game for free so I might as well play it to see what the hype is all about as most of my steam friendslist have turned to PUBG. I have played matches with a squad of friends and solo for most of the time i find myself just playing with a friend.you can most likely solo the game on the solo que but its not as fun as having someone to back you up and talk with you through a wasteland filled by 100 people itching to kill each other as much as possible just play with a friend since its not insta kill and you might have a shot to make a comeback.Personally I found this game fun. its not perfect but its fun and I find myself with the itch to get on and play the game when I am in the mood. I believe its the fast paced first half of the game is what I am looking for Scavenge (Fun) Gear up (Fun) Kill People (Fun) but as soon as the game hits Mid to End game its just heart pumping survival and I think thats what makes the game Interesting but not fun why? because everybody has the mindset of winning and its anybody's game. you being so close to that chicken dinner and suddenly robbed by the opportunity to win. which comes to some of the bad parts of the game and I am sure it has happened to most people.BUGS GLITCHES SUDDEN STUTTER and ETC...anything can happen in game the game is in alpha and is not optimized to suit everybody's pc specs which has made the game unplayable to some. ""the game is not optimized"" hearing the crowds plea and screaches. we are nearing the 6th month of the games release and I am sure PU and the team are doing what they can for the people. realistically we wont see an fps increase or stutter fixes bug fixes etc. within a year of updates. the game has alot of potential and has already set the standards for most people as this game brushed DOTA 2 off to 2nd place of most played games on steam so let the game sit for awhile let it breathe and in few months improvements will come one by one.Ill be honest anyone who has knowledge to create a game can make a fun battleroyal game. anyone. it just so happens that PUBG was one of the first along side KOTK if you ask me if PUBG did not have the player base then it would not be as successful as it is right now. given that the game has alot of unoptimized bugs glitches errors stutters etc.. I would not play it if I had to wait 5 10minutes to find a match. there are alot of games that are battleroyal based which is actually fun if you look around although fun as well they do not have the player base and thats the reason why I play PUBG is because I dont have to wait to get in a match after being hit by my stupidity every match as I commit common mistakes and dying to it with regret in my heart I can just click matchmake again and play.So do I Recommend the Game?Yes you can suck out all the fun on your first hours of the game since learning a new game is always a fun experience. Its gameplay is what makes players come back for more ""I can do better"" or ""Just one more"" mentality OR if you are a Sick Mental Individual and just enjoy genocide then click matchmake and sooner or later you are chained to the game. play with someone each match is a new and different experience which you and your friend(s) can laugh about. let the inner killer in you out and try and survive to get a taste of the dinner.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-02-26,0,0,405,False,Recommended,I've had this game since one month into Early Access. I have seen every change patch and countless bugs to this day. I have played this game quite a lot as well. That being said this is my review. TL DRRecommend? YesPrice? Completely worth itGood/Bad PC? GoodHacking Issue? OverratedGameplay? Extremely fun solo or w/ friendsLoot Boxes/Microtransactions? 7 Crates. 3 Of them require keys. Don't worry about loot boxes.Skill Cap/Difficulty? Easy to learn/Hard to masterReplayability? Extremely highBugs? There are quite a few but honestly most of them are just funnyShould I buy this game? Do you like shooters having fun with friends the occasional foreign screaming car explosion or random death by someone completely across the map? If so get this game. If not get this game anyway. I honestly cannot think of anyone that would not have at least 50 hours of fun for this game. PLAYERUKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS has filled me with a sense of accomplishment and excitement unlike any other game has for a few years now. When I first bought this game I could feel my heartbeat increasing as the match progressed. At this point I was only in top 60. This game allows a ton of hours of fun. It's fun to play solo however if you get a squad or even a duo it's 10x better.PUBG has also had a fair share of problems throughout it's life. In Early Access it was extremely buggy. There was an issue with optimization as in most super computers locking at 30 fps. Bluehole did a very good job of putting out some small weekly bug patches and bigger monthly bug patches however most of the community felt they were being ignored with optimization since Bluehole seemed to not be prioritizing it. This was in Early Access. A ton of patches tuning down my resolution and graphics and one SSD later I am finally running the game at a constant 60 80 FPS. I don't have a fantastic gaming computer however it is only a couple years old. Should this much work have happened to play this game at a constant 60 FPS? No no it shouldn't have and this is one of the biggest issues I have with this game. If you have a mediorcre or average PC I suggest getting a different game if you cannot handle this.Hackers. Yeah it has them. But honestly playing through almost 300 hours I have not encountered a ton. If you are hesitant on buying this game because of the potential hackers ignore it. If that is your only reason for not buying this game yet stop waiting and buy it already. The hackers are exaggerated. Yes there are a few bad hackers that you will encounter say 1/25 games. But it is still worth it to buy this game.This game has gone through many changes including some controversial patches such as introducing paid crates focusing on cosmetics and maps rather than optimization questionable priortization etc. However I feel like this game is 100% worth $30 even with some cosmetic microtransactions and loot boxes. Final Words Most of the issues with this game are exaggerated and blow way out of proportion. The community enjoys making a bigger deal out of things. This game is fun. It has issues like every other game on the market. Oh and yes it is better than Fortnite.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-04-16,0,0,172,False,Not Recommended,Update March 2018 Downvote due to the lack of a map selection. Getting 5+ times on the map you dont want to play just to exit back to the menu and queque again is a joke.Original review Since some early access fails like DAYZ and The Forest which are in EA for YEARS now i normaly try to avoid any early access title.However when i saw this game i had to buy it. Awesome game so far. There are still bugs and optimization is a joke in the current state. But the gameplay is so fun!/edit after upgrading to 16 gb ram the performance is no issue anymore... so if you have 12+ ram you should be fine (and equal gpu and cpu ofc).,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-02-22,0,0,439,False,Recommended,Played over 250 hours on this game. Pro's and Con's really. Great game graphics are good gameplay is 'ok'. However this game is incredibly buggy... you'll be lucky if you sometimes make it on to the plane. Black screen saying PUBG lasts around 5 minutes if you just sit there but half the time you'll die before you even make it in the game. (I am not the only person experiencing these issues). Laggy servers sometimes people will lag when you try and shoot them again not the only person experiencing this issue. Before you start releasing new crates and a new map sort the gameplay out it's getting to the point where I feel PUBG is not optimized for PC or Xbox One. It needs a revamp (gameplay). If someone asked me about PUBG this would be my response. 35% is positive whereas 65% is negative. If PUBG don't sort their 'stuff' out then it will start to lose people. I am putting a yes to recommendation as It can be a great game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-03-24,0,0,345,True,Recommended,EDIT I am addicted nowThe game is really intense... the fact that you only have one life makes it more brutal then any other shooter that I have tried even in the lines of Red Orchestra and Squad. You have to be careful and thoughtful in your movement and resource usage which I really like. Rushing in this game will always kill you (and a ganker in a toilet.. yea.. never forget about that one in a toilet)I noticed that even the game is very demanding and you end up dying alot here it also has this sweet balance in match duration. The matches seem to last just enough time to make dying not so frustrating knowing that you can always jump into another game which would only last 15 ish minues.On the technical note I am writting this one on its first day of ea and also I am seeing subpar fps and occasional stuttering and teleportation the entire thing feels write and I have no doubt that dev are taking this project seriously and all will be ironed out sooner then later (looking at you DayZ),PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-03-24,0,0,209,True,Recommended,Positives 1. Fun immersive gameplay including a great map and a few different weather scenarios.2. Good gunplay not arcade style and not too clunky either.3. Good variation of guns vehciles building types and end game locations.4. Great fun to play in squads.5. Leaderboard system to see how much you suck or pwn.6. Truely an exciting gaming experience being in the last few alive.Negatives 1. I have a 980Ti Overclocked and acheive 20 100 FPS with constant drops stutters and hitches (On Low/Med. 1440p using most of the tricks from the Reddit optimisation guide). The game isn't demanding and barely uses 50% GPU or CPU at this point. With optimisation this game could take off properly.2. 26 is fairly high considering the current state of the game and various other BR games can be had cheaper.3. No way to see ping in game killboard or various other UI items that would be considered standard in most modern games.4. It takes a long time to unlock each box (that gives you ONE cosmetic item) and the items so far seem to be terrible I.e. brown shoes grey t shirt etc. 5. The nature of the circle shrinking in a random location can make the end game pure luck for a win or a loss.Overall it's enjoyable but needs higher FPS. The game has brilliant potential and a steep learning curve but it's worth it for that WINNER WINNER CHICKEN DINNER!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-03-23,0,0,75,True,Recommended,"Keep in mind this is an alpha and my following statements must be taken into consideration with that thought in mind.First right off the bat the game has set a precendent for greatness. I only have limited time in it but the few rounds I've played I can say that for a new early access alpha it has done better than its predecessors. Pros Fairly unique style.A large map.Ability to parachute where you want.Weapons work and bullets go where you expect them to go.Hit registration seems on point.Cons Price in alpha is too much.Some sort of lag input between the mouse and keyboard.Smoothness is on par but borderline awkward.Sound isn't precise.The UI isn't exactly user friendly.""Peeking"" (Q and E keys) is odd.Using the F key to interact is wierd.Picking up items has a slight delay.You'd expect right click to use your red dot sight but in my case it did not (I have to work out the controls I guess). Otherwise it seems like the development team is on point with updates. I haven't ran into hackers yet but I don't doubt there will be some issues with that as with all multi player alphas. As far as completeness goes it seems they've done a much better job with development and release to the general public than most alphas.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-03-24,0,0,27,True,Recommended,I played a good amount of BR in H1Z1 before it became KOTK and really enjoyed that but this is another level up from that entirely. The gun play feels good the graphics are decent and the map is detailed. Matchmaking is super quick even with duo and squad play (probably due to the amount of players). Squad play is the most fun for me playing this game with friends and the communication needed to suceed is a real treat.Yes the performance is less than ideal at the moment but the road map shows the expectation of big improvements by April 14th. Till then I'm still enjoying the game even with the dips in frames.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-05-28,0,0,825,True,Recommended,alright mates after losing my real life to this game i have deemed it worthy of my first review.i give the game a 9.5/10i highly recommend this game for anyone who prefers suicide over victory as you will be running into gunfire for your first few matches. this game requires you to act fast and be tactile. its not always best to fire at anyone you see. as anyone who is just watching like a true predator will scope you out faster than you can jerk it. as of the recent updates the game is more and more playable. i started playing towards when it first came out. while still fun it was loaded with bugs and hilarious glitches. most of those are no more! scopes have been fixed since there was a split second lag. may not seem like much but trust me when firing at squads hiding behind trees all latency is apparent. i do wish the motorcycle with the side car would be tweaked so it doesnt flip as easy but who uses that pos anyway? im in love with the tweaks done to the submachine guns especially the ump which is now a viable weapon to use. the graphics are pretty nice but id like to see more done with it. currently able to run normal settings at 60 70fps average with gtx 10870 + fx 8350(upgrading soon). server desync is quite a problem that i have faced but it usually smooths out in a second or so.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-11-22,0,0,61,False,Not Recommended,I think my main gripe with this game is that multiplayer matches where your group doesn't fully wipe are just time sinks. If you die close to the start of a match and your team makes it to top 10 you've effectively wasted 15 30 minutes. You can choose to spectate the rest of your team flounder against a full strength squad to grab that dinner or alt tab out and watch YouTube videos. Solo is arguably better in that perspective but just not up my alley.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-03-15,0,0,106,False,Not Recommended,This game has grown tremendous amount of popularity for the battle royale genre but sadly the devs of this game don't care about its actual gameplay but instead continue to milk the game for money. I bought this game about a year ago having a first go at it having 30 fps on lowest settings and not liking the gameplay. Started to come back to the game recently and since I've come back they've not seemed to fix any of the lag or desync but now there also seems to an issue with cheaters and Chinese people being forced to play on western servers because of the amount of cheaters on the Asian servers.People post almost everything about this game to region lock China so they cant ruin the experience for the western players but then the Chinese that play fairly and want to win have no chance of doing so. This game needs to fix its hacking epidemic optimize the game engine and stop making useless updates like emotes.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2018-03-15,0,0,296,False,Not Recommended,Riddles with hackers which devs won't do anything about. Lag is a huge issue and this game is severely overpriced for the experience it gives you. Looting is bugged as you will randomly drop helmets/armour/ammo/guns and sometimes when speed looting it wont even pick some stuff up.Plenty of other Battle royal games that offer a better experiene without the hackers and the bugs. Money hungry company that dosn't care about its community. Micro transfactions through crates which you need keys for which are $2.30 on the market when the game itself costs $30 is horrible. Bad business Model for an even worse game. If i could I would refund it but i have spent plenty of hours trying to find the positives in this game but there is none.Circles are way too scripted and not randomised around the map enough (on both maps) sound quality of airdrops going past and red zones are way too loud. Way too many vehicale spawns and when looking through 8/15x scopes rocks regularly do not render in (even with a maxed out fiew distance)Rate this game 2/6 floppy socks,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-03-15,0,0,86,False,Recommended,Would I recommend the game? Yes. Is it a good game? Also yes.Is it great? No.PUBG is pretty much exactly what you want the generic go to large scale battle royale FPS. It's not groundbreaking or high art but it's exactly what you want for this kind of gamemode. It had standard guns action vehicles and map design. It's nothing too gimicky or stylized like the Culling which had elements that made it harder for you to just jump right into the action. With PUBG you just get right to it.If you like battle royale and want a game that's just battle royale and nothing else then this is it. However that's not to say this game is perfect.First off it's kind of clunky. The movements and actions don't feel very smooth at all and the controls don't feel satisfying. It feels like everything is dragging quite often. It doesn't have to be as simple as the movements in something like Half Life 2 but it definitely feels like there's room for improvement. Second and this might not be an issue for some but the game relies entirely on RNG meaning it's not really skill based but rather depends on who gets the best gear before everyone else. Personally it doesn't bother me but this is probably a shortcoming for most. However at te same time I have to agree it's kind of frustrating sometimes. You can go into a large building expecting there to be at least some loot but there's a high chance it's completely empty. It feels like everything video games taught me is a lie.Third and I don't know if this is just me but the ping on this game is pretty awful. The first few times I ran it not only did my game crash but it made my net go down entirely for my PC. Why? This is a guess but I don't think they really have a good enough servers for the amount of people trying to join a single server. Apparently the people who made this are modders not actual game developers so that might explain a lot. Fourth reigon locks and hackers. The UK or at least Europe doesn't seem to have this issue but if it's effecting anyone at all then it's a huuuuge issue. This should be a problem the developers should be on top of but they're instead working on emotes because I guess they're really terrified of Fornite doing better than them.You don't have to be like Fornite to be good just fix the problems that are making the game unplayable for a lot of people. You've made millions of dollars and are seemingly calling it a day. You can't do that. A lot of people care about your game and you're paying them back by ignoring huge glaring issues. Come on.CONCLUSION If you like battle royale or Hunger Games style games then you'll enjoy this game. If the problems above bother you then you won't enjoy this game. If you wanna be like me and hope it gets better over time then buy the game and see what happens. For now this reigon lock BS doesn't seem to be effecting Europeans so if you're in Europe you have even more reason to buy it.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-03-28,0,0,572,False,Recommended,First off this is a very good game but it also comes with its flaws. It's a one life battleroyal game to the death. You start off unarmed and run around looking for weapons to battle your way to the end game. The map is quite large so parts of the game can be quite quiet and you could go 1 15 minutes without seeing a person and even if you do you can be shot by someone hiding inside a building watching for people to run past. There is only one gamemode at the moment which is what I have described but hopefully the makers will bring more modes out for the future to make this a better game. Cons Can be laggy and desync sometimes plays a part in that Has been alot of cheaters in this game but they are working to improve it.

2017-11-23,0,0,211,True,Recommended,Honestly there are so many bad things that can balance out the good things. The lag on servers plus the influx of hackers make the game unbearable at times. But when you're in the top 10 situation with your friend on discord playing duo's with the stressful but amazingly fun moments it makes the game hard to judge.Bluehole isn't a perfect set of devs. Far from it. But they aren't EA. They haven't made it pay to win. They haven't outright tried to destroy their game. So a 7/10 is still positive. I do reccomend this game but mainly if you have someone to play it with. Alone just makes your realize all the quirks in the game.

2018-03-13,0,0,562,False,Recommended,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS for me is a love hate relationship. There are times where this game horrible optimization and game stability frustrates the hell at me and turns me away from playing it. But with the recent March 2018 content update I must say optimization has been greatly improved. People are always comparing this game to the recently released battle royal game Fortnite. Now as a player who has tons of hours on both games my favorite is still PUBG. To be fair Fortnite has a way better development team who listens to their player base and releases constant updates every week for there players to enjoy. PUBG on the other hand releases updates less frequently but when they do come out they add a lot of great content. Now lets talk about the gameplay. Now this might be quite opinionated depending on your experience and with that being said to me personally I love the gameplay. Gun play feels smooth interacting with your inventory is great driving with the recent update is greatly improved. Like holy its been way improved. Before the latest March 2018 content update driving felt horrible. Car handling was garbage. Now regarding the two maps that are currently in the game Erangel and Miramar. They both have completely different play styles with one having lots of mountainous terrain and the other being repetitively flat. My personal favorite map is the desert map Miramar because of the large open landscape and tons of huge cities to explore. But some negatives with this large open map is the difficulty to find enemies. Depending are where you drop it can take to the top 20 to 30 to start seeing people which might be a negative to some. Erangel on the other hand you will might find yourself in tons of more gunfights and struggling to find decent loot. Unless you drop it on the popular locations. With all this being said I love PUBG and will continue playing it almost every day. For $30 there is a lot of content here. We just got a cool new emote system steam achievement and a new jungle map releasing on the test server towards the end of the month. My rating for PUBG at its current state a 9/10 and cant wait for the new content to release.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-07,0,0,49,True,Recommended,It is truly a fun game... finding myself playing this more than I even watched gameplay of H1Z1... more to do etc. But it is early access and as such it has it's issues. I won't hold the issues against it since they obviously state it but in terms of development (and I do like how these devs are actually working on it) I wonder if the priorities of what needs to come and when are correct or not. Don't get me wrong I don't know what they have planned or in what order but there are certain things I wish the devs could put a little more priority in such as server delay or lag. Sure it can be a difficult fix for large scale map and hosting of 100 or so players but it can be heartbreaking being Top 5 in a match only to be killed while hiding around a corner or over a hill 100% in cover but still killed potentially because your body is still visible out of cover to another player. And the issue isn't a connection or hardware issue from my side so I'm confident in saying it's the game.Conclusion I'm not upset enough at the servers cucking me to be angry. The game is fun and I continue to play it despite some of the random BS I see and experience. Guess that's a really good thing huh? Coming back for more despite an abusive relationship? I feel like Rihanna.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2018-03-13,0,0,198,False,Not Recommended,The number of hackers makes playing the game an infuriating waste of time after you spend fifteen minutes surviving to be picked off by someone who has no line of sight and auto aims on your position.The games death cam will let you see just how blatant the cheating is and it is getting worse by the day. This used to be the main game I played with my friends and now none of us want to touch it.In addition to hackers prepare for constant ping abuse by players on the other side of the world who will get mad at you for speaking English on the North American server.TLDR The game had a lot of potential but the publisher has let cheating become rampant and in a game with no respawn it's just not acceptable and ruins the fun of a good survival shooter.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-11-23,0,0,195,True,Recommended,This game is an Early Access game right now but soon it is going to be completed as a full priced game (I think).Important is that in comparison to H1Z1 it lasts longer and the combat system forces you to wait and try to get a good positioning and not just run around trying to kill everybody.

2017-04-09,0,0,170,False,Recommended,"Below is my original review when I didn't reccomend it. I now recommend the game. I'm a bit lazy to write right now but most of what I mentioned in the below isn't an issue now worth the money. Old review Pubg is a fun game with a lot of potential however that's the issue. A game should not have potential it should have already achieved it. This is clearly an early access game that got released early because the devs realised that there wasn't much competition in 2017 so an early release allows them to gobble up rewards.The reality is that this game will be good in the future if the devs continue to develop it but if they do develop it further then isn't that admitting it was never finished? They've shot themselves in the foot with that one I think either admit it's not finished now or never acheive the potential. I wish they just called it continuos release rather than say ""It's done but we're still working on it""So all in all it's an early access with a full game price tag. Maybe one day it'll be worth the full tag but the hype will be over then. If the game is on sale get it it'll be worth it.

Everyone ive encountered has shot me from somewhere i cannot see them (leaning behind a tree or hiding in grass using a suppressed weapon) and nearly all my kills are from me hiding in tall grass or in a bush waiting for an unsuspecting player to walk by.im also not a massive fan of the cosmetics system in this game either. I feel at the start everyone looks very similar and once you save up your hard earned bp you end up getting a crate you need a key to open. the basic loot inside these crates i dont exactly like and the neato looking cosmetics are all rare and so have a high value. After they removed the clothing spawns ingame ive never been able to find any neat cosmetics when searching a house (i love the trenchcoat haha) and i dont see why they've done this. Sure it increases normal loot spawns but they can make them seperate and so you find weapons with the clothing.in my last few matches i havent really encountered any noticable bugs. which is a great improvement from when i used to play. The game used to be horrible to play bad fps loads of bugs and the graphics looked like doo doo. However i don't know if anyone else finds that its different for them.Anyhow its a fun lil game. best played with friends. however id wait untill this game goes on sale (if i ever does cos i dont think ive ever seen it on sale),PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-03,0,0,416,False,Not Recommended,Fun game but...The game needs a region lock (no Brendan it's not xenophobia). Unfortunately if you had to lock one region it would be AS/China but I think all regions should be restricted. There are enough Chinese players to keep those AS servers populated. There is no good reason to continue allowing Chinese players with either 300 ping or cheats (a sizeable percentage of them) to play on NA servers. They contribute NOTHING positive to the NA community. They can't communicate with NA players most of the time they will never have good connections to NA servers and they simply do not belong in servers on the other side of the world. They have their own servers... MAKE THEM USE THEM!I have no problem with players who live in China/other regions that want to play with friends/family in NA. The lock should only apply if every member of the lobby is originating from a region that is not the one they are connecting to. Ideally this means solo players should only ever be able to play in their own regions. This should apply to every region. If you are Polish Australian Korean Zimbabwaen or Turkish it does not matter. You shouldn't be able to queue into another region's servers unless you have a party member originating there. I realize that VPN's are a thing and it's not a perfect fix. Beside that Brendan you are an idiot to think this is about Xenophobia or racism. It's a matter of STABLE CONNECTIONS AND GAMEPLAY! IT'S NOT FUN TO SHOOT AT CHINESE HOUDINIS THAT TELEPORT AROUND LIKE MAGICAL GNOMES!EDIT 4/25/18 The problems with cheaters and Chinese laggers have gotten moderately better.

Unless you have a really high end PC with a great processor you're going to run into problems. I had to play on low/medium settings (the only game I've ever had to) and I was getting 10fps. It seems a real shame because from what I could play it was a good game. I just don't think it's ready in it's current state and perhaps needs optimising.

Rendered basically unplayable due to problems EA (gasp) and battlefield et al solved over a decade ago. Demonstrates power of streamers &amp their mentally handicapped fans to raise a mediocre product to a level way beyond warranted by any tangible merit. Looks like a lazy asset flip too.Refunded after an hour or so. Matches seem to consist of 3 parts 1) 5 minute frantic scramble for weapons and gear at the start.2) 20 40 minutes of nothing3) 5 minutes of placing the crosshair directly on enemies' heads and clicking inneffectually untill a chineese shoots you through the terrian.4)Rinse and repeat.The whole project reeks of a dev team trying to grapple with a concept that is simply beyond the limits their skill sets and competence.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-24,0,0,185,False,Not Recommended,PUBG the Most played game at the moment but it Perfectly shows that even if millions buy something it won't ake it good. Infact the game is a mess an absolute mess. The Anticheating Measures are an absolute joke back then Anti Cheat tools scanned before starting the game if something was off Battleye can do that too but only with a predefined list of tools with the speed Hackers come up with new things it makes it obvious that Battleeye is not able to handle it at all. The Optimization of the game is another joke and like the Anti Cheating Measures this one isn't funny At any given time the game is unable to maintain a stable FPS even high end machines struggle my PC isn't the Best anymore but if i can manage 60fps in Star citizen then PUBG should run way better hint it's not. The Game does not look that great to justify the needs. The server performance however is something odd sometimes it's good then it goes back to absolute garbage and that even within matches.The game has an amount of bugs never before seen anywhere else the game can basically crash at any given point Starting the game Joining a match or simply picking up an item people seen more bugs then enemies within just one match the Vaulting is hella bugged as well sometimes you can enter through a window but don't leave through the same window. Picking up Items is mostly Laggy and bugged most of the time it picks up the entirely wrong item. The community of the game is the hatechild of Dota League of Legends and Counterstrike GO the most Toxic community you can encounter ever. A bunch of Internet Rambos playing epeen meassuring on the Steam Forum those with a bit of intellect left already left the game for good.The Performance problems of the game could be explained quite easy Bluehole stopped giving a wet damn Xbox Version Mobile Version that's what they care about and you can see it the game is in an abysmal state and Blue Hole doesen't give a damn.

2018-02-24,0,0,653,False,Recommended,Sooner or later you will succumb to the inner feeling that you need to stop playing this game.Largely down to two things 1. The inconsistency of performance and how flippantly they seem to break the game and fix the game right now actually it seems in a good place drag looting feels the best it ever has and the game seems to be running smooth but there is always the inevitable feeling that the next patch will break the game.If the the impact of this was minute it wouldn't be so bad but when the game fails to load in half the time or a lag spike at the most inopportune moment it becomes intolerable.2. The loot. Honestly. You can sometimes loot half of a main town and come away with nothing... The 50/50 battles you might have with someone that lands at the same building as you fair enough it adds to the tension of the game and is a fundamental part of the Battle Royale Genre but looting 5 6 sizeable buildings and having a crossbow and shotgun at your disposal is frankly unacceptable.Sure this is randomised but jeez just increase the drop rates of loot I never heard once anyone complaint that there is too much loot in the game or that the game is being overly favourable towards you it is inconsistent beyond believe and unforgiving in doing so.I am recommending the game because as frustrating the game has become for me to the point where I cannot wait for a decent developer to come along and give us the Battle Royale game we want I put over 500 hours into this game and it gave me some of the most memorable gaming moments that I can think of. It is a fantastic game to play with friends very engaging and allows for each game to approached dynamically....But be warned...... as much as I wanted to love this game and play it for years to come....You will succumb to that feeling.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-11-24,0,0,679,True,Recommended,Where do I start? Anyone that has played this game already knows most of the obvious flaws with this title. PUBG is an early access battle royale title with early access imperfections that will not be reiterated doesn t make sense to. Focus on core gameplay and replay ability. First PUBG a massive free for all brings players together through intricate player driven lobby mini games that can be as unique as the core game itself. Second the butt clenching feeling of a rear exit door opening on a c 130 isn t executed at all instead it s replaced with random almost simultaneous screams of a particular #1 nation. Last gameplay is short within a few minutes of actually landing you are forced to harvest equipment for other players.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-04-28,0,0,101,False,Not Recommended,So the reason I m no recommending this game is because of the amount of cheating that goes on every game. Essentially the way the company has made this game encourages people to do it because they make money off selling items of clothing and the PUBG corporation does ban the accounts but the hackers just go and buy more accounts. So they have no reason to change the system because they re make loads of money. If you buy this game you will spend say 15 minutes+ getting some kit and then you will be shot by a guy not even looking from a long way away. Trailers and picutres look great but that isnt the game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The real issue is just inconsistency. Some good fixes would be 1) Allow players to choose what map they want to play2) Have the game remember what game mode was played last3) Improve optimization by just removing grass4) Improve net code to reduce packet loss which results in desync or bad hit regGame is barely a 3/10,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I have yet to encounter a hacker as so many reviewers say keep in mind I play on EU servers. The performance is honestly not as bad as some are painting it to be. It could definetely be much much better which it will be (I've tried the 1.0 test servers) but even as is it's not that bad. I play on low settings on a GTX 1060 with i7 2600k (oc'ed to 4.3) with 8 gigs of RAM and the FPS is generally above 60 with some drops to 30 40s in some areas.

2018-04-11,0,0,559,False,Not Recommended,This game has potential but for now I wouldn't recommend buying it unless it's on a serious sale.This game has been plagued with issues from the beginning hackers falling through the map flying into the sky and dying from fall damage server issues and much more Personally I don't have any issues with the performance but it's worth mentioning my computer is complete overkill for any game on the market so it should run well but your mileage may vary. This game can be fun with friends but the issues may grow on you to the point where you lose all trust in both the developer and the game itself. I really wish this game was brought up by a developer with an actual work ethic that isn't just interested in nothing but money. They don't fix the game they don't address the real issues with the game there is no love put into this game whatsoever and the insane amounts of money made from the game cashing in on the hype has not been put back into the game whatsoever. For the hours I have on the game I still got my moneys worth in term of entertainment but I really wish I hadn't given money to such an atrocious developer and I never will do so again assuming they don't go on vacation and never make a game again but maybe that would be a positive.For all informaiton on this game you won't have to look far for the current state of it but unless you're desperate for something new to play with friends I would urge considerable thought being put into this purchase even if you have money to burn.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-02-25,0,0,867,False,Recommended,Oh Plunkbat How I hate to love you. This is the first game I have surpassed 500 hours in and still find myself going back to. The premise is simple Jump onto an island with 100 other players find loot be the last alive. Sounds simple right? Until you realize at least 20 of those players also have 500 + hours and won't fall for your silly tricks. While I often joke as do others of how great a run simulator this game is (You do have to spend quite a bit of time running across the map usually trying to avoid the ever encroaching blue circle of death) the thrill of spotting an unsuspecting player across the map with your 8x scope is hard to surpass. The long periods of waiting hiding listening is broken with sheer chaos of automatic weapon fire explosions and when in luck the triumphant victory over the opposing team. I played the game in third person view on Solo for about 100 hours before finding the real gem of the game Is in playing on teams. Whether Duo or Squad (First Person View if you do not want to get cornered or shot by someone who did not have you in their line of sight) provides an endless dialogue of strategy and entertainment for you and your teammates. Whether you enjoy skirting the edge of the map preferring to remain silent until the end game or jumping into the death zones for instant action there is a element to PUBG that I have not found in any other shooter. The fulfillment of getting a kill in this game is leagues beyond any other game I have played.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-03,0,0,79,True,Recommended,Excellent game even while having to nerf the graphics for my 7870 to keep up. Definitely needs a very up to date PC and a bit more optimisation but this game ****s all over anything I've played in the last 20 years or so... really hope it's cross platform servers when it goes live on console as I have a feeling this will attract a lot of people.Hard to pin point what makes this so incredible the scenery almost reminds me of being lost in a San Andreas trip through the countryside but it's sooooo much bigger than that. Even when you haven't got an enemy to shot at (which can happen for long periods early on) you constantly have that shimmering blue wall of death penning you in. There is nothing more annoying than someone pinning you down in the deadzone when that's closing in... you have to go for it and several times now I've died to that in the last 5 or 10 standing.Really hope this stays as good as it is and avoid the microtransaction market. This has the potential to be a COD killer in my eyes and for all the right reasons.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2018-04-07,0,0,165,False,Recommended,I have over 150 hours on this game granted that's not as much as some people but I enjoy the game. Do I think there are stupid ways I ended up loosing like my car glitching out? Yeah but all the fun times I've had with my friends on this game make it worth it. I personally don't play solo as that's just not really my style but I think they are trying to cater to a big crowd now. I really don't think the game was ready to be dropped onto console like it was and probably not even mobile but I get it you have to spread your resources to compete especially now that Fortnite is taking over. I think the new map is really going to help those who want a faster game in PUBG and I personally wish I could choose what map you'd like to play on so I don't have to leave right after joining a game when it's a map I don't like but thats a minor thing for me.

I have been pretty consistently playing for nearly a year and I can still easily recall so many hilarious and amazing moments from that one year alone.If I didn't have friends to play this with I would probably give it a negative review.

2018-01-03,0,0,241,False,Not Recommended,I ve been playing this since EA. It was a decent game back then hard to win but it was possible even though the weapon damage is a joke its like i m using rubber bullets... D but i really liked it. I ve never been really good at it but got my fair share of chicken dinners.Now that its released i loved the new jump mechanic it was horrible in EA but after a few rounds i was suspicous that im being killed by cheaters. As time passed and now im barely able to get into top 10 i realized that its true.Cheaters in every second game i play. Shooting with autoaim or through walls or just high ping players killing me after im behind cover. I just cannot accept this.Though i have no problem with any nation Chinese people flooded all the servers. Not just the problem that 90% of cheaters are Chinese but if you want to play in squad they just talk in their own language making it unable to enjoy a random squad game.Pro + Nice graphics+ Fun game mode+ Huge playerbaseCons Cheaters everywhere nowadays Game crashes in the middle of the match then wont let you reconnect. 9 out of 10 times it forces me to play on the desert map i hate Weird weapon damage Serious latency issues Worst rentable servers New paycrates but only cosmetic item so idc Every promise they made proved to be untrue to this point. In the past few weeks nothing was improved Hitregistration is a complete messAs of now 1/10 UnplayableHigher ping means low ping players can hardly hit you while you can hit them any time you want. )Do not buy this product now.

On the new map... It is fun to play but I feel there are just far too many wide open spaces with not enough cover to move across safely with the way the game renders textures etc. Recent updates have improved performance for me and my friends that I play with.

Winning is up to RNGesus and hiding but it's still fun to win the game especially when your only kill is the final kill.For an open world game though optimization is absolutely terrible. It's an 8gb game that looks and runs like poo. Graphics aren't everything though. The game mechanics also aren't done yet... And there are tons of hackers which is the worst part.

2018-04-11,0,0,278,False,Recommended,"I have around 142 hours in this game so I guess it's enough to leave a review.First the game mode is amazing. Everything is so fast and you need to constantly be on point that it's hard not to enjoy it. It kinda becomes annoying after a while when you're spending 20 minutes into a game just to die to a guy who had a better position than you but that's just how things work.Sadly that's pretty much the only good thing I can say the game mode is fun.After playing for so long I get why some people would rather go to Fortnite or anything similar most games run better than this one A LOT better.I think PUBG is at the present moment the only competitive shooting game I like but man they make it SO DAMN HARD to love it when everything runs so bad.If you're having a great day and A LOT of luck you may be able to play 5 or 6 games in a row without having to open Task Manager to close the game because it stops working.If you're REALLY lucky you may not have to experience the neverending ""Initializing"" loading screen that appears before the main menu. I can't even count the amount of times I had to close the game because it stopped working.And just to clear this out I have a good computer Ryzen 7 1700 GTX 1080 and 16 GB of RAM. The game is simply poorly optimized and it's SO DAMN FRUSTRATING.Talking about optimizing I'm playing The Witcher 3 with everything on Ultra and the game runs at over 80 FPS all the time but this damn game has pretty much the same FPS with EVERYTHING on VERY LOW.That's just t.When it comes to cheaters I only encountered one that for some reason knew where I was without even seeing me once. And I mean I've been staying in the same house for over 5 minutes because I had something to do on my phone. There was no way for him to know where I was but suddenly he came right to the house I was in and started throwing grenades exactly in the room I was in.But except for that situation I didn't encounter any cheaters and if I did I didn't notice it.I don't regret buying this game it's a lot of fun especially at the beginning when you don't really know what you're doing. You're just having fun and dying over and over again.However when it comes to how the game runs I'm really ing disappointed low FPS with a damn GTX 1080 o in my computer with everything set to VERY LOW the game constantly stops working and I have to close it again and again. When it comes to audio well it just has a mind of its own. If you're lucky you'll actually hear where someone's shooting from. If you're not you're gonna spin in circles trying to figure out how the the guy is shooting from everywhere just to look at the death cam after you die and see he was 5 meters away and you couldn't ing see him because you were looking in the wrong place after the audio decided to make it sound like he was on the other side of the god damn map!I can't complain when it comes to how fun it is because I have over 140 hours in it so that's something but I invested $30 into a game with so many problems? Feels bad man.I'm surprised they just don't do something about it because even if you don't compare the game with things like The Witcher 3 Wolfenstein or any other single player game out there games similar to PUBG start coming out and they are doing great because guess what they don't have as many problems as this one.No bugs no problems decent FPS and a lot of fun. That's why people love Fortnite right now and they will keep loving it if the developers know how to make use of the luck they got and add more interesting things to the game in the future.Sadly Bluehole is blind compared the the people working on Fortnite and they care so little about how the game works that sooner or later it will probably die and people will just focus on a game that you can actually play without having the Task Manager constantly open just in case something doesn't go right.I truly hope they do something with this game to improve its performance. I don't give a crap about skins. I just want the game to run well and then I'll start playint it for entire hours a day once again.Sorry for any grammatical mistakes )",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Uninstalled everything and still the same issue while the rest of the steam or non steam games runs smoothly.So I tryed contacting the support team for a solution and the only answer was to refund the game.A shame of a trendy game that could mark gaming history in the hands of a.... *i let you finish that*,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-11-25,0,0,250,True,Recommended,Some flaws but fun and exciting gameplay. As the circle closes the game gets more and more intense each choice requiring precision to survive and get a chicken dinner. The weapon quality is great fairly balanced and intriguing gameplay. The matches are short enough to not matter if you win or lose but long enough to provide quality gameplay. It's less competitive nature allows for the bulk of less skilled players (myself included) to not have to grind or take the game really seriously. It's an amazing buy especially for an early access game and my recommendation couldn't be stronger.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-04-06,0,0,228,False,Recommended,Summary(TLDR) PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds(or more commonly known as PUBG) is a battle royale game where you and up to 99 other players are dropped either by yourselves or in squads of 2 3 or 4 on an island. The goal is simple kill till you are the last person or team standing. This game has had its fair share of problems hacking bugs and optimization issues but it honestly has improved immensely since release I used to only get around 40 frames with everything on low/med. NOW I get over 90 frames on everything high/maxed. They have decent customization options and they just added skins. All in all this game is worth the money though I would recommend playing squads starting out with a group of friends who can show you the ropes because you will die a lot starting out and with squads you go down first you can learn from your mistakes. This is a game with some luck in it but good amounts of skill positioning and teamwork can beat the luckiest of people. BEST WAY TO PLAY(CASUAL) Mess around do random things grab 4 cars in squads and run up on random players blaring your horns. Or something random to lighten up the mood after a heartbreaking loss or frustrating defeat.(SEMI CASUAL) Mess around somewhat until 50 people die then decide to get somewhat more serious.(HARDCORE) Land tactically work together call out effectively position yourselves evenly distribute gear but making sure people are confident with what they have.(TRYHARD) Land either at the end or the beginning and work together and dominate so hard that it would make soldiers blush. Then if any of the petty casuals thought it would be a good idea to land with you rip them a new one. Every squadmate has a role and is near perfect at what they need to do.(NOTICE) IT IS NOT RECOMMENDED TO PLAY TRYHARD OR HARDCORE ALL THE TIME IT WILL MAKE YOU RAGE MIX IT UPIF YOU GO HARDCORE ONE MATCH AND LOSE GO SEMI CASUAL IF YOU GO TRYHARD AFTERWARDS GO CASUAL.Sidenotes/MisconceptionsAlso just keep in mind one thing if you get hit by your own car its because S is to reverse SPACEBAR is to break and if you want to stop you car IRL DO YOU REVERSE INTO IT? NO YOU hit the breaks! Vehicles will roll down hills! If there are two players left and both fire at each other at the same time who ever bullet speed is faster from their gun will win you both don't die. They thought about this the guns all have different muzzle velocities. If you are in cover and in third person and you shoulder aim and your crosshair is aim on another player but your body isn't far enough over and you shoot and you hit a wall it's because you are too far off to the side you can prevent this by looking next to your characters gun if you're not far over enough there will be an red X in front of your weaponThere are bugs such as where when you ram into a vehicle and you go a thousand feet into the air you may fall and get launched (Though I have never had the privilege of experiencing said bugs) are honestly quite fun. Again this is extremely populated game with 2 million players on it at once per day there are going to be people who find bugs.Yes there are hackers but they are banning them in large quantities (But again I only ran into 1 3 in over 150 hours and it was more of the guy snapped onto me when they didn't know where I was not the speed hacker or super aimbot type)All in all I would recommend this game it has a few bugs but it's more of the WTF THAT'S HILARIOUS sort of bugs. 8.9/10 Would Drive a motorcycle over a cliff do 2 back flips and stick the landing again.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2018-04-06,0,0,27,False,Recommended,The game is cool and all but I feel like ya'll are playing with our emotions when it comes to custom matches. That is one of the things us players are waiting for. My friend bought us this game to play against each other with our other friends and we can't. Had we known that prior to purchasing the game we most likely would not have bought it yet. None the less we did purchase and not quite happy. Don't get me wrong the PUBG is fun to play. But our intentions was not met. And for that is why my friend and I are not happy. I hope that you will allow us to create our own custom matches soon enough. Thank you.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Arma 2 Arma 3 H1Z1 Rust EtcBut all of them had issues that really did not make the games so fun as they should have bin Anything from broken guns to just being super laggy or buggy but PUBG changed that! PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS This game is really damn fun it is a mix of Realistic but as well has a bit of arcade to it the game has not bin out for a very long time so knowing that and that it is in a Beta stage. The game itself is really stable and yes the FPS still need a bit of work to be done with but I actually get better fps on PUBG then i did on H1Z1 and that is pretty damn sad! Loot System The loot system is really well made because they actually have Gun attachments in the game but not only that the loot in put into a Tier System (1 being bad 3 being the best) so its not like in H1Z1 where you look for 4 mins and you're all looted up and just camp the rest of the game. In PUBG you're scavenging stuff the whole game looking for scopes and such to make sure that you are set up for all situations! Guns There is a nice Arsenal in the game and more guns will be added. Each gun has its weakness but as well each gun has its good side Anything from an Ak47 having awesome damage but the recoil being really high or the m16 doing less damage but being really has no recoil so its nice for long range battles. There is as well SMG(s) and Shotguns(s) and yes in this game the Shotguns actually work pretty darn good! You as well can get some special guns that you will only find in Airdrops like AWM M24 M249 Tommy gun. Other stuff There is a nice amount of cars in the game and the physics for the cars are much better then H1Z1 they flip less and they handle much better then they did in H1Z1. Other stuff as the Animations and movement is really well done as well Only thing is missing is Vaulting because sometimes trying to jump over something can be a bit of an issue! Pros Great Map Good Hit reg Lots of nice guns Working Cars Custom Servers Solo Doubles Squad Great Looking Game Really fun to play Cons FPS Drops Server Issues No Seasons Prices is a bit High A few small Bugs Game Crashes Sometimes Final Vedic I love this game it's one of the most stable early access games I have ever played on steam and yes the price for the game is a bit high but if you can get the money for the game then you should most likely buy it!

Good time with a group of firends!

2017-07-03,0,0,300,True,Recommended,PUBG is the King of Battle Royale style games (pun intended). The gunfights are instense and require skill the map is incredibley balanced and the game is just plain fun. Being an Early Access game I expected there to be a lot of issues and maybe even some drop off with dev support. Nah...this game gets small weekly updates and then a huge monthly update that introduces useful features and addresses important parts of the game. Do yourself a favor and buy PUBG even if you're not into FPS'. You honestly don't even need to shoot anybody until the very end (even then they can die outside the safe zone) so if you're into stealth games this could also work for you.Drove Jeep full of entire squad off a steep hill did a backflip and exploded 10/10,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-04-05,0,0,675,True,Recommended,This game is really good despite my hours on it I haven't found very much game breaking glitches however I would recommend it as it's a very fun game. I do believe they would later come with cases that you can pay to get but for now it's just grinding for that certain case. When with a squad or doing duo you gain the currency which is a plus side as to h1z1 you play with a friend its a waste of time not gaining exprience. The gun play is very nice with a limited amounts of guns (hoping for more when it's out of early access) but is better than the standard h1z1 Ar and AK. The map is a vast in size but I don't mind it as I go for the areas with more buildings. It's hard for me to find a vehical but for others it's a breeze. One side note to all I recommend getting a good pc in order to play this cause the frame rate is if you don't have one. All in all the minor cons are somewhat easy to get by and this game is worth the 30 bucks right now or wait until the summer sale to get a better deal.Game got ruined by streamers.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-06-06,0,0,295,False,Recommended,So here's my basic review for PUBG. In its early stages of release(post full release) the game was great however with the most recent mega patch(players who have been with the game since its early beginning arrival on steam will understand) the game is unsteady. Everything that was core to the mechanics of the game is now completely upsidedown. So its a game I rarely touch now. However for new players finally jumping into the game I will say it will suck at first you will die more than you will win and sadly despite best efforts you will run into hackers. Although there's these issues the game is still fun for those who play with friends duos or squads makes the game worth playing from time to time despite how broken the game still is EVEN in full release. So that's my review. Take it as you will but it's true inside and out. Whether you're new to the game or you've been playing awhile its fun yes but will it survive? No I don't see this games fan base lasting.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-11-25,0,0,261,True,Recommended,Played this alot with friends through all stages of development. Pros * When playing with friends it can be hilarious and fun* Gunplay/Battles can be quite exillerating * Good way to waste time and neglet all of your adult responsibilitiesCons * Connection plays a huge role so while on your screen you are shooting at the person you may not be. Which isnt the games problem it just can be annoying* Bikes and Buggies can be quite frustrating to drive as they can flip and kill you off small bumps in the road. * This game is (sad to say) only fun when playing with multiple people in a squad. Due to how slow and boring it can be between battles.Overall Even though this game is still in Early Access there is alot of potential to create an amazing game. As long as they continue to listen to the community and act upon it the game will continue to grow. TBH just doing this review to finish the Steam Awards lol,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-06-30,0,0,150,True,Recommended,This game is kinda what DayZ intended to be in a fast paced scenario. It is fun to play if a potential early death in the game doesn't bother you (you can leave and rejoin pretty easily).Even more fun to play in a group of 2 or more then tactical thinking comes more into play solo is mostly finding the best spot and being a little lucky at aiming if you live long enough to be within the top10 it gets really intense and pulse rises!However this game IS STILL IN DEVELOPMENT! It is playable but still movement seems a bit notchy (on foot as well as in vehicles...especially in vehicles!!)hitboxes seem to be a little bit off texture (may be wrong I percieved it like that)only one map.

The wrost part is that i get sooooo many crates that need to be unlocked with keys and im not gonna pay for keys since I already payed $30 usd for it.

2018-06-20,0,0,334,False,Recommended,Great game. I feel the game is running pretty dang well now atleast for me and the team does seem like they care and are dealing with hackers pretty well. Better than CS GO imo anyway. It can be frustrating still some games of course because of the semi realistic nature of the game but thats what also makes the game and this genre kind of different and unique. I much prefer this over a game like fortnite because the adrenaline and anxiety that can come from this game. The gunplay is amazing as well and the best part of the game. The player base has quite a lot of degenerates and a holes though like in squads teams can rush you and one person on the flank can kill your whole squad which is annoying...RNG of course will always be a thing as well. I wish there were more vehicles in Miranmar as well and if they could shrink that map a bit it would make it a lot better imo the map has nice weapon spawns and good and interesting fights either in citiies or out in the mountains or whatever but its size is a bit much. Sanhok is really fun and a great map and look forward to its release hopefully they dont change it up too much.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-01,0,0,550,False,Not Recommended,Game is entertaining fun and worth the money however here are a list of reasons as to why i DON'T recommend the game.1) Paid crates in EA despite the opposite being promised. 2) The creator neither cares nor gives answers to questions surrounding South African Servers literally just doesn't care about us asking doesn't even give a goal to achieve. 3) Latency issues and server issues in game this is an early access well aware of it but that's no excuse for servers not having the performance this game has sold millions of copies they can afford to create a massive server bank for this game they just aren't.4) The map becomes a bit boring friend of mine has pretty much given up on the game because of the map and the latency issues.5) Doors opening and loot spawning late. I have had it so many times where you run into a building after glitching through the door you attempted opening 3 or 4 times only to find no loot so you go upstairs and find a dot site or whatever and on your way back down someone is looting an m416 or shotty off the floor in the same building you just checked thoroughly then blasts you into oblivion. In summary the creator doesn't care about you as the gamer latency in South Africa is a b$%#h Loot spawns slowly at times server lag is real and there seems to be little to no intention of fixing it. #GreeneCameForCashAndHasNowLeftTheBuilding,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-01-23,0,0,190,False,Not Recommended,This used to be a good game but its so riddled with cheaters that you can barely make top 10 unless you do nothing but hide the whole time. The Devs refuse to region lock China which is the source of most of the issues. And they don't really seem to give much effort when it comes to solving the issue. They throw a ban hammer down but after that you just see players killing you with names like A3rgth4rg so clearly they're using throw away accounts. They either need an anti cheat for this game or this game which sparked huge attention for battle royale games is gonna end up in the trash.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I don't mean to be racist or anything but the are SOOO many Asian people in the Ocieania servers are there any servers in Asia If there and please get some Save our Ears... The fact that Bluehole thought it was ready to come out of early access is astonishing. It runs like a Greasy Fat trying to go to a fast food restaurant. (It runs just very poorly). and crashes like Senior in a car having an epileptic fit. (abrubtly and out of the blue). and then Hackers. SO many of the ers in every siingle game.

2017-12-22,0,0,25,False,Not Recommended,It's fun for a little bit but after a while it just gets annoying. The only time it's really fun is when you're playing with friends and don't feel like taking anything seriously and just want to mess around. But when you do feel like playing seriously you'll just find yourself getting annoyed by being killed by some script kitty that kills from a mile away with a smg. And the loot boxes are just greedy lazy way to make a quick buck I would not recommend this game in it's current state unless you just want to mess around with friends but if you are looking for a game like that I would recommend totally accurate battlegrounds the silly physics and controls makes the experience way more fun than PUBG's.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Yea it has it's bugs here and there but nothing game breaking and yea being that it's still in a technical beta state you're going to have to occasional match with people running hack mods but if you can ignore how few and far between those things are then you'll find a fresh and completely fun new take on shooters with the battle royale style. Every game can go completely different than the last and there's no leg up that people with a thousand hours of play time will have over people with 1 hour of play time starting each and every match it's all just a matter of skill of survival which will is something you'll absolutely learn and get better at with each match played. 10/10 would recommend to everyone who's a fan of shooters and especially those that can adapt with what they have and play the long term survival aspect of each game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

They are greedy little looking for another quick buck while scared of a bigger game that is effectively taking all of their customers. I remember when I 1st started playing this game. I would get other english speaking squad mates. Now Im always squaded up with 0007770020 or xhichu or asd10002x100000 who happen to speak some form of chinese. Also the hit detection and server lag is horrendous. Getting tapped by a vehicle instantly downs you sometimes. Vehicles lose control seemly out of nowhere. Pick up a level 3 vest and helmet still get one shotted by someone who I shot over 10 times who happens to be wearing nothing but underwear. Sometimes get stuck in the sky from parachuting.

I had expected the pc version to be incredible compared to the xbox version but the countless bugs optimization issues lawsuit drama toxic playerbase and overall slow and boring solo expirience just make this game look like a pile of steaming garbage next to another battle royale game that I could be playing on pc. To translate how bad the optimization is on this game I get 60 fps with max settings and vsync on Realm Royale but on pubg at the absolute lowest settings with vsynce disabled I can't even hit 50. Not to mention the lotto gambling garbage that is the microtransactions. I don't mind microtransactions as a way of buisness but LOOTBOXES.

In one situation I was getting 18 FPS with my 1080 ti during a shootout. This is unacceptable. While I understand that people need time to develop more features are being added without consideration for the stability of the game.While people might argue that this is a ""Early Access Game"" they are currently on Version 3.7.30.8. Since PubG has now entered competition with Fortnight PubG are doing more and more kneejerk reactions to retain it's playerbase. The latest was an 8 Man Squad Play which was an absolute nightmare. So by expanding the capability gameplay suffered. Playing this game requires different ways to resolve the many technical issues with the game.In addition to this I would also like to point out that even though this game is quite popular at the moment. The playerbase is currently suffering with the many technical issues that are in the game.

Shotguns do not work at all. PlayerUnknown has no clue how to make this weapon. He does not possess the mental capability to even begin to comprehend how a shotgun works. Can't shoot people in water Start getting shot at make it 40 feet behind cover start healing and then die because of desync from a guy that can't even see you. 42 000 people banned for cheating daily. Its ridiculous how terrible the anti cheat is. You are literally going to die due to a cheater 7/10 times. Don't even think about getting on a bike. If you hit a bump going 15 mph you are going to die because your bike flipped and threw you 600 feet. SHOTGUNS DO NOT WORK. Grenades are complete and utter It takes 10 seconds to take a grenade out and then 5 seconds for your character to actually throw it. Reloading animation does not match up with when the gun is actually reloaded. Already introduced a pay to open crate even thought this game is still in alpha.

2018-03-31,0,0,100,False,Recommended,Introduction Playerunknown's Battlegrounds or known for short PUBG. Is a Battle Royale game with 100 people in the map. You can play Solo Duo 1 Man Squad 2 Man Squad 3 Man Squad 4 Man Squad. On 3 maps. One being 4x4. As the time of this review the 4x4 map is finally being tested soon. So in this I will talk about Mirmar the desert map and Erangel the soviet union grass map. My Stance PUBG is very fun. It can be very hard for new players that have no one to play with in Solo. Which is why I think 4x4 map will make the game better for newer players to get used to the game. As someone who plays Duos and 3 Man Squad most the time. The game is very fun and can be player up for hours every day and week. With Mirmar being my favorite map. This game is about waiting. Not to rush in the beginning of the game. During the last 30 players. This is the time where you should start playing and not to camp. As camping will screw you over. This game also is about looting and walking around the map till you run into other players. Which can be boring at time. The only problem is with hackers in the game but region lock is there to stop hackers to play on US servers. You can also customize your character and weapons. With clothing and weapon skins. Good Stuff Very Fun Being able to change character Weapon Skins Events Free Crates No Pay to Win system Bad Stuff Hackers To much walking and looting Hard to get used to when first playing Score 8/10,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

It is a nice mix of a game that makes you think before you act and one that makes the adrenaline pump through your bloodstream when you are one of the last alive.

The devs have done nothing that made the game worse. And if anything they've made it slightly better here and there.If you have friends you can play with this is one of the most fun competative multiplayer experiances you can have today. It has a winning formula that doesn't get old and there's a very high skill cap. Just like Counter Strike.I've got 200+ hours in CS GO as well and I have to say I like this better. The firefights are intense and tactical but at other times you can also goof around a little without it drastically reducing your teams chance of winning.A lot of people are complaining about hackers but in my 200 hours i've only been killed by hackers 2 times that I know of.

2018-04-15,0,0,82,False,Not Recommended,This game can be fun. It can. But mostly it's not. Crap servers. Crap optimization. Crap everything really. But can be fun with friends. Other games however can be more fun with friends. I am sick and tired of dying in this game through no fault of my own. When I die it is usually because I kept shooting a guy in the back of the head and the game denied me to hit for some reason then he just spins right around after noticing the 25th bullet whizzing by his head and then just sprays 7 bullets right in my face. Fun. Superb. Anything but close range engagements I find it hard as F to hit a damn thing. Not because I suck because the game does. So poorly optimized it must be a joke. But people keep buying it and they keep making money like crazy so why should they improve the game? They don't have to. They'll make tons of money wether they do or not. Instead of actually fixing anything they make minor pointless tweaks to the game. Which are just simple code re writes that take a few seconds to do. Then release these things months apart as if they actually did something to improve the game. Which they didn't. They just tweaked it slightly in a way akin to changing a few numerical values in notepad.Would not recommend this game. IT's hyped up like crazy. You might even enjoy it a little. But is it fun to loot for ages get good gear then have it stripped away from you by a guy that you ambush miss with two magazines and he then sees where you are and just insta headshots you while all your bullets flew off in any other direction than where you were actually F'ing aiming? I say no. I say this pisses me off. Dying and lsoing because the game is bad not because I am is annoying as heck. If I sucked and I died then I deserved it. If my aim is on point I ambush a guy and fire off 60 rounds into his chest/head area and none for some reason hit that is not ok. And that's pretty much this game in a nutshell.It's a cool concept but by no means original. Battle Royale came out what in the 90's? So 20 years later they had this great idea to make a game that is basically the same thing! Shockingly fresh breath of air right there. So creative and new. ......Don't get it. Please. If I could un get it I would and get my money back from the devs. They don't deserve your money. For your money you deserve a better game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Now hear me out.This game is absolutely wonderful and has a lot of potential so dont get me wrong.I also enjoy playing it on a daily basis and I don't even know why there is just something about getting geared up looting and looting and looting until you finally find the freaking weapon or the attachement you wanted up until your dream setup is complete and you finally beeing ready to battle.But in my 70 hours of playing this game still counting I haven't gotten a single win in solo neither duo or squad even though duo and squad is a lot more communicative and especially is way more fun than playing alone in my opinion.Because you 'tend to just get frustrated in solo.Think about it this is how every game goes atleast for me You jump out of the plane go to a nearby hangar or building or whatever get a gun get ammunition etc. just gear up run for the zone and then literally just out of nowhere someone comes up to you who is just 10.000 times better than you and shoots you in the freaking head.Game over better luck next time!And the thing is you can't do anything about it I mean you can try spazzing out and start dancing or wiggling out so he doesn't hit you but in the end he will freaking hit you and you're going to be tilted.It's always the same and I don't even know what to say or what to improve 'cause the game itself is wonderful and I have a blast playing it with friends but from my perspective maybe it's because I'm new to the kind of ""war"" or ""battlegrounds"" kinda games maybe it's because I'm bad who knows.But for me it's just that everybody is better than you no matter what even if I tend to get to the top 10 I never had the chance of winning the slightest cause the people are just sweating so hard.That's just my opinion but I still recommend this game 'cause if you're good at those kind of games get it!It's really fun beeing good I guess.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-05-31,0,0,609,False,Recommended,After seeing all the negative reviews I felt compelled to leave my opinion of the game. First it seems most of the negative reviews are related to either item trading OR the lawsuit against Fortnite. Politics aside reviews should be about the game itself and not what's going on outside legally. This doesn't adversely affect your gameplay. Great. Now that we've covered that let's talk about the game. This game is without a doubt the best $30 I have spent on a game in a long time. I started playing in Early Access and have enjoyed watching the game grow and add new features weapons vehicles customization and events. It's also a great game to watch on Twitch with the Doc Shroud Viss or even Break. The game has issues sure but all games do. I find they do well to resolve issues quickly and make balance changes each new update. After reading through a lot of the reviews I can't help but get the feeling that a lot of the negativity stems from either an inadequate PC build or someone who hasn't practiced enough to feel competitive. That isn't reflective of the games enjoy ability but rather your ability to get better and practice. I can't think of a game that has kept me entertained this long for only $30. Jumping in first person with your squad is always entertaining. Maybe you get a good drop or maybe RNG slaps you in the face. Regardless you can jump right back in and try again.

2017-05-31,0,0,801,False,Not Recommended,I enjoyed PUBG despite it's flaws for a long time but I just can't do it anymore.The cosmetic system is abysmal. While the crate system in place has potential to make someone a lot of money the drop rates are so horribly skewed that you're guaranteed to line the pockets of PUBG Corp in exchange for a few Zest White Turtlenecks that go a few pennies on the Steam Market. This game is the slot machine at the local casino that no one plays because all the other machines provide a more rewarding experience. The developers need to learn that it's not about winning big. It's about winning enough along the way to keep people interested in the big win.Hit detection is a joke plain and simple. I forgave this for a long time because the game was a work in progress but over a year later bullets still hit around corners. Want to hit someone with a melee weapon? You'll be lucky if one out of five swings hits the target even if the target isn't moving. Grenades can be rendered completely useless by a thin leg to a shelving unit. Some fences can't be shot through or can only be shot through from one side.

Faulty textures that will also make you lag and recieve errors.(Mostly at the start of the game) Buggy Cars (like in all Battle Royal games...for some reason) Sometimes you won't get past the start screen (Servers full / Connection Failed) Sometimes the game freezes on you (usually after you get fully geared up and are ready to smash) The ammount of times your shots wont hit the dude will trigger the living out of you. The Hit Registry is the worst thing ive seen in any game so far. The obvious one you wont be able to avoid the game HEAVILY relies on luck in the early game sometimes you will loot everything you could possibly need and terminate every no pants wearing dude trying to find literally anything that shoots.Or you are the no pants wearing dude trying to find anything that shoots while running away from gun shots coming closer and closer and eventually kill your dumb and you rank #90 Most of the times I die is actually behind the wall or inside a house the desync IS INSANE in pubg it's beyond repair...ALRIGHT those were the cons now to the pros.+ Can acctually be alot of fun with friends when the things above dont take place.+ The feeling when you bamboozle your enemy or win a game is amazing+ Really gets your adrenaline goingWho thought 31$ would be a justified price tag for this rage enducing thing called H1Z1?Now last but not least everytime I discuss literally any game or make a point about any game angry kids will write ""you're just bad hnnngg Xdd you suck ballsack"" and think they've won an argument or some I'm currently Top 0.09% on the EU Ladder in TPP Duo which is around rank #1100 https //pubg.op.gg/user/LordSabo?server euhttps //www.youtube.com/watch?v u0dWDFDUF8shttps //www.youtube.com/watch?v Gsde3uuZD8",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-01-17,0,0,1076,False,Recommended,One of the hottest fps action games in the market recently. Based on the battle royale concept from Fornite Battle Royale PUBG works on a different touch. Omitting the special abilities PUBG relies on player's aiming skills hand eye coordination and ability to distinguish distance and location of footsteps in the game. Those are the fundamental capabilities that work across every battle mode in the game solo duo or squad.Parachuted into a map of 6 km by 6 km your own survival relies on your own skills teamwork &amp communication and perhaps followed by a small percentage of luck. The intense competition starts at the second you land on the ground. Finding the best locations for best possible loots of various armories protective armors and vehicles. Each single decision will define the end result of your survival.PUBG is a highly competitive game while for solo mode sounds tough playing as duo or squad does also challenge us into many different aspects. Loot sharing will not only help you in the game but as well as in the community. Communication lies deeply when playing duo or squad as every bit of intel or information is critical or important. Navigating through the map pin point enemy location supply drop to finding cover locations are also the abilities you need to practice. The bullets' travel time and bullet drop are just two of various factors each player should learn by experience. Unlike some of other FPS titles PUBG has a more complex physics in term of long range shooting. Each weapon has their own unique characteristics and bullet drop. Distance matters. How far your target from your location and where you put your crosshair on the enemies will define your final fate in the game.The intensity of the game also relies on how you handle emotion and ego. Your playstyle most likely will change from round to round or even in a round you have to be able to adjust yourself well. The pace will change every single time a new round starts. Players are required to read the situation and adjust the pacing from rushing to taking over planning a flank or even fleeing/retreating.Patience is also a virtue in this game. Tho the pacing would be fast being patient does reward you in the long run. It will give players more ability and space to adjust and reconstruct their playstyle. Being in a squad there are some traits you have to have such as adaptable to different tactics or strategies. All in all PUBG asks and lets players to explore their best capabilities to conquer the map for each round. This includes to adapt playing in a group. Players will be rewarded with BP for each damage they deal to any enemies including killing the enemies. This will then be able to be exchanged with crates in which will give the players some cosmetic items from head gears to footwears. Some have high value in the Steam Market due to the rarity and equipping your toon with some of the items also shows some exclusive pride. While some players might not have significant interests in doing so.The community is great with so many veteran players enjoy sharing their experiences and tips. Suggestions and feedbacks are widely welcomed. On the personal level this is one of the FPS games that has a pretty low level of trollings or trash talking.If you enjoy playing FPS with unlimited possibilities of fun PUBG has everything to offer.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-06-01,0,0,900,False,Not Recommended,Do not buy this game!!!!I bought this game back in Feb 2018 It worked fine till end of March after that the game sometimes would just crash and turn off my Laptop. I thought it was a heat problem but my temps never would go over 60 deg C. I tried tuning everything to get it to work. I could not understaned with computer stats that I have that I would have a problem running this game. My computer is a i7 7700 with 1050 gtx 4gb and 16gb ram. It then worked for half of april and may then the last week of May it would crash every game. I do believe the problem lies with the patchs everytime a big patch ie. over 5 gb there was a problem with it crashing. The last major patch was 8gb. I also find it wierd that there are sometimes 3 4 patchs a day. They also whould have these huge patchs for little fixes such as placement of weapons or addition of weapons. They are most likey trying to fix the game. That shows that there are a lot of problems with the game that they are constantly fixing. The surver downtime would be at prime playing time 7pst not the middle of the night. I am not happy with this game as it was paid for to only play it for 2 1/2 months with no problems and since I played it for more than 2 hours I can't get my money back and I am stuck with a game that might work.

'Oh this game is so bad they worked 1 month on a bit of hotfixes' this right here just pisses me off be happy that they are doing patches and not like DayZ where they are almost doing no updates/adding content. And people saying that there are only hotfixes in this monthly patch? Let me give you a quick recap New UI FOV Slider MK14 First Person only servers bug fixes crates. And who the hell still cares about the crates CSGO has it and people spend thousands of dollars on crates aswell and nobody cares and PUBG adds it and everybody instantly cares they added the crates to fund the upcoming Gamescom Tournament that is coming and people telling that they made so much money with sales. Let me tell you that creating new weapons and gear is really expensive and a couple of million sales are not gonna cut it. If you want to support the game after it is fully released go and buy crates you don't have to and you do not get an advantage from this. So people please stop ing about the fact that they worked on a MONTHLY patch for month. I am not changing my review buy the game while you can and let the H1Z1 crap in the garbage.EDIT 2 Haha i was saying that i was not gonna change my review right. Oh boy i was so wrong. The game has turned to total with the last update not because of the microtransactions but because of the server performance. It is garbage shooting people in the face 15 times with a m4 apparantly doesn't kill people. Hitboxes are so bad that it is so unplayable this is no fun. Focus on the ing hitboxes and not weapons i rather have better hitboxes/server performance then this t where you are not even near a car and still get run over. And can someone tell me why the hell people can one shot me with the shotgun while i cant (Hitting them right in the face should ing let your head explode.) At this point do not buy the game. People are gonna complain that it is early access? off they already could have fixed the hitboxes patches ago. I repeat do not buy this game. (I have enough hrs in this game to know wtf is wrong with it),PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-03-24,0,0,338,False,Not Recommended,EDIT 1/18/2018My previous review is below and everything below still stands it runs even better than it used to now. HOWEVER..... This game is FILLED with Asians. I mean if you que up for duo or squads with random 8/10 times it will be with an Asian. Maybe even 9/10. Let me explain why this is bad for everyone. Asians are on the other end of the world they LAG and a ton you can't understand them because they don't speak english and worst of all most of them HACK on this game.Hackers are on the rise. I've encountered at least two a day for the last 4 days. Up until then I had only ever encountered one as far as I know. Asians have their own ing servers I don't ing understand why they don't play on them. Until this game region locks Asians and updates their anti cheat STEER CLEAR OF THIS GAME!OLD REVIEW I've only had this game for a day and I'm already addicted. This game puts all the other battle royale games to shame ESPECIALLY H1Z1. That game is a literal piece of garbage compared to this game in every way. This game has more guns better gun play no RNG T no bleeding nice handling cars. I can run this game maxed out (including anti aliasing) on a 980ti and a 4790k with a minimum of 60 fps. Don't listen to the people with potatoes for pcs. If you've been looking for a better game like H1 but with less t this is the game for you!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-06-07,0,0,191,False,Recommended,The game definitely started out way stronger and more promising than it is in this current state. Although PUBG's major fallout was to Fortnite I believe to this day PUBG was far superior. And although I have to hand it to Fortnite for staying on top of updating and somewhat adhering to what the community wanted. I must agree though that at some point PUBG lost it's touch. I must say though that the developers are somewhat getting back on track hence why I gave the positive recommendation. I do also believe that the mechanics of the game took a dip and still need to be improve. However the overall amount of bugs occuring in the game have decreased and for that I have to hand it to PUBG.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-20,0,0,353,True,Recommended,AFTER u read this review. If u are new about this gamemode u just ing need this game....NOW. But if u come from H1Z1... u little poor kid leave that game and buy this. What we do in this game ?About 100 to 90 players in an airplane that cut the island randomly. Jump. Now YOU are alone against 99 players. Look for guns bagpacks AMMO medikit gadget for your gun. Ok u are ready to survive. Oh... wait there is a circle. If u are out from it u wil slowly gonna die. ...quick..look for a car..or for a motorbike...or GODDD u cant find it ?!? Than FUCING RUN NOW to the ING circle or u gonna die. Are you finally in ? it isnt finished yet. There are players looking for YOUR head. Whats your plan ? Stay hide ? or play aggressively ? its your style that guide you to the TOP 10 . The circle is getting smaller and smaller. The players are near to you. Every usless moviment will decide u if being dead or a winner.Hope you got it what you have to do in this game. Coz ...god i spent 5 h after downloaded the game without stopping.Heres the info. about this game to let u decide if buy or not this game.The game is growing up faster than what u think They are setting bugs reported by the players so the staff is realy active with the players.The things that needs to win a game is luck(obvsly) tattics aim and FU***NG SELFCONTROL. The stress that gives you the game when u are on top 10 is bigger than what u think. And Its realy sutisfing winning . AUDIO Its realy important having a surround Headset.The sound of every gun is clearly different and getting a silencer is like being completely unspotted.The steps ... here is an important part of the game wich make the difference about killing or get killed.GRAPHIC Nothing special. Dont even think is . In my opinion . more realistic would be too havey for the HD or SSD.GAMEPLAY Nothing more that just ONE OFFICIAL gamemode. Take care about the word OFFICIAL coz there are servers (didnt joined yet) with different gamemodes.In the official u can also play in solo or duo servers that means that u play only against others players in duo. Or also in a team of 5 players.( if with your frinds arent enigh for 5 the team will be completed randomly with an another palyer that selected 5 players mode)It was a TPS game wich u can switch to the FPS. Subsequently they added the FPS ONLY gamemode.MARKET do u know Counter Strike ? Ok same Get money in game by playing enogh to buy the cases ( NOT WITH REAL MONEY ). 2 kinds of cases. One need a key (getting it with real money) or the case for poor players like me the case that u can just open without anything else just buy it and open it. Every single object u get fron the case u can sold it on market and also buy it from there.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Their are also problems such as lag issues unreliable servers Very poor comunication between developers and players and many bugs. They also only have reporting options for older hacks and problems. The game has a tendancy to crash at the worst possible times and my recored for most crashes in a single game are three.

This is the first ever time I have reviewed a game.I want to start off and say yes I understand this game is in EA.However the developers have given a rough date for the full release (coming out of EA) as later this year in December.This game is far from ready for full release 1) Game crashes2) Unresponsive actions at times (opening a door and waiting 3 seconds for it to open)3) Buggy movement (jumping jump crouching etc...)4) STILL AN UNOPTIMISED GAME4.1) Heavy framerate issues on high end machines (Mine is an i7 7700 MSI GTX1080 16GB Corsair DDR4 and I get a constant 40 FPS when there's no action around me. Whenever I look at the city Yasnaya my frames drop to around 15 20 which frankly is abysmal. If I'm lucky I might get a spike up to 45 55 FPS but that's really rare)4.2) Textures occasionally take 20+ seconds to load even after landing on the ground. My textures once didn't load and I could run through walls and shoot through walls and then when they did load I was stuck in a filing cabinet lolFor these reasons I don't think this game is worth the price tag.Once the game can run on high settings with a solid 90+ frames like all my other ones then I'll change this review to a positive.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-15,0,0,420,False,Not Recommended,First off I m not just some random guy that has 2 hrs played and complains that their pc can t run it. I have 360 hrs played as I write this review and I m going to be discussing the pros and the cons in this game.Pros Decent graphics Very fun game with friends The best battle royal out there *fortnite is for little children that watch ninja and dr lupo* If ur above the age of 10 years old and still play fortnite then there is something wrong with you. I suggest u seek help ASAP. Constant updates from the devs I paid 40$ for this game back in May of last year and they have added new guns a new map redesigned UI gameplay changes and many other cosmetic items. Currently they are working on a new 4X4 map that should be released very soon sometime this month. Also they have a 8X8 map planned for late this year. Loot boxes I like this idea in this game because it keeps funding the game for future map updates etc... The loot boxes in this game aren t pay to win like in EA's Star Wars battlefront 2. They are purely cosmetics but the funny part is I m not even tempted to buy them since the odds of getting something worth more than 3 cents is very very very rare. Steam achievements very good addition to the game. The game runs very well right now as long as you meet the min requirements you should be fine. This game is very CPU/GPU heavy so don t try and play this game with a i3 from 2010. As long as you don t be a idiot and have decent hardware 770 1050 1060's 960 970 etc... paired with a decent i5 you should be able to run this game at a constant 60 FPS at high settings. When this game launched back in March of 2017 I used to get 45 fps and frequent dips to the 15's on my GTX 980ti and i7 6700K this has now been fixed every patch they bring improves the performance in this game. My pc gets a solid 120 fps at high on 1080P with this current setup. SO if you see anyone complaining about performance they must have an old cpu or an old gpu and they don t understand how their setup sucks and they should upgrade asap if they want to play modern games.Cons Hackers wall hackers speed hackers panda tv hackers chingy chingy chongs ruining the leaderboards with their hacks. You could be minding your own business when a comes flying out of nowhere comes in your house leans and destroys you in less than a second you can be at the other end of the map and a can get a 3000M snipe on you. The anti cheat in this game is a joke and 99% of the hackers come from china. I don t understand why these s must come to other servers and ruin their games. Blueballs I suggest region locking the game when I click on the NA server I expect to play with other Na players and not some ching in their internet cafe hacking away. The AA is this game is so that on the old map you have trouble seeing people unless u run the game at ultra low. The grass is all pixelated on max settings and if someone is prone in a bush or in the grass it s almost impossible to see them. Sometimes it gets even worse if they are behind a tree. The cars in this game are a joke when you are driving them they for no reason could explode without you knowing or they will spin out of control and smash you on the group leading to you losing most of your health or exploding yourself. Blue hole needs to fix their car physics. Why does the mobile version of PUBG have better car physics then the actual pc game? LASTLY THIS IS A BIG ISSUE the SOUND MANAGMENT and the MOVMENT SYSTEM IN PUBG. The sound in this game is a joke if you don t buy a third party accessory called headphones it s almost impossible to hear people in this game unless you have your speakers at max volume blowing out your ears and the neighbors that live around you. Plz improve your sound this is one aspect that fortnite does right. Fornites sound is balanced perfectly you can hear people that are around you or in your house perfectly other sounds such as guns and drops aren t blowing out your ear drums. Second point is why the FK IS THE GUNS AND PLANE SO LOUD in pubg. FIX THE FKIN VOLUME PLZ ITS A MESS. Last point is the clunky af movement system. It uses the same movement as gta 5 when you press spring it takes fkin 5 year for your character to start winding up to sprint and when you want to stop... oh good luck. Vaulting is a mess it sometimes works it sometimes doesn t. Movement in general needs a lot of work.To sum things up this game is a very fun battle royal it s even better with friends. I would say its currently the best battle royal out there since the genera in general is pretty and no one knows how to make a good battle royal these days. The graphics are decent and the gunplay is ok. There is many t moments where you load a entire clip on a person and not kill him while he just clicks on you once and gets a lucky head shot this happens a lot but that normal since the guns in this game are RNG unlike fornite whose guns are actually accurate. The cheaters in this game are getting out of control. Alongside the cheaters you have to worry about your movement bugging out the sound blowing out your ears and the AA not allowing you to see anyone around you on the old map. So until they fix their game unfortunately I cannot recommend at the moment. It should still be in early access since these are key features that should have been addressed day one.I just realized that this review is 1070 words long. D,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-05-02,0,0,726,False,Not Recommended,Incredibly fun game I've followed the development through early access since last April and they have made a ton of improvements to the game since then however they've absolutely failed to refine the game to where players expectations are of games in 2018 (whether those expectations are warranted or not is not being discussed here).They certainly haven't been able to execute a generally acceptable micro transaction model for the game with BP directly purchasable items and the randomized loot from both BP and the crates.

While this can mean the most aggressive player wins it is by far not the average case. Knowing when to engage and when to lay low is key in having your first chicken dinner.PUBG rewards an active playstyle. Just as much as being too aggressive will probably get you killed being too passive will mean your opponents will have more and more of a tactical advantage through their gear.Making use of the ingame sound can make all the difference. Knowing where shots are fired where cars are driven and listening to that all too careless player stomping around in his punk boots all make for a great way to either engage on your terms or make sure you dont engage at all.Know your strengths and weaknesses. While most players would love to excel in every aspect of the game every player has their own strengths and weaknesses. Be aware of what you are capable of and make sure the situations you get yourself in favor your strengths and avoid your weaknesses.Make use of every distraction. Sometimes you are pinned behind cover with no way out or you know where an enemy is but can't get close without them seeing you. In those cases using grenades is not your only option. Make use of the red zone of the impending blue circle of nearby gunfire your teammates or even the loud sound of the airplane to get out of a bad situation or into a good situation. Oftentimes your opponent wont be able to track your movement.Playing soloAs a solo player you will always have some blind spots. While some positions will allow you to make sure no one sneaks up to you as soon as you are in the open field you will often have to rely on knowing where other players are probably going to be. Always keep track of how far the blue circle is where the new white circle is and how likely it is that someone is behind you.Since you have no team to rely on a single unsuppressed shot even if it kills someone can lead to your death. Players around your position will have a vague idea of where you are while you probably don't know where they are. It is rarely advised to kill someone while completely exposed even if your target is ""an easy kill.""Playing duo/squadWhen playing with a team it is important to make sure that all players have the same gameplan. Some players enjoy playing fast and ending rounds quickly while others have a more tactical approach and aim for the endgame. If the team does not follow the same gameplan the players will oftentimes not work as a team. Further players need to work as a team. Players that 'wander off from the tour group' are exposing themselves and their team to higher risk.When playing with a team you can make sure all angles are secure at all times. This however requires communication. Make sure you use voice chat (or other methods of communication) to alert your teammates whenever something important is happening around you. Use the in game compass (or notable site names) to inform your team where and what is happening.An early death of a teammate does not automatically mean a round is lost and dying early yourself can be a great opportunity to learn from your teammates. If you are really not interested in watching the rest of the match when dead maybe do something else until the match is finished. Ranting will only inhibit your team even further.How to kill enemiesBATTLEGROUNDS puts you right in the fray and because of this it might be hard to take down players. There's three basic techniques you can use though dependent entirely on your style that can make you an absolute juggernaut.Ranged fireFirst and foremost is the ranged fire technique. This uses weapons with scopes to pick off distant enemies. Wait until your enemies are moving away from you in a clear line to open fire as this will remove most areas for them to hide giving you the most chance to deal major damage. Right click once for scope view hold right mouse click for general zoom view.A big part of this strategy is the idea of the vantage point. Vantage points are areas on the map that are higher ground than the rest or otherwise give you more and better opportunities for aiming and firing. Second floors of buildings tall hills and wooded areas are all examples of great vantage points as they give you a clear sight of the land and the ability to pick off enemies at range.Close and LoudClose and Loud is the principle of engagement where you fire on an enemy in quick sudden bursts after disabling them in some other fashion. This can include using gas grenades or flash bangs and then turning around corners to lay down heavy fire and other such techniques. The big goal here is to disorient your enemies making them confused and thus ineffective.High capacity weapons are important here as you're going to need every shell and cartridge to carry out these sorts of attacks. Keep in mind that a very important part of your loadout is the sidearm as it will allow you to put down resistance even when you've run out of primary ammunition.WaitPerhaps the best combat strategy is one not even of combat just wait. Because you're in a pool of many players you can essentially wait out the clock letting players kill each other before swooping in with one of the other techniques and clearing the area that way. This is a good technique but keep in mind that as the game progresses the battle area shrinks giving you fewer options for vantage points and assaults.Playing the mapA big part of BATTLEGROUNDS is playing the map. Understanding the general concept of where people are likely to go how to move silently and so forth are key to your long term survival.Moving silentlyIn BATTLEGROUNDS everyone wants to kill you literally. With enemies on every side all bearing down on you the ability to move throughout the map without attracting unwanted attention is incredibly valuable. Here are some tips to keep in mind that'll help you to this end Not everyone needs to be engaged. Firing your weapon alerts everyone as to your location and if you see an enemy who is particularly well equipped in a vehicle or simply in a bad spot to fire on don't fire on them. Track them and follow until they are in a vulnerable location or alignment with their surroundings before opening fire. A well placed grenade against an enemy in a building who you've been tracking will kill with a single loud shot as opposed to using a machine gun or assault rifle that will attract attention for your entire area.Move from cover to cover. Almost every path in BATTLEGROUNDS is lined with cover in the form of trees rocks or buildings. Moving through and between them is hazardous in the sense that you might not see trouble coming but it also severely restricts enemy vision and their ability to engage. Limiting attention and visibility in this way will make your movement easier.Be aware. When you hear gunshots even from afar move to cover immediately. Do not line up to the line of sight of people in the distance because you don't know their weapon ranges. If you hear vehicles coming get to cover if you see a single vehicle consider an ambush if they are going slow but default to grenades before engaging in light arms combat.Choke points and high traffic areasThere are a few areas of the map that are high traffic and should largely be avoided. These areas can cause you to be ambushed by multiple players each looking for resources as well so you need to wait and see whether or not the threat is worth the possible reward. These areas include most towns buildings bridges and the military base. While items will spawn here more often they attract players and thus raise the danger to new levels.This is a good and bad thing though. While the danger is indeed heightened it also means you have a good spot to set up ambushes and create choke poit",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-05-01,0,0,86,False,Recommended,I would recommend it but not for the current price. Bit choppy gun sounds are unrealistic cameras could be improved.

Is it perfect? No. No game is but as far as balance it would say it is very well balanced. Note I don't say realistic but balanced as in all the guns have a niche with streghts and weaknesses. The vehicles are balanced to do different things well.

2017-10-31,0,0,438,False,Not Recommended,I once gave this game a thumbs up. seeing the potential of it.However after having played this game for over half a year I must now change that to a thumbs down.There are still good things with this game of course but a LOT of things that are negative aswellFirst the pros * Addictive* The graphics still do look pretty decent (depending on where you look more on that in the cons)* Most of the guns feel pretty good and look pretty good.* Realism* A good conceptAnd now to the main cons * Pretty communication with the playerbase It's community the is not very helpful at all (been rude and more) the game in general is getting worse rather than better they don't listen to what their community want's the most OPTIMIZATION* This game Runs at 60 fps with a GTX 1060 on LOW which makes the game feel kinda considering it's graphics aren't that great (not bad either though)* Some textures still look like for example the stones. * Some weapons like the shotguns are complete . They are very unbalanced still* The servers SUCK. This makes the tickrate low which leads to a very bad player experience. For example when I shoot someone they might already have moved on the servers side which leads to the bullets not registering.My final rating of this game is 4/10,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-05-14,0,0,176,True,Recommended,"Another one hour review this time PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDSA quick summary A very well done KIng of the Hill game.Has its roots in the Battle Royal mod for ARMA 3 but is more fast paced and viscious. The Unreal engine renders the environment in gorgeous detail without bogging down a semi powerful computer so much.Fast games that are over in 20 minutes also possibility to play in 2 or 4 men team makes it a nice coop as well.The cons with the game in its current state is that is an Early Access which means a bit unstable behaviour some people has big problems with drop in FPS and there are occasionaly a lot of rubber banding.But overall I must recommend it really fun and has that ""just one more time"" appeal.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Sanhok seems like the make it or break it map for this game with shorter game times smaller map more loot quicker zone times etc... these are all great changes to not only keep the game fresh but to make gameplay more fun. The game is still the best at what it sets out to do. Here is the inexcusable part...they still have not optimized the game well enough servers still struggle still tons of glitches still lots of hackers still feels clunky and don't get me started on the lootboxes...the time spent on fixing the game instead of on cosmetics and this game would be a masterpeice. But.....""sigh""... this is where we are today with PUBG. A game ruined by the massive success and wealth of the devs and the lack of motivation to make a better and better game. Thus the steam reviews mirror that.OG post Best early release game ive played in a long time. Hope they add an ELO system and different divisions and rankings.

I have a decent rank in solo duo and squad FPP so it's still enjoyable.Having player community hosted servers that perhaps didn't reward BP/Rank but could have custom rules join password. would greatly add replay value and offload stress and costs from the official servers without hurting BP.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-06-11,0,0,222,False,Not Recommended,So i liked the game for the first 170 or so hours. I especially liked joining my friends for a squad game and working our way to the win. And even after 20 or so wins you still get hyped to win because you worked for it. When i later moved to fortnite i didnt get hyped after winning 20 or so games because the games are short and you can just start a new game and get to the action quick. But the problem is just what i gave the game credit for. It's horrible looting system. Imaging finding a weapon. But still having to loot for scopes extended mags and more. It's amazing when you fight to the very end but that rarely happens because you die to hackers with all your loot and you turn of the game. It's so so boring when you time and time again land a good spot and die due to just having that AR but not all the extra clips scopes and so on. I did actually want to give the game credit but thats just not possible in the current state of the game. But then again that looting system is somewhat of their thing.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-05-31,0,0,200,False,Not Recommended,OH PUBG......... good game for 30$ USD it is an okay price. PUBG is a battle royal that takes releastic factors into play Maybe not the level ad Escape From Tarkov but it has the essentialls and meats in a way where it has realistic features to non realistic. This game when it wasent blown up and not as mainstream it was a great game and can hopefully can stay in that direction of being good and popular.But being popular isnt the best for this game before official release this game was really good updates once a week test server that ran better than the real servers.Now its a mess first off railings just a bugged mess atm seems so simlpe but it is not the way bullets go through fences/railings is bugged on bolth sides depending on the circumstances.Hackers Dont get me started my first comment is that It is REALLY bad atm unless your high elo or really good at the game. I have multiple video clips of me getting killed by hackers im not just calling people who kill me hackers.... legitamet hackers. I have been shot through walls shot fully auto from 300+ meters away ive seen people with no recoil (this games recoil is arguably what makes the game difficult.) Ive seen increased damage (ex. beibng plae to do more damage with 5.56 then usual or even ignoring armour.) I plan on making a comp of hackers that i experienced so far ones i think that are truely hacking.Next off optimization if you dont have a 1k usd pc your game is going to run like dirt sometimes you will get 100 fps in the open and when in dence cities with alot of people you will drop but when in test server you wont feel these affects as bad.Cheat engine It needs a TON of work a cheat engione that cant calculate where you are and where the enemy is and notice that its inpossible for you to get shot from an angle that hass full cover is just bad imo ( i say this in the instance where i meet someone wall bang me like it was R6 seige which you cant shoot through walls in this game) All around the mechanics and the weapons this game is great for the community and hackers it makes the game bad. people in the lobby waiting just yells N***** over and over and hackers are all over low to mid elo in TPP Wrapping it all up i like the game it has huge potential and blue hole is the only one who can save this if they put as much effort as fortnite is doing it would be an amazing game. as for hackers they need to be dealt with more seriously quicker and efficiently. Every time i play i encounter at least one.UPDATE a year an a half later nothing has chanfged besides jelousy over fortnite and adding skins in box that require time and money to open oh and a new map still nothing fixed,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I've played hundreds if not thousands of matches since the game entered early access and I can count the number of times I've encountered a hacker on ONE HAND! I'm sure there are hackers about but they're nowhere near as prevalent as these other reviews suggest. The only other big complaint I see is about having to purchase keys with real money to unlock loot crates you get by playing. I won t try and defend this it's incredibly scummy of the developer especially considering how they USED TO BE FREE before they realised they could cash in.

Not sure if its a better attempt at what Dayz started or if I prefer Dayz although both seem to be in the same catagory of unfinished possibly neverendingly unfinished and buggy. What annoys especially with a game I dont care much to play anymore after all this is the constant massive updates and then the recent addition of the 26.2 mb update every 4 hours it seems not sure if this 26.2mb update is just needed every 4 hours to fix something the developers messed up with one of the daily 9 GB patches you have for the game. They update so much with the game so often they lose track of where they messed up what it seems.

2018-01-11,0,0,329,False,Recommended,The game is fun and runs well for the most part. A few minor bugs but most games have those on launch.If you're hesitant to buy it because of the mixed reviews you can ignore any complaints about lag and rubberbanding it's been patched and is rare and modest enough that it won't be an issue. I'm NA playing NA servers mostly but I never really felt lagged on EU or AS servers either which is great for anyone playing with friends from all over.Admittedly the chinese are everywhere. Not all are hackers but you'll see enough at the moment to make jokes about it. My advice buy the game play it have fun rage quit sometimes rinse and repeat the fun/rage cycle to your hearts content.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-01-11,0,0,379,False,Not Recommended,Don't get me wrong it has its moments of pure joy. Winning a Chicken Dinner is a great feeling but mostly this game is a looting/walking simulator. Gunplay is ok it's nothing to write home about especially considering how buggy it can be. Generally gunfights happen in the first few minutes of landing or the last few minutes of the game. MIdgame is a boring snoozefest and since there's no way to practice with weapon handling bullet drop etc outside of joining in a game it turns into a waste of time. Just watch highlights from Twitch streamers and save the $30.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-01-11,0,0,323,False,Recommended,Pretty good game overall with minor cons which are constantly being fixed by the developers. This game has made a great title as it shot up in the steam charts and now everyone is playing it. I highly recommend this game however the main downside is perfomance due to its advanced newer Unreal Engine. Due to this mostly fps sits at around 60 80 and that is a perfect framerate to play at. However the community is great fun aswell as amazingly funny. Genuinely enjoy this game and hope to see me content come out as the game pursue's its path for victory (Or chicken dinner to the player!),PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-02-02,0,0,348,False,Not Recommended,"As a concept this game is amazing PUBG seems to have lit a fire that has quite a few developers scrambling to create thier own battle royale title. Its fast paced and competitve and somewhat satisfying to play and for that matter win. As a complete title I would highly recommend it to almost anybody I know...However the developers seem to have turn this ship of the course of sucess the game is in official release now and is still plagued but hackers glitches de sync and crashes. On top of all those thing the devs have made changes to the core mechanics for the worse. The loot spawn rate has gotten excedingly worse in an attempt to make the game ""more fair"" they have infact done the opposite. When I first started playing I could go into a small two story and find twoor even three AKs stacked on top of eachother (which is I agree ridiculus) but now I have to search two of three buildings to find a pistol. I get RNG but this is just bad judgment the game is hard enough to play with de sync/server side lag but I'm expected to fight with a pistol against some dude who has a kitted M4 16 seconds into the game. Evensome of the pro players have said this game isn't esports ready and because the general public is so used to recieving have finished games as full products people have just said ""Screw it its awesome!"" There is still a lot that needs fixing before this game is considered at all viable to be competitive.Now a lot of people have stated that it takes time and that you can't just through money at the problem. Well they are half right the game has been out for sometime now and pre alpha alpha and beta are where you make sure the game runs properly. Any gamer can forgive poor appearence as long as the game functions as its supposed to hence why people love fortnite the game runs. PUBG however has not made a ton of improvement again the most grave sins being the server side lag and hackers. They have made easily a billion dollars on a title that maybe cost 50 million and yet they have managed to make the game worse. They have failed to learn from other titles in the past and build on them. Now all this aside the game has its moments realistically the best thing they could do help mitigate the BS is just add a non competitive option to the game. Another option entirely is allow for server rentals if I could I would spend 50 dollars a month to have my own instance from a company whose servers I know aren't garbage. In short the game still needs work despite already being in release at this moment I would't recommend this to anybody. I don't like suggesting games that I myself regret buying and I hardly ever regret buying games. Despite spending 335 hours playing this game (at time of post) about 40 percent has been spent cleaning up or dealing with the mess left behind by the developers. The mixed reviews status on the store page speaks for itself this game is failing to meet the standards.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-01-31,0,0,440,False,Not Recommended,Out of the 350 hours ia have played on this game i'd say collectively about 24 hours of that time was enjoyable however the remaining portion of my time on this game has been spent running town to town finding nothing but shotguns and pistols for the first 5 minutes of the game. if i were ever lucky enough to get past this point and find an assault rifle finally 70% time i was greeted with being on the polar opposite side of the zone running down kilometres of roads and not being able to find a single vehicle. This isn't an issue with the game this is just how the game is for the most part. if you ever are lucky to gather up a vehicle and neccessary resources and find yourself in the last 25/10 situation you will get faced with your next major issue. that half of the playerbase is chinese. Yet they still go out of their way to play on OCE/NA/EU where it genuinely disrupts gameplay for that whole server. you will often find yourself laying a point blank shotgun round or 2 headshots into these players and because of the huuuuuge ping difference you'll find your self getting shot after they should be knocked down or straight up dying. because on the other end they saw you first and shot you first so the game compensates in their favour and grants them the kill. Now regardless of What Brendan Greene states Nobody who is asking China to be region locked is doing it purely for the fact that they utterly despise the Chinese themselves they are saying this because it is causing huge playabilty issues across all servers. (not to mention Brendan himself even admitted that 99% of current hacks were stemming from China) So if you really want to buy this game i say you wait until its rounded and The devs are prepared to do something serious about the connectivity issues and the rampant hacks that make themselves blatantly clear from game to game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

No one will pick you up when you're downed and they'll make it easy to spot you. That's if they don't kill you first for your loot. The M.O. with random squads is loot a whole town together and kill off your squad for the extra loot because they will kill you and do the same tthe game actually encourages team killing. And learn some kind of oriental language if you want to communicate there is no region blocking and asian countries get a lag advantage for playing in NA servers.Solo See people when you first land and take them out quick. Run around the map for thirty minutes not seeing anybody and get sniped from across the map by some guy laying in the final circle if you don't get sniped by somebody first. I have maybe spotted someone before they've spotted me twice because the hackers are not dealt with in this game.

I will also preface it by saying I have not written very many Steam reviews but here we go.I used to love PUBG absolutely adored the game when I first started playing it 6 months ago but since then it has turned into an absolute show of a game. The developers just seem to care about rushing cosmetics or ports for this game wondering about how much they can cash in before they are legitimately exposed as a fraud. There has been no serious actual content update and they have the audactiy to ignore the community for any feed back whatsoever. Here recently they have started so much work on this new tropical map that they refuse to make the other ones playable. There are very real audio glitches vehicles clipping issues and choppy frames when driving a vehicle. This was more forgivable 6 months ago but still nothing is being done about it.This is just my personal thoughts on the game currently when the company themselves are sueing other companies for no damn good reason.

2017-07-08,0,0,77,True,Not Recommended,The game is so overwhelmingly controlled by RNG and servers consistently have such poor performance that it is almost impossible to enjoy. There is nothing as exciting as spending 15 20 minutes playing a game getting into the top 5 and dying to someone who is lagging across your screen from 10M away but you somehow can't manage to hit them while they randomly dink you with an UMP. Even for a game in early access the basic mechanics are terribly coded and mindboggling. Play or watch any streamer and watch how bad the hit box and aiming is. Save yourself the money and go shove your dominant hand into a woodchipper for an equally enjoyable experience at a drastically reduced time investment.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-05-27,0,0,72,False,Recommended,"PLAYERUNKNOWN's BATTLEGROUNDS is the quintessential multiplayer experience. Though it may be a little rough around the edges the adrenaline rush of making the top 10 in solos is unlike anything I've experienced in gaming before. I first tried my hand in battle royale in Fortnite but it's flavor/building mechanics just weren't for me. PUBG blends just the right amounts of simulation and ludicrousness for an incredibly fun competitive game that's easy to jump in and out of. While the game itself is no means a 10/10 (mostly due to the aforementioned roughness even after coming out of early access) PUBG is definitely one of those games where you'll wonder where the last 100 hours went. ""I'll just play one more match"" can quickly turn into 5 10 more matches if you're not careful. If you were like me and watched streamers play for the last year give it a go!

(CONS) Because it's too slow Because the creators doesn't care about their game Because it claims itself elite and hardcore whereas it isn't due to the bugs and tickrate problems pubg Because as I've said before it conatins loads and loads of bugs Because of tickrate problems Because of bad optimalizationPROS Slow gameplay makes players able to play more tactically Good combination of gun pairing (combos) and balanced guns Once you have found a player on the map the gunfights can be really intense Bigger map base than all other quality BRI recommend pubg for a thin playerbase however I give this game a thumbs down because it's lack of improvement.If you want to play a game their creators are taking care about and fast enough to be entertaining then choose fortnite.It's just too late for this game to come back to the top.For those who are about to flame me let me say something I love pubg and it has so so much potential but to max it out we need ambitious developers,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-02-04,0,0,1214,False,Not Recommended,"When I first got PUBG (from a friend who insisted on buying it for me because he envisioned it would be fun to play together) I did not think much of it. I wasn't an FPS kinda gamer to begin with and the whole Battle Royale concept was also very foreign to me. Despite the many bugs lag and insanely awful vehicle mechanics the game turned out to be very addicting and super fun to play with friends. I loved the whole idea of a squad of players tactically assessing the terrain and situation to outsmart and outgun other squads. I started to rack up several hours and was really excited to see where the game was going to go.Fast forward past numerous patches several chicken dinners and high hopes for the official release the game had begun to really unravel. Constant game crashes insane FPS drop and infested with Chinese hackers the game was beginning to look like the horror stories I had heard from friends about other Battle Royale games that had tanked. This on top of the fact that Bluehole had implemented crates where you had to pay for keys really started to shake my faith in the devs.As official release came around it seemed like the devs were finally starting to tackle all of the issues we just wanted an optimized game with no cheaters! Seems simple maybe put off the whole esports adverts and pay for crates and actually dump some of that money into this game to improve the actual gameplay and experience.Unfortunately enough even though the ""official"" release has come and gone the hackers remain my $2k computer still can't run this game even a fraction as well as other optimized games and as a result the love has died out. I put in a ton of hours can still clear the school out and get the chicken dinner no problem but the game just has way too many issues still. I waited to post my review well after the smoke had cleared just in case the devs would be able to work it out but I can safely say to stay away from PUBG. The concept was great and the intended direction was perfect as well but the execution just flat out failed to meet any real expectations of the community.I'll probably still play a few games here and there just to kill some time but take it from someone who has played a thousand + hours it's not worth it if you're expecting a high quality game it's clear to me that the devs DO NOT care whether or not they have a loyal player base and would rather continue on with their pay for crates as well as failing to address the real issues at hand.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2018-01-23,0,0,1390,False,Not Recommended,This game has some really broken physics. You can't get out of water and onto land if the bank is over one foot high even though they added vaulting.

2018-02-04,0,0,326,False,Recommended,The game is great besides when you get players that instant quit or when you get enough in game points to buy a game which then keeps giving crates that require yourself to buy keys just to open them where there 2.50 a pop and you might get a item thats worth .5 thats the only thing you would have to worry about. the rest of the game is good just the the crate and people quiting right at the start or other things.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-09-20,0,0,935,False,Recommended,Such potential. Such staggering potential. But wasted by truly incompetent developers.What do you get when you strip away the fetid detritus from most every other FPS throw 100 people together in a sprawling wilderness with nothing but the clothes on their backs a dash of lady luck and the promise of a chicken dinner? You get potentially the best battle royale experience since well the PlayerUnknown's Battle Royale mod for Arma.But what happens when you put that potential in the hands of developers who don't appear to know their asterisk from their elbow where each progressive patch over rules any gains from the previous patch taking three steps backward for every one step forward? You get Bluehole's PlayerUnknown's Batttlegrounds. Not so much a missed opportunity but an opportunity that can't seem to be realised because of the regressive nature of each bandaid update.Yes bandaid. What they break in one update they fix in another update by enforcing or entirely removing complete features hobbling together something that sorta works if you approach it in just the right skewered and off hand way. And of course because it's Bluehole the bandaid is often filthy and hastily applied so it breaks something else.The reality is PUBG has potential. It's shown it has potential. But is also has bugs and flaws in equal number. And they never seem to get resolved in a complete capacity. Hell most of the issues that existed six months ago are still prevalent now. And each bug fix update seems to be a step backward that typically breaks something else along with it. A more cynical mind might believe that Bluehole are actively trying to sabotage their own product here but I believe it's just plain old fashioned incompetence.PS. Yes. I play it to death. I'm hooked. You'll probably be hooked too.The End.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-13,0,0,177,True,Recommended,This game at it's core is a very good game. I started out a bit skeptical about it and didn't really play a lot. Then I started getting into it and now that first person mode came out it's like a whole new game within the game itself. The devs are obviously listening to the community as a first person mode was extremely desired. People are saying how this game is all RNG and pure luck. I can't say this game isn't heavily based on luck but there is still a thought process involved. However this game isn't without flaws.CONS Like many others have mentioned the devs did break their promise of microtransactions before complete release. That simply is outrageous.I understand it's still an early access game but the optimization is almost non existent. I have a decent PC running a GTX 1050 and I am getting drastic frame drops on the lowest possible graphics.Although all of this is the case once you get to that top 5 there aren't many games that can really get your blood pumping like this game. Go solo or grab a friend or friends this is honestly still a very entertaining game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-04-18,0,0,268,False,Recommended,PUBG is a battle royale (pvp) style multiplayer FPS. Start off in a plane with 100 players up to 4 players per team &amp choose where you parachute down. Once you hit the ground quickly find a gun and take down everyone else trying to take your loot in the area. The loot consists of items to heal yourself armor guns &amp attachments for them. Each map has their own variation of vehicles &amp guns.Recent patches have made the game much more playable from a performance stance compared to how it was.Currently there are a couple of major things stopping this game from being flawless at any rate. First of all the huge amount of bugs from things stopping your characters shooting to vehicles instantly killing you from the slightest tap or from tripping up on thin air as well as things not loading in or bullets not registering etc. But the main thing is the huge amount of hackers at the moment people who are shooting through walls flying around aim botting no recoil scans for the map to get the best loot &amp anything else you can think of.I would say to keep an eye on the progress of the game as it has regular updates &amp wait for the vast hacker problem to be sorted.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-11-27,0,0,104,True,Recommended,"Ive only had this game for a few days. so this is sort of a FIRST IMPRESSIONPros The game is thrilling af i havent had my heart race like this in YEARS. knowing each second could be your last and overcoming that is extremely rewarding. Cool cosmetics though they are paid for either by grinding ingame currency or paying outright. Awesome fun when you re playing with friends i havent laughed this much when playing with friends in quite some time. Seeing your toughest friend screaming like a girl while running for cover with 1 hp is fkn hilarious. Learning the game (at least for me) is extremely rewarding going from ""oh wtf hes a billion miles away and headshots me???"" to ""did i just headshot that guy 300 m away??? im so fkn good"" is tons of fun and the map is sooo big it offers lots of different strategies from going all snipey snipes to ""in your face"" combat and that's lots of fun.Cons Right out of the bat i realized this game has HUGE issues with optimization i do admit that im on holiday and ive only tried it on my gaming laptop. but after seeing a few reviews ive realized im not alone when i say this game is melting my laptop down the buildings arent rendering not to mention you either get terrible quality or super hd no real in between. and that's bad unless you have a monster pc. HACKERS... funny when you see someone running at 1000 mp/h through the map. Not so much when ppl start dying on the plane becasue some hacker is killing us all without having a chance to fight back. Unrendered buildings. i know ive already mentioned the optimization issues but i think this deserves a mention of its own. There are times when you drop and the buildings havent rendered so u just stand there like an idiot hoping the house renders b4 someone kills you. The learning curve this is as much a pro as it is a con learning the game is exciting and rewarding HOWEVER the game doesnt have any sort of matchmaking YET so you're stuck with ppl who have waaaaay more playing experience than you and that can be frustrating for a new player.All in all if you have the cash to spare and youre looking for a game that will have you switching from ""I loooove this game"" to ""Fuuuuuuuck this shiieeeeeet"" back and forth then this game is definitely for you. i might update this review as i get more time with the game. but for my first veredict i definitely think this is a must buy.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

It's difficult to properly learn how the game works but after 50 hours I was able to get my first chicken dinner. The game is very addictive.BUT there are a few things you should consider bedore spending 30 euros in a game like this. Though the game is officially not in beta it feels so. The community is sometimes toxic (shouting in plane etc.) but after all not bad. The developers are fu**ing lazy. They sometimes listen to the community after months but with all the money they got from the game they could've made it so much better. VERY BADLY OPTIMIZED. If you have a weaker pc dont't expect this game to run like others. Again this is the developers fault. Constant perfromance problems with the servers. It all feels like a beta status game.Other than what is above this is a great game. I think the best battle royale game.

Instead it is yet another testament to making money on hype trains and terrible products defying darwinism.It's not EA bad but it still is horrible.If you got this far then the issues I'm talking about and have experienced firsthand include at least 1) teammates not seeing your nametag thus being prone to seeing you as a hostile which is crucial in this game2) character stopping every few seconds instead of running consistently throughout the while match3) sound not working throughout the whole match4) horrendous load times resulting in you staring at a black screen when you have already been dropped off and have already landed5) not being able to jump of the plane until the end of the route is reached6) app crashing as often as up to 3 TIMES within a 20 min session,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

From there it's a race to be the last one alive by finding guns ammo medical supplies and armor. The map continually shrinks until it's a VERY small area. I've finished top 10 once but every game has been a TON of fun and always felt different.The gunplay is great the map is huge and pretty deep mechanics that you have to learn the nuance of. All around fun time.My biggest gripes are the pre game lobby where it's just a bunch of people screaming n words and f***ots. Children probably optimization (but it's 2 months into early access i'm sure that will be brought up) rewards are slow and borderline not worth it.Pick it up spawn in die and keep on playing.Edit After getting 105 hours in which isn't much but has given me a much better understanding of the game I can safely say I still love this game.

2018-01-27,0,0,62,False,Recommended,ez 9/10 If you haven't tried pubg yet and you're not a complete mouth breather then you're missing out.I would've played it much sooner but the reviews made it sound terrible. Now I know why. In most matches I've played 80/100 players just walk around in the open firing their guns like some kind of mideast wedding and then cry HAX when they're shot. Of course they're going to leave a salty review. I'm having a blast. Just bring popcorn because the matches are typically 30+ minutes.(note I play solo and many of the recent neg reviews are about chinese ppl in the squad lobby so you might read some of those if you plan on playing with friends.

2018-01-08,0,0,180,False,Not Recommended,A shooter game from Asian developers what could go wrong??? Well apparently everything. Don't let the stupid overhyping from the so called gaming media outlets deceive you because if anyone is even more ignorant than the developers of this game it is those game journos. PUBG IS A BAD GAME. It is objectively bad. That's something every single person who played a real high quality shooter knows. Some cannot accept it tho but it's ok. And Asians are completely clueless about online shooters anyway so of course they think PUBG is a good game. They made this THE MOST POPULAR FPS IN THE WORLD (https //www.youtube.com/watch?v YeCO6AiY2y4) so let that sink in for a second.I bought the game because region price was good and also I admit it has it's moments where you enjoy it very much if you have friends to play with. Beyond that tho??? The game is utter trash it is Quality is so low you feel like you wouldn't play it even if it was free. Animations suck gunplay suck map design suck game design suck graphics suck UI suck performance suck progression suck. Cheaters are rampant crashes bugs glitches everywhere. And most importantly netcode is beyond horrible. Even when it is 2v2 tickrate can drop down to 2 Hz (yeah just two) and I csgo community have been complaining about 64 tick for quite a few years now. Movement is so stupid you feel like you are driving a car rather than controlling a character. Now some say it is intentional but then it is not just horrible it is also stupid. Overall almost everything about this game is bad and can be done way way way better. THat returns me to the first paragraph When will this game be fixed???NEVER PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds WILL NEVER EVER BECOME A GOOD GAME. Trust me I know the state Asian game industry is in. They have NO WAY OF FIXING THIS GAME. I am not saying they are lazy like Valve or greedy like EA. They are simply incompetent. Only way this game is being fixed is if Bluehole sells it to a proper Wstern dev or they come here. FPS is the most difficult genre to develop and even the biggest industry leading studios like Valve DICE has many troubles about getting it right I am simply shocked how can anyone with a functionaing brain can believe some random asian mmorpg dev can fix this game.Verdict Buy and play it with friends if you want because it is fun. Just don't become a blind fanboy and lie to yourself (or everyone else fanboys of PUBG is like a cult at this point). Also don't pay too much attention to the game it is a trash game and it will soon find it's rightful place. It is already losing players on EU and NA those numbers are simply Chinese players (bots and farmers mostly a lot of cheaters too),PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-05-19,0,0,109,False,Recommended,I belive that PLAYERUNKOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS is a well developed game that needs polishing the combat system is fair and the weapons are terribly well balanced the graphics are outstanding with realistic gun textures but the ground surface looks as though it has been painted on with little effort going towards that area and the grass should be '3D' becuase when a player is to look at the grass it has two faces but no third or fourth face to make it look realistic. The game has two large maps with a third one getting trialed and soon coming. I belive in several years 1 3 (depending on the difficulty of the tasks) this game will be almost perfect. To have the best experience using a gaming PC is recommended because of how 'large' of a game it is. Rating 7/10 would recommend this game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-05-06,0,0,246,True,Recommended,So far I have 44 hours in this great game. I have actually brought this game twice the first time I just didn't enjoy it and got a steam refund. I felt that it deserved a second chance and I haven't regretted it since.Playing in a duo or a squad is far more enjoyable than playing solo in my opinion. Solo is somewhat more difficult compared to duo or squad. The fact that you could be sniped by someone you never saw is frustrating however when you play as a duo or squad you can be brought back up to your feet on extremely low health is make the experience so much better as working as a team is rewarding. Of course if you like a more tense experience solo is very good for that it is tougher but getting a kill is so much more of an achievement.Playing as a duo has this tense experience as it is difficult to drop somewhere there isn't another team but not to the exent of solo and once your nearby oppenents have been dealt with the game plays more like a squad game than a solo. A squad game in my opinion is the most enjoyable game type in PUBG. Playing with others just makes this game great there will be moments you will remember either because your teammate mistakes you for an enemy and kills you (This actually happened to me and we laughed about it for about 5 minutes straight after it happened) or because you won a squad game without anyone in your squad dying.If you buy this game which I recommend you do having friends to play it with makes it 10 times better. Anyway most people do own this game so you shouldn't struggle to find a squad. The dev team is constantly working (so far) to make this game even better than it is. The game does need better optimization and until the dev team works on that you will need a good pc to play it but ignoring that this game is great and a definate purchase who enjoys these type of games.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The game still acts as if it were still in early access with crashes performance issues such as visual studder and just things that don't make sense. The looting and shooting can be a lot of fun but considering how unstable the game is I cannot recommend it. Here is a list of bugs that I have encounteredlast 6 months Died to a shelf. The shelf then killed a teammate who went to loot me. Both was from falling damage On landing with parachute I get launched in whatever direction the game feels like I should be (this one appears to be fixed) Hit a cardboard box with a undamaged vehicle causing it to explode and kill my entire team. Someone was able to glitch into a rock and then kill my teammates Friend getting out of moving boat and dying instantly last week until now Crashes and unable to load back into the game. Grenade launching me a great distance and outside the safe zone. Players vehicles and loot not loading in on screen right away. Blood splatter from shooting someone but them not actually getting hit.Spec wise I am well over the recomended and the game just doesn't run well.

On the way down you'll see wether or not anyone else is heading in the same direction as you. Depending on that you either need to just hurry up and find something useful to kill the others or you can spend a few minutes looting and getting everything you need. The game has great pacing when it comes to narrowing down the playzone and actually finish a match. You need to be clever and patient to actually make it to the end.Still needs a bit of work but is 100% playable in this Early Access state.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Also it is quite friendly to new players cause me and my friend come 3rd and 1st after 7 or 8 games and we didn't have any experience playing such survival games. Also due to the laggs if I drop too early from the plane I have decent chances to find buildings and cars not visualized properly so I can go through textures and even die from stucking in them (not funny at all).I hope that at the final version all these bugs will be reduced some more weapons and equipment will be added maybe the map will be expanded/or new maps will be added and give a wee bit more time for looting places and this damn blue area won't shrink that fast.All in all if the game will be optimised properly it's a must have item especially when you have a friend or two who is also willing to spend loads of time playing in it.UPD This game was released in early access 1 5 months ago but from that time the major errors were not fixed despite the enormous amount of money they received after releasing this game. However after 1 month of patches which did not fixed game's performance they decided to take a 10 day vacation and make a charity tournament (which just proved how many bugs they still got). I expected more work from their team. That is disgraceful 4/10,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I can't fathom why they would leave a map selection feature out of the full release... It's pretty arbitrary and dumb on the part of Bluehole.RIDDLED with hackers. No exaggeration every 1 2 matches at least one person in my squad is killed by a random obvious hacker. A studio with this many game sales should be investing heavily in a state of the art anti cheat system... I've personally spoken with people who proudly proclaim that their hacks will never be detectable and they'll never stop hacking PUBG.Bluehole is failing miserably on this front and they're running with our money instead of investing in proper systems to prevent hacking.Bugs dying behind walls textures failing to load in massive dsync issues etc. Honestly the list goes on and on.I'm changing my review from positive to negative because the game has left Early Access and is apparently what Bluehole considers to be ""full release"" material. To be completely fair I've had a lot of fun times with this game. Those fun times have recently been overshadowed by the realization that the problems the game has are not just ""quirks"" and small bugs. These are problems that come with the fully released game.If Bluehole ever gets around to addressing these problems I'll switch my review back to positive.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Yes there are those moments where you walk for long periods of time and not find anybody but towards the end it gets real intense. (IMO) So don't get this game if 1.

This game is fun to play fun to watch... no really go check it out on twitch.tv.100 players spawn in an aircraft you choose when to jump out. When you land all weapons and gear is procure on site. The player has to gain various upgrades (whether they are healing items weapons or other equipment) that are scattered throughout most of the map.For those that have somehow managed to stay ignorant to the battle royale concept you essentially are playing in a play area that shrinks over time pushing players together. If you are outside the play area you take damage. This zone will eventually shrink to non existance although typically the game ends before that with the last player (or team in team mode) standing. The game is playable in 100 players solo 50 teams of 2 or 25 teams of 4.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

This is because of a very poor netcode. This means that when you land it is very much impossible to do anything. In most cases this is life and deathin my opinion this game is fun but can get boring and vechicle physics dont make sense.

For example once dead you simply exit the match no spectating leaderboard or any way to see who wins the round. You often don't know where you were even shot from so it's a little anti climactic having just spent 20 minutes working your way down to the final 20 players.Graphics are similar to DayZ standalone.

It's fast and intence hard but not too hard. The more you play it the more you get used to how people will move around and you'll learn to counter it.I've had alot of fun with the game but i cannot recommend it to others because there's most likely better Battle Royal games coming out where you wont have to deal with really buggy gameplay and developers that doesn't fix their mistakes and are extremely slow. (would recommend battle field 5 or black op 4)In the hands of developers that actually care about their game it would really have the potential to one of the best games out there. I had my hopes up for the game when i first bought it back in March 2017 and oh boy has it grown since then but since they got competition on the same market they've begun to take the game to places it's not ready for at all and making lawsuits that doesn't make sense it's like watching an 8 year old kid being forced by his parents to be an adultThe developers barely care about the game anymore they just want your money and you have to pay for the game to see that.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-03-28,0,0,156,True,Recommended,Graphics 8/10The graphics on Ultra really blow H1Z1 and Arma out of the water. I'm only giving this an 8 because there are some obvious issues with colors when the graphics are cranked up. Example characters hair gives a skunk effect in certain lighting in game.Optimization 4/10Whether you have a GTX 660 or a GTX 1080 this game can still bog down into the 30 and below FPS Range. Professional streamers with $10k rigs have trouble getting proper Frame Rate from this game. This is an early access game so I expect this to only get better but as of now this is a big issue.Gameplay 9/10I really think the gameplay is much better than the competition. Hit registration feels the way it should attachments add some variety to the gameplay and it seems slightly more skill based instead of luck when firing long distances.Areas for improvement would be input lag when opening doors and better responsiveness when moving. I understand this game delays your full sprint speed by 1 2 seconds which is realistic but it feels sluggish in this regard. The ranking system also applies to solo/duo/squad gameplay so you can finally get credit for your games where you're not forced to play by yourself. Loot crates are easily obtainable as well so no more spending $20 for a single crate. Overall If you're playing H1Z1 and you're tired of the luck based firefights and stale gameplay play this game!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-07-10,0,0,233,False,Not Recommended,"No. Just no. When this game came out in early access it had a lot of potential. It was glitchy and broken af but we all gave it a pass on that because it was just so much fun anyway. When the game released it was still glitchy and broken af. This is when things started going down hill. Bluehole listened to absoloutely no community feedback cared very little about what anyone actually thought and the creator himself Brendan Greene started quite literally making fun of players on twitter for whining about this lack of communication and calling players ""bad"" for dying to literal RNG. (I seriously suggest you check out his twitter to see the utter disregaurd for the community he has) But even so with the recent release of Sanhok things were looking up. I enjoyed the game it felt clean the map was good the guns were good and yet even with all of their money and all the hype up Bluehole had created it fell apart after only a few days. The servers are worse than they've ever been the game's endless glitches are becoming more and more apparent leaving us with an unplayable mess. This game is not competetive in any way because the servers and the terrible bugs of the game leave every fight up to chance. Do not buy this game has never really been good and I think the only reason we all bought it was because we all had faith that someday it would be good. I see clearly now that this will NEVER be the case. This is a terrible game and it always will be.

2018-01-15,0,0,153,False,Recommended,I Think this game can be Good sometimes but most of the time its really annoying when you can't your group of friends and whenever you play online with Solo Q U just get qed with random chinese People. I dont want to be racist but its just really hard to have a good time when they are team killing not communicating etc everyone knows what im talking about. Though with friends it is the best time you could ever have. Though it is challenging to play this game and run it on your pc just saying. Though I do think it shouldn't have went off early access I mean Ark Survival Evolved was in Early Access for like 1 to 2 years and the company has been adding things every week and a lot of those patches were bug fixes. I think if Pubg did this it would best but I do not have any problem that it is fully released. The one thing that really made me convinced to buy this game is it's price. 37 CDN LIKE WTH. Star Wars Battlefront 2 80 bucks Battlefield 1 80 bucks Call of duty WW2 80 bucks but Pubg 37 dollars is paying under for what it is for I think. One thing to remember when you buy this game is find some friends to play with.

2017-05-30,0,0,209,False,Not Recommended,Product received for free. Great game with lots of potential and a so far stable player base. Run by a developer capable of prompltly fixing server related issues pouring patches on a rather regular basis. No pay to win system implemented yet with no trace of one being made so far. Open beta non the less. This should be put into consideration before purchase. The game has been out for a while now yet it is the worst optimised piece of software I ever played so far. Dark souls 1 without DSfix runs smooth compared to PU BattleGrounds. Waiting for performance fixes and patches is advised.The leap of faith that is purchasing a open beta is one thing. Running the game for the first time on whatever high or ultra settings the game recomended to you is another. In my case I had to wait through roughly six minutes of 1fps slideshows before alt+F4 did its magic. 30 for a unfinished product is a gamble. A guarantee of the game entering a closed beta state doesnt come with the purchase. Although with this title that may be the least worrying issue. This game seems to have a lush future ahead but with performance issues deep as these a price tag of 30 deserves consideration on the buyers end. (Unless runing a NASA equivalent PC)Just for reference Running a gtx 960 (2gb) with a mild overclock FX6300 3 5GHz (6 cores) 8GB Ram with 40 stable fps on such demanding titles like Wither 3 or GTA 5 on High settings (60fps with AA off). Yet this game is incapable of running stable 30fps on all graphicall setting turned all the way down and or off including .ini file tweaks for max performance. Take this terribel performance optimisation into account.PUBG 1.0+ UPDATE Game is no longer early access. Still runs like crap. 55 60fps on very low with the occasional drop to the one digit plane with semi frequent stutters and net code wich I believe uses RNG to determine hit box locations.Speaking of RNG shotguns are a blast in this game. To clarify if you ever find yourself at an Impasse in PUBG and feel the need to erase yourself from existence commiting suicide with a shotgun pressed against your skull does not guarantee a one shot kill or even a hit...Yet lots of fun to be had with this particular piece of software just make sure your PC is high on the high end spectrum. I recommend this game to anyone who has more money in their PC case than in their wallet.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-01-16,0,0,214,False,Not Recommended,"I've spent some time in this game and have come to the conclusion that there are some major fundemental problems with this game. But before I get to that here are the pros The game experience is intense and there is no other game that I can think of that makes my blood flowing as much. There can be geniune moments of fear panic heartbreak but there are other moments of sheer excitement shouting and cheering. The gameplay is unique and there are many different strategies one can emply whilst scavenging around the two massive maps. Team play offers more dynamic gameplay but Solo is just as fun.Now to the Cons Guns are sluggish and it feels like you have to wrestle them down just to control the recoil. You can spend an entire clip on someone at medium range without hitting them once. The game is about as buggy as can be. There isn't one aspect about this game that feels refined or polished. Hackers everywhere. Due to the randomness of the circles there are some instances where skill is taken out of the equation and you're forced to hope for good luck. Community is Toxic as hell. Often times death feels unfair or cheap. I'm not talking about being salty over being killed by a camper either. I'm talking about how close range firing seems to be a complete 50/50 since weapons lose all but some of their accuracy after the first shot. No region locking.I want to love this game. I've played so much of it hoping that at some point I'll see some sort of end to the equation and be able to work with the game and all its flaws. But it becomes difficult when it seems to actively work against you at every corner. I've stopped having fun with it now I've become more experienced in it. Now every time the match ends even if I win doesn't seem to be worth all the anger and frustration that you have to put up with in order to get there. All this added on to the fact that there is a hacker about every two games leaves a sour taste in my mouth.That and it's just insulting that they've added payed loot crates a system which is already seen as cancerous to a game that in its ""released"" state feels like a Beta.I would not reccomend this game to anyone but the most hardcore of players.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I understand that this game is in beta but it would be great that instead of updating the games weather effects and weapons if they could just make it playable first Everything from server lag memory leaks framerate drops and having to constantly tweak PC settings and it seems they couldn't address that in their first ""major"" update. This game is mildly fun for a round or two before I get so frustrated with the performance issues I decide to play something else. I have multiple PCs I play this game on from my $2000+ desktop to my $1300+ laptop this game runs like absolute garbage. It's an awesome idea just poor execution along the lines of making it work for everybody. If you want a game that functions properly and is user friendly this one is definitely not it. If the playability issues were ever addressed I would gladly come and change this review to a positive one.Update Frame rate issues have been fixed! Now if only in every clutch moment when I go to pull out my gun or pick one up in the beginning of the game I could actually pull it out pick out or just plain use it. You know to kill the opposition (the point of the game) that would be great. This is a recurring issue if there is a lot of activity in my area.Update THe game now runs as it's expected to.

In order to complete the game and win you have to sink at least an hour into the game with this dull gameplay on a huge empty map.

First seen first dead is the way it seems. There are some frame rate issues and some issues with the lag but this is early access so it is to be expected. Hopefully these issues will be addressed with future updates. The game is fun and the concept is really good.

2018-01-16,0,0,59,False,Recommended,I would reccomend this game This game is a lot of fun but the amount of bugs and issues make it not as fun at times. like i said I would reccomend this game but i have to give it a negative review for a few reasons. first my biggest problem the player in my game. i was playing a game and i was getting shot at. in the death cam the player was chinese and was not even aiming at me when he mag was empty i was still alive without him even reloading i was dead. the lack of reigon locking the players makes the game un injoyable at times. also whe i open the game the default server i was on was aisa(i swiched it to N.A.). i love this game but the number of players in a server with really high pings make the game no fun at times. the bugs don't bug me that much since i don't see them as much but the chinese players with their high ping is not the best i hope they reigon lock players or get more servers for certain areas. i would reccomend this game all the way. but not at the moment.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-01-30,0,0,2144,False,Not Recommended,"Let me start off by saying the game is awesome. It's an awesome concept and brings a fresh look at TPP and FPP games. With that said the problems with the game aren't really with the game at all. It's Brandon Green and Bluehole that are the problem. To be even more specific it's their liberal world view which is basically ruining the game. First the players from day 1 have been complaining about Chinese players. Not that we don't like the Chinese but their pings are absurd. The Dsync caused by this is SOOO bad that it makes the game unplayable. You can put a full shotgun blast point blank into sosmeone but because they have a 27438686432 ping it won't even register. Sounds like a legitimate complaint right? Something a normal dev would look at and be like ""Oh maybe they have a point"". Not Brandon Green. Nah he says we're all xenophobes. It's not that the game is broken it's basically because what he refers to as ""his community"" is just being racist. That's how the dev's feel about the people who buy their game. If you complain about flaws in their game it's not their fault it's yours for being a racist xenophobe. The other obvious issue with having large amount of chinese players playng on the North American server is the breakdown in communication. If they could speak English or I could speak chinese it wouldn't be a problem. Trying telling someone who doesn't speak your language that someone is entering the house they're in. Not so easy. But of course this again isn't a legitimate complaint i'm apparently just being racist. So thats really what you should be prepared for. A fun game thats broken because the people who should take care of simple issues would rather call the people who spend money on their products racists and xenophobes. Don't worry though our complaints have recently been heard. Instead of fixing the game they gave us micro transactions. Just what they claimed everyone wanted. Nobody wanted a functional game according to them we wanted to spend more money on a broken game.This is the typ of experience you can expect. It's like a super talented up and coming sports star who gets busted with 100 kilos of coke. A waste.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

How can you accurately respond to a guy that has 300+ ms ping and their character model is nowhere near where they actually are?Bluehole your North American playerbase is not being xenophobic. We just want to be able to effectively communicate with our teammates and not be at a blatant disadvantage because our opponents ping prevents us from discerning where they are.I cannot reccomend this game right now due to the extreme innundation of players who should not be able to play on servers across the globe.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-04-01,0,0,283,False,Recommended,I was extremely excited about this game when it came out. The intentions of the designers and developers are great and I have no doubt this game will be a dominating force in the Battle Royale genre (some would say it already is). But the fact is that this game is really not ready for even Early Release. Here is why 1) When it runs smooth it's an amazing game. IF it runs smooth. There has not been one day I have not experienced some major bug in the game. I don't mean hearing bullet shells from across the map (which is a thing) but falling through entire buildings because they failed to load before dropping onto the map.2) It's a RAM hog. I have a decent computer with 16gb of RAM with a GTX 760 and it just freezes up when running this game at times. When I exit out of the game the computer feels the shockwaves of playing the game for minutes afterward and takes some time to get back to normal.3) If you happen to have the game running smoothly that does not mean the others around you do as well. If you are prone to being triggered by teleporting enemies then it would be better to wait for this game. There have been multiple encounters in the game where you may shoot at someone and they will all of the sudden disappear and reappear right next to you over your now dead body. It can make for a frustrating time.4) It is impossible to tell where someone is shooting from. They have not worked out all of the sound issues though I know they are actively improving this aspect of the game. But for now good luck finding that guy lighting you up from who knows where.I cannot wait for this game to get optimized and some of the major kinks to get worked out. I know this is Early Release and that is the nature of the beast but when it starts to make a game unplayable then it becomes an issue no matter what stage of the game development you are at. In a couple of months watch out this game will be unstoppable.**UPDATE This game has come a long way since my initial review. From addressing hackers to optimization there have been enough improvements for me to easily recommend this game now. There are still plenty of areas for improvement but I think that with the rise of other games such as Fortnite the devs understand more than ever that to stay on top you have to always improve. The pressure is on for the title of the King of Battle Royales.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-10-10,0,0,419,False,Not Recommended,"Solid base for a good game. Needs lots of work though to be excellent game.Current Price is not justified as there is no diversity in maps and gameplay.Pros Giant Map but guaranteed enemy encounters as playing zone decreases over time you'll HAVE to get close to others Unreal Engine based so high quality textures models and shaders perform fine on medium power machines Playable as Solo 2 or 4 Player Squad gamemodes. A ton of fun with actual friends Gunplay is well crafted and player encounters mostly lag free Since the ending zone location is random each subsequent game is different Complete Gameplay is cloned from Arma but works properly as it is not made by Bohemia.Cons Is meant to be based on the Arma 2 Battle Royale Mod (who's creator is PUBG's creator).That is not any contra to most people but Arma games are not a good example for good multiplayer games ever.I personally am glad that PUBG has only copied the good Arma mechanics. At the moment EVERY time I start the game the first round I join has the Loading Screen ontop period and I only hear the gameplay. No menus are displayed. I have to alt f4 the game and start again. That's just an unnecessary bug. At the moment only one static map no random generated maps At the moment VERY sluggish player movement. Not animation based not simply transform based but seems to be inertia based.I still have trouble jumping over 30cm fences or a 20cm step into some toolsheds. From a standing pose it is impossible to jump forward. You only jump upwards. You have to walk 0.5 1m before you jump forwards correctly.I hope this get's adjusted sooner than later as it is a common gamebreaker to me especially during medium range gunfights where it is important to quickly navigate terrain to get a positional advantage. At the moment Audio engine is completely in need of redo. 80% of the time when I hear a friendly player run near me or shots are fired around me in medium distances the stereo channels seem to switch. Things that I know are to my right I hear on my left. It's really weird and COMPLETELY disorienting.It ONLY happens with medium range sounds though.When closer than 50m I hear correct stereo. When farther than 200m I hear correct stereo.When in between these distances the channels seem to be flipped. I don't think this is intended ) At the moment Interaction commands are delayed randomly not depending on ping. Sometimes doors when tried to ""open"" start to play the closing animation meaning they snap to being open then close. Wastes time.Getting into a car does not work properly sometimes I have to hit the command 2 3 times before it works. Annoying. The price of 30 bucks is not justified for a game still this early in development.Only one map which is always the same only loot locations are random.Gameplay is not diverse it's always last man standing. Combined with only one map it's quite boring after you know each part of the map. After that it's just Get in Get good gear avoid being killed kill others. Just like DayZ.I'm 10 hours into PUBG and have seen each part of the map already. That's not a bad thing it's just..for 30 bucks I expect many different locations and gamemodes already in the game.Overall I DO recommend the game if you have 1 3 good friends and you all find it thrilling to work together tactically against others.I am however not satisfied with the current features and lack of map availability. But other maps are planned in the future so all that's left is ironing out some poor mechanics adding more diversity and you have a decent battle royale game.I might have forgotten some minor pro's and con's but you should get the picture.Edit 2018 I have to revert my recommendation after the jump out of ""Early Access"" the game has indeed improved performance wise but bugs are still completely unadressed.Just now I had a ""network lag"" error which on MY machine means the game is irreversibly broken and there is now way to rejoin the match.On my friends machine it is possible to rejoin with the ""match still in progress"" window but on my machine it is NEVER possible. I just have to ask him to quit and start a new round.Also the more players are around us the more it lags stutters and glitches out.A bike suddenly flips while driving straight on a road even killing us on impact.This game is still as poorly made as it was before the ""final version"" the ""finished game"".Almost all of my previously stated bugs are still impairing gameplay even more have appeared regarding gunfights. Hitting the window frame when clearly aiming above it Killcams and replays are NOT any indication on what the person watched was doing whatsoever they instead infuriate me because it is just some random aiming and snapping on my player then 3 shots and dead.I am not satisfied at all with the final product and do not recommend it.As much as it is fun to play with friends and joke around (which PUBG is A LOT) too many glitches and game design flaws result in unfair deaths.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-05-08,0,0,273,False,Recommended,"Tha game is fun for casual play with friends that said it's horrible to be taken seriously as a competitive game the tick rate input delay and server lag are a joke. Shots frequently go unregistered and its common to die half a second after you hid behind a wall lagged players jumping into you will see and shoot you half a second before they appear on your screen. I play on optical fiber always above 100fps on a 144hz monitor my ping on local servers are all 5 10ms. The game needs to match players with the same average ping times needs better ""netcode"" and better server hardware. Also need to make weapons less arcady and bring some realism to it like ArmA level of ballistics which can be easily introduced in UE4 (ffs theres a tutorial for it on youtube) along with damage models that make sense. The reason being you can apply common sense when handling them instead of having to memorize whatever nonsensical stats the developers decided. Supressor for a 762 revolver rofl. If those things get improved the game will still be a bit based on luck (what you find where the final circle is related to you) but at least everyone will be able to compensate a lot of it with sill instead of complete luck based on ""netcode"". I guess the good thing for developers is that based on how the netcode of this game is it leaves the spot open for a proper competitive game to be developed still. Maybe ArmA 4 will get their together? I doubt it Bohemia Interactive is also a mess.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-04-24,0,0,331,False,Recommended,Current Review 12/22/17 So the game is out and it's better than ever. The 1.0 launch has almost doubled my FPS averaging about 120 fps and never dipping below 100 with the specs listed on my profile (1440p). Not to mention the new map has been worth the wait and then some along with a handful of new weapons vehicles and vaulting which completely changes the flow of the game. The map is super optimized and the experience is much different from the base map that shipped with the game in early access. If you were waiting to try the game out after it came out of early access now is the time. The game is flurishing and for good reason. I have high hopes for the future of the game along with new content for it as well.Previous Review EDIT 5/29/17 As of right now the game is running incredibly well on my hardware and many different computers granting my recommendation boasting high framerates with minimal frame drops. The last thing needed to make the game almost 100% stable is to better the servers. That's really it. The game is suberb.PUBG is pretty much all you could want from a battle royale game. Tons of weapon customization frequent encounters a well fournished map satisfying sound and gunplay and most of all tense moments of action. This game delivers a sense of tension that a lot of others fail to create. To adress the elephant in the room objectively speaking this game is better than H1Z1. But it's not to say the game is without fault. Even after the recent set of updates the game is still incredibly demanding on most systems with only the highest end computers being able to run the game consitently abover 60 fps on the optimized settings listed in one of the games most popular guides (in my experience with a high end rig and watching several streamers withhigh end computers play the game). Several of my friends (with Pc's ranging from the low to mid/high end range) have trouble running the game without massive frame drops. Even after the recent updates my PC still seems to choke every now and then too dropping from low 100 fps to low 40's for seemingly little to no reason. I understand it is still a developing project and the world is big and it is a pretty graphically impressive game but frame rate consistency is VITAL in games of this nature where at any time you can have an encounter that requires precison and lighting quick reaction.Overall I think with a little more work and the continuation of vigourous updates to the game (which are coming basically weekly now) will be the definite choice for people looking for a battle royale experience. However the game as of now is very inconsistent performance wise and has a very different style from that of H1Z1. It is most comparable (in my opinion) to Arma with it's weapon upgrades the large amount of weapons and very meaty gun mechanics. Which is neither here nor there and just as Dota and League of Legends are compared forming militant groups of fans respectively I see that becoming the case for these two games. Just consider before buying either that they are both early access and they both have promising futures.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Well much like a abusive relationship pubg can give incredible amounts of fun and excitement but it does beat me down from time to time. They released an incomplete game to say the least the amount of rubberbanding at launch is beyond laughable. We still have critical glitches bugs exe that ruin the experience. On top of that there are a few game elements that I can t for the love of god figure out why they have kept Red zone much unlike the blue zone which servers a very important purpose om forcing players to fight each other the red zone just feels like a big random middle finger that exsists just to randomly upp someones plans. The looting mechanics have always been unfair in pubg and I can t help but think there must be some way to make it better Of course the rng is what makes the game replayable but there definetly needs to be an improvment. In summary sure the game is good but I can t stand behind it even if I wish i could.Edit OHH LOOK AT THIS NOW YOU DON T EVEN GET A FEW FREE LOOT BOXES TIME TO CASH UP GUYS. YOU ALREADY PAYED TO BAD!Edit ps Look I gotta be honest and say they fixed most issues nowdays the main issue is chinese hackers. But still from a gameplay perspective I gotta recommend it again however since they did try and make this a cash grab and broke some of their promises out of principle I sugest you don t buy it.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

This company just shows more and more how greed is more important than its dedicated fans. They could have really made something great with continuous income flowing in... but they would rather hurry and sell out and make money fast and let the game crash and crumble...

2017-04-02,0,0,464,True,Recommended,"Battlegrounds is a battle royale game wherein 100 people drop into an 18 by 18 square kilometer island in order to battle to the death. A short time after the game commences a gas field begins to close in on the island killing anyone foolish enough to remain within it for too long. The gas gets more and more powerful and moves more and more quickly as the game continues. Eventually players are forced into deadly confrontations as they must stay ahead of ""the circle"" as it is commonly called. Upon dropping into the arena players must search for loot with a mad rush to acquire a weapon as soon as possible. With some luck a helmet as well since headshots are lethal. This is where the game will start to lose people. The initial surge to find the loot you need is exciting. But after you either evade or kill everyone near you you now begin to search for better loot level three armor level three helmet your preferred weapons first aid and so on. You develop tunnel vision for items and it feels cheap when you're shot down by some punk hiding in the upper story of a house somewhere.The gunplay has weight to it and is satisfying. The guns themselves look good and are detailed. The characters move pretty realistically aside from the jumping which not only looks stupid is clunky as hell. You have the ability to play in either first or third person at the press of a button which is handy for close quarters. You also have an inventory of course where you can view and use your items. First aid and boost items take real time to use and must be used wisely as moving will cancel the action forcing you to redo it.I am currently playing in 1080p with everything on Ultra except for shadows which are on High which takes a 15 frame hit on my rig Gtx 1060 6GB i5 4690k 4.2Ghz 16 Gb RAM 1600 Mhz. With these settings I average 60 FPS although certain areas of the game cause that number to drop by half.

2017-05-25,0,0,0,True,Not Recommended,"This game has a somewhat interesting concept that would normally align well with what I consider my favorite games in terms of genre style and so on. I really want to love this game but sadly I just can't bring myself to it. I get that this is early access and have fully considered that fact before leaving this review. That being said I also am not up to speed on the history and development of the game so some of my complaints about the game may be known and there for some compelling reason. The Good The world is pretty massive and has a fun layout with all the buildings and geography. The ARMA/DayZ mashup feel/concept is appealing to my gaming interests (in theory). It should be a good combo. There's gotta be something else??? The Bad Gameplay is fun for a bit. You get dropped onto an island and wander around killing other people as you run into them. It plays very much like DayZ (or similar) but what I actually think of more is the ""Gun Game"" mode from the later Call of Duty Black Ops game series. While you get to choose your weapons in PUBG it is still very much a game where you run around as fast as you can dodging bullets and eliminating other players like you would in Gun Game. All players in PUBG start on equal footing at the start of the match that is without any items or special perks. You must perform well (or get lucky) to get good weapons and increase your odds of survival. The concept is fun for a bit but gets repetitive very quickly. It felt like I was playing the same thing over and over again without any real variety. There was no development and nothing to keep me intrigued after a few rounds. I know that a lot of people like this repetitious style of gameplay but I don't love it and was bored to death before I knew it. I thought that maybe given how much world there was and all of the possible options for weapons and upgrades that it'd get old less quickly than other similar games. I wasted a lot of energy and gained a lot of frustration by getting disconnect in the matchmaking screen and occasionally in the middle of actual game play. I had so much trouble getting a good stable server connection that about half of my ""gameplay"" time recorded was actually me in the lobby trying to connect. I should mention that I have fiber optic internet and connections have never been an issue for me on any other game. I have not experiences framerate issues like others have had. I am running GTX 970's in SLI and was able to run the game in the ""Ultra"" graphics mode without issue. However the quality of the graphics still seemed pretty poor to me especially for Unreal Engine. I don't think it is just my incorrect perception the more I played the game the more I became sure that the graphics quality was more on par with UE 3 or something similar and outdated. My final complaint is with the match time and is potentially just my personal preference more than a hard fault of the game. At the beginning of the match you have several minutes to find weapons. At that point the region of gameplay starts shrinking and forces players to the center of the map. I get why this is necessary and I wouldn't want a 5 mile x 5 mile map with two players trying to find each other over the course of many hours. My complaint is that I feel like the amount of time between gameplay regions shrinking is too short. Gameplay and a singular match goes by too quickly. It'd be nice if they would double or triple the amount of time to slow down the game just a tad and allow players to focus more on scavenging and exploring. I really feel like this would increase the survival feel of the game which I thought was part of the point. Is exploration and scavenging generally part of the point of an MMO world too? It just felt as if there was too much focus on the fast paced shooter portion and not enough on the exploring and upgrading portion.In summary for the $30+ I paid I felt like I didn't get a very good value. There is nothing really unique about this game to make it worth that sort of money. It's a $15 game for sure. The MMO thing has been done many times before. The weapons are all very cookie cutter and there was nothing to really get excited about there. The graphics are lackluster. It gets boring really quickly and there are not really any qualities that I can think of that set this game apart.I rate the game 5/10 overall. It's fun for a playthrough once or twice but isn't a game I'll keep coming back to and I doubt it will be recognized as a classic in the years to come.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-03-16,0,0,428,False,Recommended,For quite a long time now I have been looking for games to give me that nostaglic feeling back. The feeling of spending hours and hours at once on a game with friends having a ridiculous amount of fun and 'accidentaly' staying up way too late. Safe to say this game has done that. Sure it's far from perfect but I truly believe that the developer WILL get to the point where everything people are complaining about in the reviews will be in the past.Here's my personal pros and cons list PROS Can be incredibly fun Getting a kill is very satisfying Brought back that nostalgic feeling Fairly frequent updates Getting that chicken dinner makes you feel like a ing god With the right friends this game is an absolute blast.CONS Can get repetitive sometimes Playing alone is not fun Only two maps (they're working on new ones though) Some guns have an insanely high and random spray pattern. These two DON'T mix together well so you sometimes just have to get lucky with your shots. If you don't prepare for rage Dying early and your having your teammates still playing is downright annoying and kind of rage inducing The parachute sometimes does a thing where you are just stuck and have to watch everyone find guns and contemplate your death ING SHOTGUNS OH MY GODThe only reason I didn't include hackers in this list is because I barely encounter any.

2017-12-26,0,0,19,False,Not Recommended,On release this game was a buggy piece of garbage. While I don't have a problem with the traditional battle royale 'running to circle simulator' formula and I understand why people find it enjoyable it does not excuse PUBG from the rest of it's faults. The game was and still is incredibly poorly optimized and it doesn't look particularly nice even when maxed out on a high end PC. Not that it matters anyway because playing at the lowest settings gives players a distinct advantage in that they have less grass and bush visibility. I would expect this lack of polish in a small neglected indie game not in the most popular game on Steam. The loot is also completely randomly generated so you could drop in a small town with nobody else around you and still fail to get any good loot and be doomed from the start. You could say that despite its faults the game is still fun to play and I would have to agree with that but I would have the same amount of fun playing just about any other game like mount your friends for a much cheaper price. Overall PUBG can be fun but I would strongly recommend just playing another game since Battlegrounds costs a ridiculous $29.99 and it isn't even included in the winter sale I feel betrayed.EDIT After the new 1.0 release update the game has a new map (which is infinitely more boring than the first one) new weapons and new vehicles. I think that the new weapons are good additions to the game especially the sawed off. But most of the flaws from the original game are still there connection issues are awful performance is slightly improved but nowhere near good enough and the community is as toxic as ever. This 'full 1.0 release' still seems like a game that should be in pre alpha to me and I will happily change my mind about the game if they decide to finally release an actually polished finished product in the near future.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-26,0,0,88,False,Recommended,"Note This review is written from an eyes of a New Player as you will be when buying the game.Even though I do recommend this game there are some things that are a pain. a big one. Here's a list of the Pros and Cons.Pro A) The game is over all fun and challenging. B) The game is unique the scopes the modification it lets you choose how to play.C) You can choose between First Person and Third Person which is a huge plus for people who get annoyed by TPP where you can see people through walls and for people who want it to be as realistic as possibleD) It's built on Unreal Engine 4 which in my opinon is the best engine out there (apart from custom made engines but that's a whole new story... Or maybe Disrupt but that's Ubisoft)Cons A) Rubber banding and the servers are crap. two out of five times whenever I land I can't move for 10 seconds and i get rubberbanded back. And It's not only me...B) There is literally NO way of getting familliar with the weapons no gun range no DM nothing... so when it comes that you find a sniper in game and you shoot a stay still from 200 meters you will have no idea how high enough the gun would need to be for it to actually hit which is highly frustrating. The argument could be made that you could jump into high populated areas and hot fight but that's just pain. Nevertheless there have been promised an aim map by the devs but they are running into trouble getting an offline mode for this game. The promise has been there for a couple of months now.C) The mini bugs. Getting hit by a car through a CarePackage losing health when parachuting etc.*Side note The game is not really 1.0 it's only like that to help the sales.Neutrals The game phase is slow. may bore some people... Overall I do recommend buying this game I hope that when time advances they will fix the bugs and they have the money and fundings too do so. an argument could be made that they could just ""throw money on the problem"" but as they said ""It's hard to find good devs"".",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-07-15,0,0,200,False,Not Recommended,"Loved this game when I first bought it in May 2017. Battle Royale was new to me so being a part of PUBG at that time felt very ""exclusive"". Around the time when they added the new desert map was when it was clear that this game was starting to decline. It has always been riddled with bugs and glitches and even after its official 1.0 release it still feels and acts like it is a broken game. The desert map was too big and not as fun to play on as the original map.There is a lot of luck involved with winning in this game. If you don't find a gun within the first few seconds you're pretty ed. If you don't find a good vest and helmet and find a lot of meds to keep your health up in combat you're pretty much ed. There is really no point in shooting at someone who is far away and near decent cover because as long as they have more meds than you they can keep ducking to safety heal and return fire. If they have more meds than you that in a way forces you to have to push on their location which could give them an easy kill.This game has 0 progression and there is nothing to unlock and try to earn. No ranking system. It has recently added an Event Pass similar to the Battle Pass in Fortnite. The Event Pass should not have been behind a paywall. This game was $30 and you have to pay real money to open loot boxes (buying keys) and access and a real progression system (Event Pass). Fortnite's Battle Pass is a much greater value because it costs only $10 and the game itself is FREE. All the money you'd have to spend to enjoy PUBG at its fullest and it's still very buggy and very unbalanced.If you want to get aggravated over playing Battle Royale (because lets be honest dying in BR is frustrating) just play Fortnite.

2017-05-05,0,0,364,True,Recommended,No review can truly give this game the credit it deserves as someone who has played Dayz mod since April 2012. This is the game I wanted to be made. All of the fun combat of survival games awesome weapons sweet vehicles and just enough loot gathering to scratch that itch.I love this game if you are on the fence pull the trigger.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-05-05,0,0,74,True,Not Recommended,very early access jankfest. i'm happy to update this review when the game is fixed but right now it's too broken to recommend buying.performancethis game runs like absolute butts. the best gaming pcs barely get 80fps. medium settings run better than low in some cases because the game is not thread aware any more than 4 threads on your cpu is wasted. $10 000 PCs still suffer from random stuttering on very low settings. the settings are so basic that you can't even toggle vsync or disable mouse smoothing without an ini fix.crashingright now the game crashes about every 3 matches. it wouldn't even be a big problem if you could reconnect but once the game crashes you have to find a new match. settings don't seem to matter. i tried using the crash report tool but their crash report server is down.glitchesthe game has so many glitches. every time you quit out of a game the whole game has to restart taking like 10 15 seconds. clientside damage and smokes flipping vehicles desyncs parts of the map disappearing spectator cam doesn't work at all just to name a few. otherwise it's a standard exciting survival shooter where all the people are really hard to see but if you kill someone you feel like you've got a big old pɛcker.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-05-05,0,0,151,True,Recommended,This really is a first impressions review I feel compelled to write.One word Wow!Had this game on my radar for a while and purchased today. I've played 6 rounds over about 4 hours whilst learning the ropes and now I'm completely hooked. This game is dead easy to pick up the idea is very simple but OMG well implemented. I guess the big comparison to this will be DAYZ and yes it's very DAYZ but seems already so much more than DAYZ in every way. No stupid zombies not even any chat. You can turn off the voice comm and you are literally alone. No stupid GTA stle blips telling you where everyone is you can play exactly as you want to. Jsut watch out for the blue death ray every now and then which draws the surviving players ever closer. A game lasts around 15 20 minutes then it's back to the lobby and into another. The object to acheive a higher placing than you did last time. ALso steam store tradable items which are gained from in game crates bought with RP which is nice (a nod to TF2 for sure). Graphically I think for an early dev game is really good sure theres some ragged bits but on the whole I love this game day one and I shall recommend whole heartedly.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I get that it's an early access game but the bugs can drive a man to put his head through his wall since the game is meant to be purely based upon competetive play.

2017-04-22,0,0,98,True,Recommended,After playing this game for about ten hours I have been very happy with the care and attention to detail the creators put into the game and I would whole heartedly recommend this game to anyone who is thinking of getting it however I feel that a lot of the time when you die you have no idea where from and so you can't learn from that death if the developers were to add a feature where the game were to pause and show you (relative to you when you died) where the person that killed you was it would give less angry fists on desks and more understanding aahs. I feel this system would also help weed out the sneakiest of hackers as it would show if the person was inside or out in a car or not even whether they were actually looking at the person or not or shooting whilst driving.Just to sum up that big paragraph above I would recommend the game however I feel that some added features such as the pan blocking bullets that we just saw implemented wouldn't go amiss.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-04-18,0,0,124,True,Recommended,This game is pretty impressive and has some serious potential. The two things I think would fit the game would be 1. A DayZ type game mode where you have unlimited time and it is like one big free for all and you can earn a ton of loot and guns but progress is reset on death. 2. Slowing the pace down a bit what is the point in a pretty massive map to then be locked out of the majority of it in the first six minutes? Maybe extend times to get ready and maybe a place to hunker down. But all in all this game is pretty awesome and could get even better.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

PROS + Game has a lot of potential Great shooting mechanics and 3rd person view Great visuals and effectsCONS Game is little bit pricey Game has much lags and with older PC's game has much FPS dropsin conclusion i suggest this game for anyone who is interrested in Battle Royale games or any FPS genre game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

They told us it was 50/50 to get both maps but it is blatantly a lie where it is more like a 10% to get erangel (the good map).

2017-04-20,0,0,180,True,Recommended,I have played the game on and off since day one and it is undeniably a blast to play. From early game all the way to late game the combat has its own unique aspects. The shooting is fluent and feels very natural. For an indie/early access game it is a f*cking blast solo duos and squad are all equally enjoyable and I would highly recommend this game. However it does come with flaws and many of them. With laggy servers slow actions and textures that take a couple minutes to load it is clear that the game is incomplete but it seems that the current dev's of PUBG are determined to bring regular updates. My only wish is that it doesn't turn into another DayZ,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-04-20,0,0,135,True,Recommended,The game is fun to play solo. However it is VERY VERY almost ludicrously fun to play with friends.100 people parachute onto an island and fight to the death Hunger Games style. You are unarmed when you arrive and must find weapons and gear scattered across the island. There are three game modes 100 player free for all 50 2 man duos or 25 4 man squads. Statistically speaking there's a 99% chance you will die in any given match so the enjoyment in the game for most people is seeing how long you last and how much you tear up before dying. I've played the game for only a few days but already I've had a lot of memorable moments. It's just that kind of game. The game has no official phases but in my mind I like to personally divvy up every round into three phases 1) Initial scavenger hunt. Maybe 20 40 people die immediately here each round. Towns and military bases typically have the best initial gear so LOTS of people will parachute into them. This leads to a mad scramble to be the first person to find a gun and a massive occasionally absurd bloodbath. If you parachute into the wilderness you probably won't fight anyone right off the beat but gear is slightly less common. There are even more nuanced advantages and disadvantages for different starting areas so you'll have to play around and figure out what's right for your play style.2) First couple circles. The game forces players into smaller and smaller areas by having a circular magnetic field constrict the play area at random. The first circles are very big and roomy and aren't hard to manage. If you are outside the circle you will need to move into territory other players are likely dug into. If you are inside the area you can fortify a house and hunker down. If you're playing squad or duo fortifying a house or hill with friends can be quite fun. 3) Final circles By the start of this phase typically around 15 25 people will be left alive. By now the play area has gone from being a massive island to a TINY area filled with only the best players. Tactics and strategy is key here. Eventually a winner/sole survivor will emerge.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-09-13,0,0,379,False,Not Recommended,13th September 2017 ReviewThis game needs more optimisation than ever. I recommend you not to buy this game YET as it is still in its early stages hence it won't run smoothly on a decent system. FPS ranges from 25 40FPS on my system commonly ending up in the lower end of this spectrum. (I don't have a spectacular $10k gaming rig with liquid nitrogen cooling or some other sort of alien tech attached so I lay down my reason for my crappy FPS in an FPS having a decent system.) Uses up probably 70%+ of your RAM while in game 60% is already used when queueing up for a game and crashes every few games because of low memory. (I had 10GB) In this case I only had the game on with only Discord on. The moment I turn on any additional browser/software game crashes. Random audio and FPS stutters so I usually get killed typically in all 1v1 CQCs. Vehicles are still bugged sometimes gets stuck inside a tree or house.* will only give a good rating after OPTIMISATION is done right. *18th October 2017 ReviewI wonder if Bluehole is going to listen to 99% of players who are currently being taken a on by the game due to lag netcode server performance etc etc...or the 1% elite tryhard cashers with $99k gaming rigs who says this game is already the best in performance because they don't have trash computers like us?I swear there's always those 3 man china dog squad trying to teamkill you every single solo squad game.28th October 2017 Review me this game still has connection issues. (I'm on wired and optical fibre internet) Oh right Bluehole is already doing so. Since they already have a separate team for PUBG's dev only why not use those brains to fix exisiting problems instead of creating new ones?4th December 2017 Review* FINALLY AFTER 10 MILLION CENTURIES *PUBG finally used their brains and decided to fix optimisation. And finally I can give this game a good rating. Receiving 30 60fps on a non SSD laptop with decent specs on lowest resolution.

2017-05-06,0,0,109,True,Recommended,Dayz minus the hours of travel in a good way.100 Players go in 1 goes out. Players are all air dropped with the same equipment their fists in a desperate attempt to hit the land and find anything to defend themself with. I compare it to Dayz because essentially it is but better. The game runs smoother animations feel more natural and overall the gun play is much more refined that its competetiors such as ARMA and Dayz.While a lot of the negative reviews of this game are rittled with angry remarks about hackers and aimbotters I have suprisingly not yet had an occasion where I was thinking to myself that they were cheating. Maybe its because there are less cheaters here (or maybe im just not a poor sport).The games map resembles many traits of ARMA 3 maps (hopefully more variety coming soon).They feel large enough that the game is immersive and just small enough that you're always at risk. On landing a designated play area is assigned which gets smaller as the game progresses forcing players into smaller areas so they will fight one another. Winning is the ultimate goal and provides you with nearly a 1000 tokens (which are only used to open cosmetic item crates).,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-04-24,0,0,1,False,Not Recommended,This game is really boring. I never felt this way before as a gamer till THIS. i have to agree with the people who bash gaming on this one because of the following reasons... You only wander around a big laggy map for 30 over minutes finding depending on your luck either good or bad weapons until you shoot to kill someone or someone kills you. Goodluck making it to the top because that is a very hard to achieve and even if you do there is nothing worthwhile to GRIND the HOURS you will waste if you dedicate your life to this its just cosmetic stuff THAT I KNOW the devs will defend by saying they should keep the playing field FAIR...It is really simple and i guess that is why people like it although i'd like to see some VARIETY in the possible CHARACTER BUILDS that give the illusion of ADVANTAGE or atleast some PROGRESSION or some keep worthy unlocks you have to earn....i think the only reason why it is popular is just because a bunch of youtubers or streamers play this game and their followers just hop on as well hoping to get sexy time from their fav streamers .... Anyway i heard a PLANET WORTH of China people are in it and no offense as i am part chinese i know they bombard a fad (like this game) in masses and make it cheap....and by cheap i mean the loads of hackers in the game that make the whole experience even more of a waste of time. Let's be honest guys it is not fun Save yourself 35 bucks and dont buy this game im glad i got a refund. Thanks STEAM.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I'm running into hackers every game now because the crappy anti cheat isn't do it's job properly. 3 games in a row and I died to some to guy with a full number name spamming a sks or mini 14 from 300+m away and kill me with headshots. I try and try to play this game but it's ALWAYS a disappointment. The core game mode is great but the fact that the developers can't seem to fix their problems is whats pushing me and many others away. I don't mind hackers in other games it's PC there's always gonna be hackers. In pubg it feels so infuriating. Spend all this time to loot make sure you have the best gear to take with you to the end game only to die to someone who didn't out preform out luck out skill but just to straight up incompetent devs? Yeah esports ready! Yeah 1.0 ready! I can't bring myself back I'd rather go to fortnite where they can PROPERLY handle the hackers PROPERLY develop servers PROPERLY update the game. You don't see fortnite or any other game keeping their updates in a test server for 6 months because it breaks the entire game. You don't see any other game pushing back EVERY SINGLE UPDATE because they're incompetent and can't update their game.

Admittedly I'm not very good at the game and have less than 30 hours of play but I learned a few things worth sharing This game is difficult many shots from the weapons will take you out instantly. The inventory management is pretty simple/straightforward but takes time to become familiar with and you will be at a disadvange until you get it down for quick looting/management The playable area of the game shrinks quickly as time progresses and you must always be mindful of time and lastly there are way too many cheaters in the game. Players hack so many different aspects I see autoaim cheaters infinite ammo vehicle speedhacks and the list goes on. It really does suck to spend 20 minutes working toward a win and having a stinking cheater take you out.

I have barley come across any bugs so it is in a very stable state. The only issues is the server. The servers (for now) are good enough they work but the do have thier hicupps and you will sometimes die to some lag. The developers have alot more planned for this game (or so they say) so it shoud end up even better in the future.

2017-05-07,0,0,7,True,Recommended,"Early access.. The new gaming standard so just a heads up.When Battlegrounds works it works well. The overall experience is enjoyable and despite negative reviews complaining about aimbots etc I can honestly say that when I've died I've not felt cheated. I accept I'm not the best player so I don't feel the need to call ""shenanigans"" every time I die. (Some people are just whiney pups.)When Battlegrounds fails it does so bigtime. Now considering it is early access you do have to make allowances I still recommend this game but in its current state you should be prepared for frequent crashes. My own experiences *2 in 5 games results in the game closing unexpectedly to desktop.*1 in 6 games locks my PC resulting in a power off restart.*1 in 6 games fails to load UI lobby correctly. (Theres a refresh button but this reloads the whole thing and takes 10 15 seconds but at least the Dev team have in a small way dealt with this issue.Otherwise the game is worth the money but Fingers crossed they take it all the way out of early access and crack on with the reliability issues. 10/10 would not check map while out in the open.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-05-02,0,0,21,True,Not Recommended,The concept of the game is great how ever the mechanics in regards to hit netwokring and shooting are just atrocious. Getting one shotted after un loading 4 8 shots is just the start of it. The 5.56 should be a 3 shot if no body armour yet i shot a guy 3 times (One hit his leg) he should have been on &lt 10% health and yet he still one shots me and kills me in a gun fight when i have full health with a smg..... I expected atleast decent shooting mechanics &amp hit mechanics. Hopefully the devs are listing and can make the necessary improvments that will make this a fantastic game.If they leave the game as is with its B.S. Hit mechanics i will have to give it a 1/5 stars. At this stage it is better than H1Z1 Battle Royale so i will recommend it asumming the devs will make the necessary impovments.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-05-06,0,0,15,True,Recommended,I can say that this game is fun to play and it has potencial and needs to be much much more optimazed to play smoothly. My concern is only one thing so far is that im pretty shure cheaters are much in the game /...killing me in spots behind walls when theres no way a player can know im there without seeing me first its very fishy. And on top of that one shot head kills. Its not posible...i am not a top player but i can see when something is not posible without a cheat.That needs to be fixed. Other then that devs just work on the game and keep adding stuff and smooting the gameplay and it will be very good game.Also what i would like to see in this game as a fun factore of more 1 More maps at least 5 with diferent scenary (forest zone snow zones desert place...ets)2 Loads of variety of weapons all tipes and maybe rocket launchers?3 Traps...that u as a player if u can find a trap put it...like a landmine tripwire mine like beartraps and so on.4 As u deploy in the field via a airplane at least give all people a ordinary knife thats mine opinion.5 Day and night ciclus or in this game case day and night maps...i think that would be cool )6 Maybe some kind of chara progress? Like u get some skill points where u can putt them in arm combat or mele combat or guns damage or something like that? Just little something so u know u are progresing in a game but not that much that u drop in the field OP against new players that have none skill points atributed.7 Maybe have some kind of diferent game modes aswell capture a base (point) or zombie survival mode P?Well some of my ideas...maybe some are stupid or some are planned for the game but in all i think this game has potential and i dont wona be disapointed.

It's still in alpha so there are a few bugs here and there but it hasn't affected my gameplay and I keep coming back to play it. The buggiest part of the game is the waiting area while the match is being populated (which doesn't bother me at all because it's not like it counts or anything). Besides this I can't complain. In the future I would like to see a different map in another part of the world with different geography and architecture.One thing I like is the role that vehicles play in the game. Yes they can get you from point A to B faster but they are ridiculously loud. So the vehicles are balanced in such a way that they give the user an advantage (faster mobility) and a disadvantage (giving away position).If you like shooters frustration campers camping survival games etc. then I totally recommend this game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Cons Network connection especially in the beggining of games alot of the time rubberbanding and teleporting can happen for a couple of minutes before the server settles. Bugs probably the most annoying one is when you start a game land in between some houses and neither of them load you are just stood there with some low poly models and cant enter anywhere and loot leaving you vulnerable other than that there are some minor bugs here and there which can annoy you.TL DR Basiclly King of the kill but better polished.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-04-15,0,0,94,True,Recommended,"tl dr Great gameplay spotty optimization overall recommend While I recommend this game I feel the need to point out that this game could use some work in optimization and and fluidity. The game itself is a blast to play (I know I have a small amount of hours but I spent time playing it on a friend's account) and it is even more fun if you team up with friends. The implementation of the battle royale in this game is far superior to that of H1Z1. There are a couple things that can be improved. This is mainly optimization. I struggle to get 60 fps with medium settings at 1440p with a pretty hefty graphics card (980ti). However I feel the developers will fix this within the coming months. Another thing that annoys me (however not to the extent of the optimization) is the fact that textures do not fully ""load in"" or sharpen until a couple seconds after I start the battle. These things can all be fixed with time and I have no doubt in my mind that the devs are working their hardest to do this. Overall I would recommend this game to anyone who felt that H1Z1 was a dissapointment this game helps make up for that hole that was left by it for me. Just beware of some of the performance issues and lack of optimization going around right now.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I know the game is laggy buggy toxic (racial cursing etc.) and it can be a real frustration sometimes but I would still strongly recommend it to those who love ArmA like millitary shooters and would like to try a faster paced game. Overall the gun handling should be similar to what you expect from a realistic shooter and the inventory system is greatly simplified as compared to ArmA. Shooting is fun looting is fun and driving is fun as long as you can tolerate and ignore occasional glitches.

2017-04-13,0,0,166,True,Recommended,I had been looking for a game like this for a long time. Even in its alpha stage its quite good. Run around solo coop or in a team of 4 in a game close to 100 players. There is never a shortage of people playing and your queue literally takes a few seconds. The game You are dropped via airplane with 100 other players onto an island. You have to forage for weapons and accessories while not getting killed by other players doing the same thing. You are then forced into a smaller and smaller area until you cannot help but see other people and fight. The game lasts until the last man is standing or your team is still standing. Its not easy to be the last one I've only done it once but the adrenaline rush and the fun is always different and satisfying. The Cons obviously this game is in early access. The game has some SERIOUS lag problems where you will literally freeze for 10 30 seconds. Sometimes it doesn't happen sometimes it seems like ever minute it does. The devs are aware of this and working on it. The game also isn't optimized and so even great computer rigs will struggle to get consistency. All in all great game. With the bugs in mind I'd give it a 7/10 but after they fix the lag problems i'd move it to a 10/10,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-04-13,0,0,422,True,Recommended,Intense and realistic game. Bullet trajectory and gun recoil makes it feel extremely realistic where proper aim is needed.

2017-04-20,0,0,73,True,Recommended,It s a mixture of Arma 3 and H1Z1 less arcade than H1Z1 and more survival cos kills don't count as much as the strategic tactical and survival skills the player needs to achive the meaning of the game SURVIVE!!!The game is still in early access so nothing much to say about it. Of course still a lot of things to be fixed and improved graphic quality for me it's cool enough just needs to be setted up properly to avoid FPS's drop in certain situation which is a pain cos it can cost u the whole round. Latency is not massively effecting the game even if sometimes makes your shooting impossibile due to a not fluid and consistent flaw but we can live (for the moment) with that. The gameplay side is fun but with a slow pace no running and gunning around but finding the right spot to hide to search for ammunitions weapons and whatever items to improve your HP and resistences is essencial. Cars and bikes are available too but forget the jumping out the car while running cos it will only kill u (like in reality) ). The weapons are still underway to be balanced properly and depending of the situation the right choice at the right moment will keep u alive in most of the situations. Different kind of scoope equipment cloths helms weapon's attachments and as much things as u need to survive will be found around the 8x8 km map with cities and villages to be searched and discovered.It also gives you the chance to play in 3 differents mode Solo Duo or Team mode. ( team mode is so fun).I'll stop here my review cos honestly really too early to give a solid statement but i can tell you that PERSONALLY i've got a very good impression about this game and I'm sure it will give the players what they deserve seen the game is sold at 26 sterlins ish and still not completed.

2018-04-19,0,0,1254,False,Not Recommended,I am an old player. In this update I think it is unreasonable to have seven days trading restrictions on items acquired through new pay boxes. First the player who wants to have a skin is difficult to get the skin for the first time like my players who have already filled up the money to buy the skin causing a lot of regret. Second I think there are seven days trading restrictions are unnecessary and there is no positive significance. Third you didn't tell the players this behavior in advance. This is a need to solicit the players' opinions. Most importantly this affects the game experience very much. I hope you can solve this important problem again in the hot update.

2017-04-29,0,0,607,False,Not Recommended,Honestly I do love this game and it was very fun at first but here are some glaring issues nowadays. Battle Royale is getting out of hand and im ing tired of it. We are buying games loaded with microtransactions bugs and server issues it is more punishing than rewarding. The game had a lot of potential and still does but now with new games that offer a different experience it is time for this phase to die in gaming. You should save your money for games that you are hyped for and are good vs an unpolished game that renders it a good amount of time unplayable. Again don't get me wrong it is fun but BR is not fun. They have an event mode called war mode which is basically a massive battle where you drop with guns and duke it out and respawn. It is fun it is so fun it reminds me of when shooters just had a respawn mechanic not a survival over fun mechanic.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-05-30,0,0,28,False,Recommended,"Review update As I promised I am changing my review due to the fact the game works for me again. I don't know what they did but after about two weeks of the game crashing constantly I can finally play. I still don't condone them sueing the devs of Fornite nor do I condone the selling of skins being treated as more important then fixing the game. But I have to say man is it good to play again. I really enjoy this game and I do recommend it for people who enjoy the battle royale genre. If you're not sure that you'll like it try Fortnite on for size. It isn't quite the same and to be honest I dislike Fortnite after playing a few matches but it may help you decide if the genre is right for you before purchasing this title. Below the little quote thing I do to end these reviews is my first review for the game that I wrote when my game was broken. Take it with a grain of salt but know many of my opinions still stand.""Shots from the uh... northwest."" *shots from the east* ""No that can't be right..."" Cmdr. V. J. Perrin while being flanked by one or more enemy groups.Old review I loved this game. It was a genre that I wasn't sure I would like and actively tried to avoid. But one of my friends bought me this game and urged me to try it. Let me tell you I'm glad they did. It quickly became one of my favorite games to play with friends and I couldn't understand why people disliked it. Then BlueHole started rolling out ""performance patches"". Now I understand that PUBG really needs performance updates but the problem is since the implementation of said patches mine and many others games have become unplayable. The game will crash constantly and the crash report will crash too. Now if you are a gaming company that just broke thousands of peoples games with a patch that would fix the other thousands of peoples already broken games would you a). Work hard on patches that would make the game more stable for everyone play test them then release them so everyone can play or b). Sue another game company the made a free game that is the same genre but different enough that it isn't breaching copyright and is also mostly if not totally bug free while also being actually free.That's right everyone PUBG is sueing Fortnite instead of actually fixing their game. I only have ten hours in this game because after that amount of playtime my game broke and now it is actually unplayable. Thanks BlueHole.If they fix their game and make it so I can actually play I'll update my review.""Why don't I just play Fortnite you say? Well cadets it's because I've already purchased skins.""

But going back and watching the game replays and they're looking and shooting at me and other player through walls snapping onto target and it's easily seen they are not playing fair.

Solo gets boring after a few games the games longevity is in the squad games. Whether its randoms or friends it gives you a second chance to revive. This is better played with friends as we all know randoms are hit and miss.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-05-01,0,0,201,False,Recommended,The One That Started The Battle Royal Boom This is the game planned by PLAYERUKNOWN who made Battle Royal mode for Arma 2. This is a game developed by Bluehole Studio that made cash grab RPG games TERA. Most of the Over the medium Korean game companies only wants money. Like Nexon Netmable Hangame etc. But this was little bit different this game wasn t fully cash grab. This is a few game that passed Early Access state. Yeah there was some argument about it yet it was succesfully launched. No pay to win item added in the game and game itself keep improving! I was suprised that this game made by Korean company. Solid gameplay nice grapics optimizing is keep getting nicer new contents added in the game now and then server is getting improvements and most of all it s not full price only $39.99. If you think about it most of the AAA Publishers would sell this at full price like $49.99 $59.99. They know how to make and improve the game. But knowing making the game is not everything that makes game perfect. The one and important thing to make perfect game is publishing and polishing the game. They promised the users that We ll not add the random box supply drop thingy until game is officially released. But they broke that promise. They promised users that We ll keep the users between Korean Kakao server user &amp Steam Korean server user. But they broke that promise and said We ll split the user base. And they also failed that. Also this game doesn t have proper anti cheats so that hackers rave though server punishes player that doesn t use the hacks. So do i recommend this game or not? They broke all their promises doesn t catch cheaters that well they don t have skills to polish their game. But they made it good and solid. Despite the facts that they don t keep the game well but game itself is very good. Also they re keep improving generic gameplays. Also they tested new maps and guns so i m hoping they add them soon. If you want to play the original well made battle royal game you need to consider this game.Pros Nice graphics Solid gameplays like gun shooting driving vehicles etc Relatively cheap prices New contents added now and thenCons They don t fulfill promises Doesn t have proper anti cheats Server needs more improvements,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-05-07,0,0,370,True,Recommended,Great Game Overall has it's flaws obviously what can you expect of a Early Access game...?Overall i think this is one of the most fun games i've played aswell as you really get drawn into the game the fights are intense and i don't think i've had so much fun playing with mates before. If you are a fan of Strategy and stuff like that i want to really Recommend you buying this game. If you get together with friends you can make some solid tactics and have loads of fun!I don't think i've played a game before that makes my adrenaline kick in like this game. Yes as i said this game has it's flaws it can lagg and very close combat can feel clunky but just the little amount of time i've played this game i have seen improvements and i believe this game will end up being extremely good. Atleast i hope so! Even with this game's flaws i would say it is worth it's current price and i have played this game over 48 hours in a week. I guess that says enough of how much i've enjoyed this game. Keep in mind that this is a early access game and what i say in this review might be completely irrelevant when you read this. Note the post date of this review.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-05-07,0,0,20,True,Recommended,this is a really fun and tense game. sure its rough around the edges but the interactions you have every game are really cool. hearing someone walking around the house your looting makes your heart beat fast. it is pretty hard though. mostly because i really really suck. but still a whole lot of fun.8/10 would suck at this game again,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-05-06,0,0,15,True,Recommended,"I was on the fence about buying this game given all of the negative reviews but I've got to say I don't regret it at all. I've really enjoyed what I've played so far and I've not had any issues with gameplay aside from a few small bouts of lag.I've been a huge fan of the Battle Royale franchise for well over a decade now and I've been waiting for someone to create a videogame that truly did the concept justice. I feel like this is the one I've been waiting for. It's still in Early Access so it of course needs a lot of fine tuning but the player base is active and involved and it seems like the dev has enough passion for this project to see it through to the end. $30 may be a little steep for an Early Access game but I feel like it's worth it in this case.Edit Now that I've got a few more matches under my belt I've definitely experienced some issues. I've had two games completely freeze on me. If you get this game in Early Access brace yourself for that frustration. There's nothing quite like reaching the bottom 30 well armed and feeling like you've got a shot at victory...... and then having the game freeze. For some reason I handled it a lot better than I thought I would. I suppose going into the game knowing that I'm not going to win anyways makes it fun in a whole different way.People complain about ""luck"" and RNGs having such a heavy hand in the way the matches turn out but that's what I love most about it. I've had a game where I parachuted into a cluster of houses and walked out with two assault rifles a handgun and more ammo than I should realistically be able to carry. This last game I spent 20 minutes running around the map and only managed to find a 12ga with 20 shells and a partially loaded 1911. I had a ton of mods for guns I didn't have though.I absolutely love that variability and it makes it so much more tense. You never know who you're going to come across next and how lucky they've been. I've lucked out and run across a player that hadn't even found a pair of pants.... and then shortly after run right into the sights of a fully equipped sharpshooter.You won't win every game. You won't win most games. You just have to see how long you can survive with what you're given.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-05-07,0,0,217,True,Recommended,It's a fun game that actually requires skill. There is a steep learning curve so prepare to lose a lot when playing at first. Also winning is difficult for even the best players as they only win at most around 10% of all games they play (even 10% may be pushing it lol).There are some glitches but the developers do try and fix them quickly. Sometimes you'll get caught on little pebbles or bushes when driving.Is it worth $30? I'd say yes even though it's an early access game. It's quite addicting and the feel you get when you find good loot or when you kill someone is quite gratifying. It's also worth mentioning the game is poorly optimized which is unfortunate and is something the developers should really work on.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-05-08,0,0,41,True,Recommended,Great games. Just bought it 2 days ago. Spent 11 hrs on it. To some players it's maybe a game where you rackup the most kills but to me it is about who can survive the longest.My strategy is to avoid crowded place i always try to jump as a late as possible so i dont have to worry about other players and concentrate in finding the best weapons and armor while slowly advancing to the safe zone. If i'm lucky enough to be in the safe zone it will give me plenty of time to find a killing spot and waits other players closing in. With a map that is so big it's really fun to find a place to ambush others. And usually all the last 20 30 players have got a decent weapons and armor and are quite ready for any ambush and confrontation. And when it gets to 10 last player the safe zone are so small it would definetly create confrontation which can come from any direction.The character movement is quite good but still not as good as the division like cover behind wall or objects. The weapons aiming is not quite realistic cause there's no movement (you dont even need to hold your breath for a steady aim).Overall this game is quite good i'm really looking forward to how this game will be develop. And i jope the develper will put enouh effort to stop cheaters and hacker that could ruin the games.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-05-03,0,0,19,False,Recommended,It's fun but there are a few glaring issues that need fixing Projectile weapons are great but the crosshairs are basically useless since they don't adjust for the trigonometry between the target the weapon and the crosshairs. An offline practice mode is a must have for a game like this which has far more complex gameplay elements. 2 hours of offline practice (not even with bots just targets) would be more beneficial than 50 hours of painful and frustrating grinding. IMO every melee weapon should have a secondary use. The frying pan can block bullets so let the crowbar open special crates let the machete have a bleeding damage effect or let you throw the sickle. Maybe let you use your pistol when you are knocked but at half the rate of fire no aiming down sights and no reloading just to make the gunfights a bit more flavourful and interesting.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Sadly All them are still not here after all this time. Lag spike and even frame rate issues occur at the start of each match mid to late game.

So I set up all of my controls to my xbox one controls then I hit aply so I went to a game and I coulnt move so I go back to my controls and they where all blank so I set my key bord controls back to normal and I hit aply and OK. Then when I went into a game I still couldnt move so I go back to the controls and they where all blank again I tryed everything I could to get my controls back to normal but it just wouldnt work. I tried to uninstalling the game and reinstalling and I restarted my computer but nothing would work so I just gave up on it.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-04-29,0,0,156,True,Recommended,"Now I haven't played too much of it but I have enough to say that it's a GOOD game. Gunplay is satisfying and the sounds are amazing (good thing too cuz sound is very important here). I'd never played a ""Battle Royal"" game before so instead of taking a chance with this game I played around with Last Man Standing (the free2pay knockoff of PUBG) for about 10 hrs. To be honest it took about 10min for me to get hooked on it. PLAYERUNKNOWN has everything customizable characters gun modifiers lots of guns (and the promise to add more) good visuals (GTX 1070 and i7 6700k gets 60fps on a mix of high and ultra) efficient matchmaking and reliable servers (so far). You can also play in first and third person view. The map is creative and immersive with little secrets here and there. With the developper's promise that Early Access will be done in six months (1 month down as of April 23) 30 36$ is a very reasonable price for the game.8/10 The only con is that loot boxes (purely cosmetic stuff) are wayyy too expensive.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

This can be a game breaking glitch especially when the game ends there. We also would like more optomization fixes and possibly a deathmatch mode so It will be easier for us to do Tryouts for our new recruits . We would also appriciate it to be easier to make custom games and possibly make it easier to add people on steam through pubg or see the recent people you have played with. Another thing that my clan is would like to request is a way to set clan tags and even create clans in pubg with the ability to see the average kdr of the clan and the average win ratio of the clan.

2017-08-03,0,0,1492,True,Not Recommended,Was loving it until they introduced paid mechanics before fixing server issues and performance problems. Actually they relesed paid mecahnics and introduced more lag and this shows that their priorities were not set right.EDIT 19 October 2017 Despite getting so much money they didn't deliver on promised new map vehicles and vaulting. To this day there are frustrating bugs. In the past 2 months they held a tournament and started to work on the XBOX version of the game instead of fixing the PC version from whch they earned the money from. They are on their way to another tournament already and no good updates in sight.There are people still drooling over this game that's because compared to other online games in the same genre this one looks graphically attractive and has better gameplay but if you only look at what we paid them and what they delivered then they failed to deliver on their promises and are only partnering up with other companies to earn more and more. Already Nvidia shadowplay has been incorporated into the game instead of having some custom technology without adverts.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-05-28,0,0,335,False,Not Recommended,Addictive but frustrating. Devs are more focused on making money than they are on making a game. The zone times are still far too short leading to end game being luck based. The short zone times allow next to no fighting in the late game as stopping AT ALL will lead to you being engulfed in the zone and killed. This also means it's a frequent occurance to be killed by teams/people sitting in or on the very edge of the zone in places that should be deemed out of play. The early game is of course as all battle royale games luck based but is the only point in the game where you can have a definite firefight without the risk of the zone killing you. Mid game is essentially a running simulator where you put your weapon to your back and autorun while alt+tabbed for 10 minutes until you arrive at the next zone. Netcode is reminiscent of Battlefield 4's launch cheaters still ruin games and dreadful performance leads to crashes in the late game or frame drops on smokes. Expect a free to play model on a paid game very unfortunate.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2018-07-29,0,0,388,False,Not Recommended,Would be a good game and some of them can be fun but my god does it run like garbage. The amount of desync and server lag is pathetic for a game out for so long. If they fix all or most of the problems with the functionality of the game then i'd happily recommend the game. However their current patch system seems to be fix one break two and considering they have had over 7 months since the full release to improve it it doesn't bode well that at its core it's still in an absolute shocking state.I continue to check back every once in a while to see if they've made improvements because I actually like the game and hope it's better but every single time it disappoints.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-10-18,0,0,26,True,Not Recommended,This game is just a giant cash cow.So this is what I think about the game.ProsFun and exciting.Involves some tactical thinking of combat situations created by other players.No playtrough is the same for any weapons found is something different with each round.Cons High chance of being banned if a streamer reports you even without any solid evidence. Lots of bugs and crashes. Broken promises over micro transactions which they now have. The removing of free loot crates. (You have to buy your winnings now.) In game adds.Streamers are loved by the developers because they provide lots of positive PR and thus money. But even though Bluehole has sold over 100 million copies they decide to get more money off their existing player base to get into some games competition. So that keep me questioning... Why is the game still buged? They are charging you 30 to play than another 2 to collect your price. So that's why I'm giving this game a negative review.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-10-18,0,0,435,True,Not Recommended,It's an asset flip mainly put together with third party materials and no programming on the part of the developers. It doesn't help that it's a good idea for a game when no real effort is put into its development. It got big primarily on account of Youtubers misrepresenting the game through edited videos and mum criticism which in turn have earned them direct preferential treatment by the developers. Even if money has not changed hands there are obvious linking without disclaimers going on.Add to that the broken promises not to monetize the game before it's done not that it looks to ever be done by the pace of the development so far. The 100+ millions of dollars of revenue are not put into the game not even spent at good enough servers to handle the amount of players. (In practice the PC community is mostly funding and beta testing for the upcoming console launch.) Technically speaking this game has one of the very worst online experience of todayus shooters even rivaling games that run on a peer to peer basis.That even the silly bug which defaulted the game launcher for everyone to asian servers took months to fix shows the low bar that the owners of this company have set. It's all about milking this trash for what it's worth. I see no reason not to expect that some time next year it could even be abandoned. IF we're lucky they'll then at least launch a serious project on a new game since this will need to be rebuilt from the ground up anyway. That's the best you can really hope for at this point. Enjoy the beta testing.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

There is many ways to play and enjoy it. The bad Despite all the success improvements to the game have been very underwhelming and I suspect the team behind it is either very small or of questionable skill. Not only that but they are very greedy and have diverted alot of ressources to micro transaction console versions and planned mobile versions and that before the game was even out of early access. Also every second game is filled with laggers and cheaters. The NA servers are filled with high ping thirdworlders who don't speak a lick of english so you better have friends online or be ready to play nothing but solo.At this pont im just waiting for real developpers to come around and create a better battle royale so that I can jump ship.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-05-21,0,0,378,False,Not Recommended,Full disclosure. I have had some genuinely fun experiences on PUBG however these were much further back in development. During the Early Access there was a steady stream of content with just a small selection of freely dropped items and it felt like a fresh professional game. There are a lot of odd changes and rushed content that feels out of place. I don't think I would have enjoyed it as much in it's current state of affairs therefore I have to give a thumbs down review.One thing to note that may not be obvious to the trend is that this is a Korean game despite not looking like the general MMO it does encorporate a lot of the business models of the nature. It may mean the item systems feel alien for you compared to regular FPS shooters if you haven't played a Korean MMO/Mobile game before. 'Gatcha' style item systems are very popular in the asian market and hugely unpopular in the western market where you gamble on items for money on essentially low reward. It is very similar to loot boxes in games like TF2 or Overwatch but the chances are generally very low. Unfortunately on PUBG the common items look very poor and the good stuff will cost you money. Its a common thing in Korean games to make their income outside of the single purchase. The game has also taken on it's success very badly. The way the devs have branded themselves under 'PUBG Corp' going for a very businessy model with a lot of non gaming industry management and seemingly making updates purely for the sake of making money over improving the game leaves a bad taste in my mouth given I have had some fun on here previously. I'm not saying the change is negative but for my own western expectations I feel like I'm getting very little enjoyment out of changes that seem to frow back and forth.To give an example the M16 used to be very strong at long range so rather than plan changes to adjust it's damage at range they just made it impossible to fit an 8X scope or higher on it despite the capability on the real gun. Later they made a change to 'average out' the stats of Assault rifles along with releasing new scopes so that ARs in general aren't as strong in long range engagements. However they don't back out the original change now that it isn't really relevant so the gun is in an odd spot compared to its other compadres. Trading on third party websites causes a loss of revenue for PUBG corp and is a practice that steam are wanting to do away with in general. Rather than trying to make up a suggestion they have removed in game trading until they can come up with an permanent solution which has left some people losing a LOT of money on third party sites because they can't get their items/income back. Changes like this would have been great to plan in advance to give people chance to recuperate. A last complaint would be that there are still optimisation problems present stuff that has been ongoing since the Early Access. The devs will work to resolve the problems and you get to a fantastic framerate but a new update will come out purely days after and it's back to frame problems to push some new unimpressive skin you have no chance of obtaining a new temporary mode that's generally just there to test some new mechanic or removing old content from the game in place of something to make it easier for new players. I digress. All in all for 26.99 you'll get one of the best battle royale experiences out there and to play the game for the first few times is very thrilling. The game is much better played with friends and there is certainly replay value. Unfortunately with the development path this game has been taking in 2018 so far I have to severely recommend against buying this game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-01-24,0,0,97,False,Recommended,You're probably reading through the horde of negative reviews right now wondering whether to buy the game. Don't be discouraged. I'm gonna be real here.You see people who have put in over 500 hours into PUBG contradict themselves by giving the game a bad review. If the game kept you excited entertained and enthrawled enough to play for 500 hours ask yourself is it really a bad game? Why are you playing this HORRIBLE game for 500 hours? Don't you have anything better to do than play a game you don't like?It seems like everyone is bandwagoning on hating the game (it has a 4.5/10 user score on metacritic compared to a 8.5/10 critic score). And yet their problems don't revolve around the gameplay itself but more the external issues.Chinese hackers... fps lag... server de sync... etc...Personally I've encountered very little of this. And even if I did were these problems to be so big then PUBG wouldn't have a chance at becoming the biggest game on Steam which it will be for a long time forward.But if you look at the game itself then oh boy you're in for one hell of a thrill ride. Being in the top 10 players is the undisputably most butt clenchingly intense gaming experience I have ever had. To get that kind of feeling in real life would be downright life threatening. I'll let you discover the rest for youself.So if you've a got a decent PC a pair of stereo headphones and no life then you should probably buy this game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-05-14,0,0,19,True,Recommended,"Never played a Battle Royal style game before so here's my review on my first 5 or so hours. (may update).When I first started playing this my first thought was ""This is like the Leage of Legends version of Rust"".In the sense that you jump into a match and if you do good then great! But if you have a crappy match then ""ah well onto the next match"". There's no long term consequece to having a bad match. Unlke a game like Rust that might make your rage quit the game all togther rather than just take a break. Funnily enough in my second game I'd actually come 1st! I was the lone surviver and even got a kill doing so! But I didn't earn anything rather than a bunch of money to spend towards a crate. I'd have thought that coming 1st would at least earn you a crate or some cool looking gear to show off to everyone you can came 1st once!Following on from my paragraph above I think the reward system needs a bit of a boost (especially since the crates get more expensive everytime you get 1). EDIT I REALISED THAT CRATE PRICE GOES BACK DOWN TO 700 AFTER 24 HOURS In a match I've literally just finish before writing this review I'd come 10th in a game which earned me the Top 10 bonus (which is a nice start to improving the reward system) and I'd earned myself 2 whopping kills! Since this is a survival game 2 kills is an okay amount to know I earned my spot in the Top 10. And these were 2 well earned kills too! Stalking my pray and waiting for the right moment. Felt really rewarding once I'd destroyed them. However when I looked at how much money I'd earned from my overall points once and those 2 kills only netted me a whopping 40 points!! I got 32 points for just hitting someone with my bullets so to get 40 points with 2 kills was pretty disheartening. HOWEVER THIS IS A VERY FUN GAME!!

Thumbs up for the idea... for the execution not so much.You can manually select the server you play on resulting in people from other continents playing on servers located in your region. Those people have a bad ping hence your hits don't register.In my opinion the gunplay needs lots of work. Hits don't register (which is as mentioned above partly caused by Australians Russians and Asians playing on EU server) you need to hit a whole mag into the enemy until he goes down (but isn't dead yet) headshots never kill. Although this may be intentional I personally don't like it. And I suck at shooting in this game. Oh well.On my end mouse input seems laggy or clunky in general. Even though I slide my mouse fluidly the game somehow manages to show a ""wobbly"" camera/aim movement.Some sounds are way too loud (I'm looking at you airplane) while others are too quiet.Anyway I will follow the game's development as it's definitely an interesting game which unfortunately has quite a vew problams at the moment.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

That being said 8/10 matches wont have a HACKER. But it is a problem. The fact they don't allow region locking is silly not racist. The developer sold a lot of the company to a damn hacker company out of china and that's why there is such a big problem. Im sure they might have not known but still. Overall even with the crazy glitch here and there or a hacker the game is still a solid 7/10. But it still needs a lot of work.

So I wrote to them asking why this has happend.The answer was ""We can assure you that the account was blocked because there was a violation discovered on the account. We apologize but we cannot provide any specifics on the details of the violation.Therefore we do not accept any requests for rechecking account restrictions.""I think it's good that they are trying to get cheaters I've never seen a player whom I even tought was cheating and I really like that. But the system fails if someone who doesn't deserv it gets banned and with zero explanation (they say its for preventing cheaters to understand the system so I guess its ""okey"" even if its very annoying.)

2017-05-16,0,0,216,True,Recommended,"PUBGs is a good game. The adrenaline and pounding heart when you hear footsteps within a very small play area is hard to match in any other game. The weapons are varied enough and for the most part have their different strengths and weaknesses. A cautious or heads on playstyle can be achieved regardless of where the plane flies in and unlike H1Z1 you aren't at a major disadvantage because someone has a faster PC than you. The game is exactly how you expect it to be and is seriously fun especially when played in a squad with friends.Downsides ""I'm a snake follow me."" Theres also a split second when loading into the plane that everyones mic seems to quadruple in decibels and can cause temporary deafness. This can be avoided by turning your mic to team only though but sometimes it's good to hear other people chatting so you can get the drop on them.Recently (since yesterday maybe) the game seems a lot laggier. I witnessed my friend being shot around a wall and then experienced it for myself. Hopefully this can be sorted soon. My biggest problem though is the major gamebreaking bug a stun grenade has a very high chance of outright crashing your game and I think they should be disabled til the problem is resolved.

2017-05-17,0,0,26,True,Recommended,In all honesty the game is fun in doses. I've played about an hour or so and its kinda already starting to get old. The best rounds are with friends and whilst the game is the sort that creates it's own stories (dropped into a place and fist fought a guy over a helmet to the death) often you'll spend 20 40 min getting loot nervously running about between houses hiding in rooms and waiting to kill any er that walks in because you heard your own footsteps and then turning your back and being shot from behind and killed before you can react. Getting to the last 2 is easy. Sit wait camp with a shotgun in the centre of a circle. Then die because the other guy planned your death before you installed the game and lined up the headshot whilst you jumped out of the plane.It's a great game but play with friends and then maybe 1 or 2 rounds a day if you really like it but more might make the game feel somewhat repetitive. Best early access game to date though. Long Dark Sail Etc all need to learn from this.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-05-15,0,0,18,False,Not Recommended,Product received for free. Playerunknowns Battlegrounds is a fun game with friends but is very much unfinished in it's current state. I'm sure you have already seen gameplay and know what the game is about so I'll just skip to my personal opinions. I think the developers really need to lower PUBG's price of admission especially considering the success of it's free to play main competitor Fortnite Battle Royale. 30 dollars feels like way too much for a game that doesn't even run at 100 + frames on my high end PC. It also baffles me that the developers feel the need to add random loot crate purchases to a game that feels clunky to control and is dizzying to look at.Please don't mistake me though... The game is fun to play. There's no doubt that hopping on the back of a motorcycle with your best buddy driving only to crash violently into a rock and die is stupid fun! Gathering a party of four into a pickup truck and gunning down other players on the street is the kind of experience you look for with games like these.That being said I just can't recommend a 30 dollar game when (arguably) better alternatives namely Darwin Project and Fortnite are free to play and run great on my computer.Thanks for the free copy Brayden!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

PUBG still needs way more optimization it still runs like xEdit 2018 05 31 Update #14 improved tick rate FPS during gunfights and when dropping frame times. Not so sure about items spawning late though. I'd have to test it some more. The patch has restored my faith in the game.Some context I caved in to the hype bought this game and started playing after 1.0 release at around January taking a leap of faith despite the mixed reviews at the time.After 650+ hours of hoping it gets better I can honestly say I don't recommend buying this game in it's current abysmal state. It just seems that the core gameplay problems that I've experienced from the start haven't been fixed or don't look anywhere near being fixed AFAICT.Rubber banding is still a thing even when playing on the newly added SEA solo and duo FPP queues. Loot spawning waaay after you land happens too much it somewhat disincentivizes learning to chute well. Hell even the very basic action of picking items up is pretty hit or miss. I've had many instances where desync causes me to get hit after getting back into cover. And the FPS drops maaaan. This is the only game in recent memory where I've tried setting everything to very low and it still runs like crap. Dropping hot in school hacienda or wherever there's a lot of people is an exhilarating but ultimately frustrating experience when all of the aforementioned problems combined just start happening all at once.Many other BR games and modes are just around the corner especially with COD BO4 announcing theirs. What could be the final nail in the coffin for PUBG I think is when Battlefield comes out with their own BR. Unless... UNLESS the devs start getting competent fast and making even just the core gameplay experience smooth. all the other features more crates. Hell even gun and general gameplay balance. Just make the gameplay smooth FFS.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Weapons feel different and satifying to use Most guns have a fairly solid punchy sound to accompany their excellent models. Full body awareness is gorgeous and works well albeit wishing I could adjust FOV to be slightly larger in first person. The vehicles handle well and are more or less free of jenky physics. Party and skydive system is excellent and works great Third person serves as more of a view assistance rather than the superior aiming method as bullets come from your gun not your camera.CONS Stability is an issue at this time sometimes my friends and I can get into consecutive games without a problem and other times we have to quit a match 3 5 times in a row just to play a match together. That being said once we are in the starting plane we are crash free with the exception of one time which may be chalked up to his computer.Latency can be a bit rough while the game ""plays fine"" visually sometimes interacting with an item can take a moment which is primarily an issue with getting in and out of vehicles in a panic situation resulting in getting and out of the vehicle mutliple times. FIXED Expanding on the latency issue this can result in some frustrating close range fire fights typically only when in close quarters as someone pushing around a corner can shoot you without even being around the corner on your screen if their ping is high enough. It's pretty rare to encounter someone with such a high latency but it has happened a couple times.*They now have movement and trigger locking when someones ping is too high.* Performance can result in some dodgy frame rates at higher settings but it is more or less exempt from this point at the moment as it is early access. Lack of mantling can be a tad frustrating. Lacking the ability to climb over low surfaces can be a slight issue sometimes not being able to jump over something you could easily tumble over can be frustrating.Overall 8/10EXCELLENT Last Man Standing Shooter Does the genre justice",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-06-25,0,0,3,False,Not Recommended,"I really want to like this game but I just can't see how anyone would consider this game ""competitive"" in the current state that it's in. To name a few glaring issues The netcode in this game is terrible. Even when I join games with low ping on my 120 mb/s internet I still get rubberbanding and hit registration issues. Mouse issues. This game has both mouse lag and mouse smoothing which are big no nos for competitive shooters. There's also no way to fix this so all that shooting practice in CSGO isn't going to help you at all. Cheaters Call me Xenophobic if you want but about 99% of the cheaters I've encountered in this game are from China or South Korea. A region lock would fix this problem at least for us Americans instantly. Team killers. Again this is a problem coming from Asian players. If you don't speak their language then they will instantly kill you for no reason. Bugs galore. Dying from getting a door closed on you? Check. Vehicle randomly bouncing up into the air and exploding? Check. Textures not loading? Check? The circle of death. This is a problem that the developers never seemed to have adressed. You get a vast detailed map yet you can only explore the center of it or else you'll get zapped by the quickly collapsing circle. If you just so happen to land far outside of the circle then you have to spend the entire game chasing the boundries only to get shot while running. If you're not fast enough then too bad. The circle collapses faster than you can possibly sprint so you may be a few feet away from the boundry but unable to make it in bounds before you die or get shot. I understand what the circle is for but when half the server is killed by the out of bounds area then it kind of takes the fun out of the game. Otherwise I really want to like this game but I can't recommend it at its current state.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I read reviews about lag rubberbanding HORRIBLE graphics especially on the foliage in game negative reviewers said that devs made the foliage look exceptionally well in the screen shots on the game page but actual in game graphics were by far below standard. Of course there's countless other negative reviews I'm not mentioning but those were SOME of the one's that made me hesitant of purchasing this game you know with all of the BAD games being put out there now that are passing as GOOD games and even GREAT games I am very skeptical about what to purchase as of late. Let me tell you now if any of the above mentioned reasons is why your'e not getting this game DO NOT WORRY ABOUT THAT. THIS GAME RUNS AS SMOOTH AS A HOT KNIFE THROUGH MELTED BUTTER!!!! Now I also have to believe that the game running so up to hype standards is or could be because of my above average Machine I play games on... If you own a machine that has problems playing minecraft on the lowest settings than you also have no business Writing a negative review on a beautifully made kept up with and time consuming piece of art such as PUBG. Before purchasing the game pay attention to the minimum and recommended hardware and software requirements and also know how to operate your own machine know how to maximize your machines' performance not only for this game but for all games and if you can figure out how to do that than this game will be the most fun amazing and played item in your STEAM Library. Every review now has pros and cons and they are all the same... PROS * the game runs great * the game looks great * the game is the best thing since the last best that was better than the thing that was put out before it that it replaced... CONS * The bad things are obvious the trees look like sponges * The bullets don't kill fast enough/too fast * The game lags so bad * The rubberbanding will pull me back one KILOMETER and when my guy finally gets to where he was supposed to be I'M DEAD.... So with those examples of the reviews people are putting up about this game I wont' go there because those are just not the case I mean the PROS are but the way they are put together is embarassing and need to be more maticulate at least out of respect for the Devs these one's in particular these guys put together something that probably no one thought would succeed because 90% of games today are built around the same or similar ideas kill kill kill and if possible in the end survive. Somehow these guys did it and with the game STILL ONLY IN EARLY ACCESS at that... they made this work and also made it not only likeable but loveable!!! I have only as said before 4 hours on record but I have followed this game since the beginning watching videos and getting that ""ITCH"" to play it even though I didn't have it and it was driving me nuts so I purchased it yesterday downloaded like a charm booted up set up created character launched into my first battle royale!!! I when my character was loading into the map was the ONLY lag I hit so farbut I assume that was only because there was 96 people in the room with me and for all that to load in I can accept a little lag for about 3 seconds than smoothness!!! so the plane ride in to the parachoot was fun than we land and the killing starts and I mean it STARTS with people raiding houses the second they hit ground load the guns they find slam some ammo in the bastard BAM BAM BAM until they or everyone around them falls short of life... With all of that being said I will leave you to make your own conclusion just remember that if you do get this game know that it's on you and our equipment how it runs because it is not on the Developers they did a fantastic job with this Early Access piece of platinum!!! THIS GAME DESERVES ALL THE HYPE THAT HAS SURROUNDED IT... obviously there are some things that can be worked on such as the area of play that closes in on you faster than the flash on speed and after your're outside of that ""little blue line"" your health depletes even faster than the blue line that moved in on you I think it's punishment enough being outside of the play area and out of the fight instead of killing you while you're outside the line maybe make it so said player can't win or participate in airdrops they have to make it back to the area of play in order to get full access to their arsenal and/or the game they're in and when they are back all of their inventory items can be restored and used or something along those lines... anyways the game is amazing and I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE THAT IS OF AGE TO PLAY THIS GAME AND WHO LOVES THESE KINDS OF GAMES IF YOU DON'T LIKE THESE GAMES AND GET THIS AND DON'T LIKE IT DO NOT REVIEW IT THAT'S JUST BEING A JERK and not needed here or in the world... So with my 200% Recomendation of this AMAZING game I really hope you decide to give it a try and love it as much as I do because these guys deserve a huge pat on the back for this... A HUGE THANK YOU TO THE DEVELOPERS and their families for the patience it had to take to create such a masterpeice!!!! To you reading this play the game check you system settings and do what you can to not be a stooge and have your machine running at optimum performance so you can enjoy this game and not be like the negative nags that don't know it's their machine that's holding the game up not the game itself it's not enough to have a bad*** machine alone you have to know how to adjust the settings to said maching there's alot more to it than just the in game settings.... BUY PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS PLAY IT ENJOY IT LOVE IT AND MOST OF ALL SUPPORT IT ALSO PLEASE I'D LOVE TO SEE THIS GAME REACH IT'S FULL POTENTIAL AND SEE WHAT IT CAN REALLY DO WHEN THE DEVS OPEN HER UP!!!! God bless you all and have a great day!!!P.S. will update review when I have played over 200 hours just to let y'all know I still love it!!!",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

In my experience the best chance of survival is being unnoticed as long as possible and only shoot when necessary. It runs fine on my rig but i also experience noticeable framedrops sometimes. There is still a lot of room for improvement (graphics animations map variety weapons melee system) but imho it's a really tense experience everytime.But be prepared that it might run on your system.Also unplug your controller or you will get a serious heart attack when you get shot the first time.

2018-06-16,0,0,108,False,Not Recommended,I love this game it feels satisfying but runs like crap some issues in the game are still left unsolved since it was launched such as bad servers and poor optimization. Even the mobile version of PUBG runs better than this.Balancing is a joke as well. Frag grenades are already fairly strong and no one was complaining about it. They buffed the hell out of it. Also they buffed SMGs and you can kill people at long range instantly without having worried about the recoil ARs become almost useless as they also nerfed the damage of this category at the same time.It's also worth mentioning that these devs are unbelievably lazy. Instead of improving its anti cheat system they region locked all players on the Chinese server alienating the player base and treat the Asian server as a quarantine. They also spend more resources sueing other companies who released BR games too prioritisation at its best.

2017-04-18,0,0,536,False,Recommended,Updated for 1.0 Game has come a long way and I have been playing it the whole while. The game is now released and even more important than that anti cheat has been added. The game has become better optimized since 1.0 bugs are still rampant and frustrating but I still can't seem to stop playing. With addition to the game like Death Cam and kill replays the game itself becomes a little more transparent. Have you ever died and claimed someone was a hacker but none of your friends believed you? Well worry no more now you can review your death from the point of view of the culprit and back up that claim... or find out you really do just suck like your friends suspect and exit out of the review in shame. Driving has become better motorcycles are not as much of a death machine as they used to be. The guns all feel good and each one seems to fit a different playstyle except the AKM always take death over the AKM.The dopamine hits in this game still make it a very enjoyable experience that has gotten better by the continued support of the now millionaire developers.Early Access Review Game has many bugs isn't optimized can be completely frustrating and is one of the best games I have played in 2017. So far the developers have been very transparent about their games shortcomings and how they will be fixing them in the coming months. If bugs frustrate you dont get this game yet. If balance changes frustrate you dont get this game yet. But it doesnt matter if you wait till its released or buy it right now you wont regret it.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

It's a complicated relationship.The long standing reality is that this game has a problem with cheaters. And for all the trumpeting about how much better it is I still reliably have messed up experiences. My last game I was shot two seperate times through windows that didn't break instantly downed on both occassions by an Mini14 (1 of which was to the body) before being attacked by the same squad who moved past me within five feet without making any noise. I have decent surround sound headphones and keep the volume high. They were wearing boots. It's a mechanical impossibility.Invisible parachuters. People loading weapons without ammo. Pistol snipers with impossible aim. The chap I blasted with an SKS once to the body once to the dome (And the kill cam showed the helmet getting toasted) who took 3 points of damage. This game is FRUSTRATING as a competitve environment because it's often straight up t.But it's a well populated shooter. And for it's flaws it's not Call of Duty with it's intolerable gamerbro combat aim steadiness preparation can really help in PUBG. Everyone starts on even footing every time. Teamwork happens and matters. There's real positives.I just wish I could see past them and put this how to rest. Because for every round I enjoy there's another that makes me wonder why I like to abuse myself.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-21,0,0,5,True,Recommended,Even in Early access this is a great game that is well refined and well worth the purchase if you are into Battle Royale games. The game is all about survival and finding the best gear you can to defend yourself. All while staying within the ever dwindling play area. Tons of different weapons and combinations so you are sure to find something to suit your play style. All in all this is a great game that plays increadibly smooth. It really is hard to believe that this is an Early Access title. With all that being said this game is not for me. I hate constantly being rushed by the decreasing play area. I always seem to land as far away as possible from the area that will become the play area. As soon as I make it to the area it starts the countdown to the next restriction. So I start heading that way and again barely make it. If there was a mode of play that took the restricting area away I would love this game. Always spawning and having to find gear is fun. I love everything about the game except for the dwindling play area. All said and done if you enjoy Battle Royale games with a play area that is always dwindling then you will love PUBG.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Once in a blue moon you will get enthrilling firefights mostly you would just die before actually seeing the players that shot you.On the other hand you could just camp and wait for the circle to close up but I enjoyed the collecting aspect more than actual battles considering its battle royale thats not really a good thing.Cheaters.All in all i have this uninstalled now unlike (free) H1Z1 which I do actually enjoy.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-04,0,0,1258,False,Recommended,IF YOU ARE CLOSE TO YOU $$$$ AS YOU SHOULD JUST WAIT AND SEE BEFORE CONSIDERING BUYING Games cannot exceed 30 min max because the circle that defines the gameplay area ends up being too small too avoid direct confrontation. Would you choose to play alone or in team of different format any minute could be filled with intensity that will blow up your hearbeat. PUBG has a lot of attention to details and as much tacit knowledge to accumulate that you'll get earning experience in this deceivingly simple game in appearance. You will have to learn to hold on your killing pulsion to stay alive. You constantly have to intellectually scan your environment and assess the situation before taking a shot if you happen to be in a predator position. Often you will surprise yourself being in a state of accute awareness when in fact nobody is around and you'd better be because death might be in the house next door running in this forest or laid down in that field of wheat. You cannot rely on your aiming ability alone to win a game unless mayyyybe if you are that 1/10000000's population MLG godlike pro player à la Shroud or Drdisrespect. I love that hunter/hunted feeling and the sound treats it extremely well the rain the reloads the crawler in ghillie suit hiding in a bush 1 meter away from you about to bash your head with an iron cast pan (used to make the best sauces and reductions I know what I am talking about here I am french don't mess with cooking) the plane passing by dropping military loot that lures the brave fools willing to go out in the open to get that unique sweet loot etc.Your suppressor or flashhider will make the difference if you are lucky enough to find one. No weapon does best in every situation a shotgun or an smg will own ARs in extreme CQC for the mobitly they provide ARs dominate mid range snipers for long range...Like me you will probably tend loot literally to your death as this maniac behavior will make you forget that your ennemies are not your feet (yet?). There are plenty of dilemmas in regards to equiping keeping on the side or discarding the loot. Looting is fully comprehensive of the learning experience just as positionning movement and all kind of intuitive timings. Most pieces of equipment and most guns have their very specific and objective value to which you will little by little as your earn experience add your own preferences of gameplay.(yes I am a VSS fan being that invisible mosquitoe is too much fun). This is this perfect balance between your own gear preferences and your actual needs that makes the looting system excellent one of the best I have ever encountered in decades of gaming experience. Driving vehicules is also surprisingly enjoyable.You get it I love this game it's the best at what it does a non hardcore realistic battle royale the perfect alternative to the ARMA franchise however I totally recon its difficulties to get to decent post release standards and Steam negative review bottom line even if extrapolated is justified. There's a reason why this game got so successful that fast. Now the only reason I do not recommend this game is because more realistic BRs games are coming out soon and we can expect them to provide a smoother experience than PUBG.

Not great.I also had connection peoblems so am asking for a refund.Seems like a good game but needs a bit of work. I'd probably buy it if the devs could sort out proper 21 9 support (when Vega is finally released anyway!),PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-05-28,0,0,722,True,Recommended,This game is extremely fun and exhilarating. With the playstyle foundation based on Battle Royal fending for your life on a huge island against 100 other players leads to hastened looting and intense firefights. Unlike other battle royal games you have customizeable weapons where you can swap out sights/scopes and add silencers to guns creating a varied gameplay. You can roll solo duo or in a squad of 3 or 4 friends. Buy this game.Your girlfriend will feel neglected and remind you this isnt real life. Still that chicken dinner tastes so good.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

It's fun to play with a group and have a lot of silly moments. The random spawn of weapons keeps things interesting and prevents certian areas always being the place to be. The choice/randomness of spawning also helps. At the end of the day it's a mix of hunger games and a cage match that eventually forces someone to be the top survivor.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

It's a completely different game with friends. Coordinating with a squad of people that you know is fun and shooting the as your group runs from place to place on the map between gunfights is always a good time.It's also worth noting that my best matches have been ones where I've been playing with a few friends and discussing completely different topics with no actual stakes in the game.

2018-01-22,0,0,298,False,Not Recommended,"EDIT The game has now also banned me for no reason. I've never cheated in my life. Their response to me is that there's nothing they can do. Be careful if you're using your lifelong steam account your account might get falsely game ban tagged by running their game. Mine did alongside this account.I will tell you something about the most successful game ever made also known as ""bug"". I think the servers are like below 1 tick. You will die behind walls you might die just driving a car around you might die due to unknown reasons you might die due to lag you might die due to desync and you will die due to bad ing care for this project. What the have they created...I have been shot with a shotgun aimed in the air after I was 5 meters away from the only door he could shoot me from and that's just the beginning.It's a horrible non functioning piece of crap. When it lags desyncs bugs or a combination of all written before it's the worst piece of ing you've ever played and you will feel like you've wasted countless of hours on eating raw bull testicles. When it works it's an exhilarating experience.You will shoot at a player and blood will fly across the fields like there's no tomorrow but he's still going and alright. There's no ing damage in this game at all. Weapons feel like they're BB guns. If someone says this game is realistic he's gone beyond the rational world. This game is the opposite of realism. Yeah they've done some bullet physics but so ing what? There's Arma and they've done it way better. I don't like the way Bohemia Interactive does their work but that's the only comparison we have after all this game is copied from Arma 2 &amp 3 except it's been dumbed down. I don't have binoculars to take a look around I can't take a weapon scope and look around with it I can't mount my weapon on a window I can't shoot through wood (except a door and a particular shed) I can't detonate whole buildings where enemies are lying foliage draw distance is optimum at minimum (makes foliage a hinder more than graphics) shooting at players deal jack damage... well there's a lot of things you can't do that you feel as an Arma player you should be able to. I want to add here there is no bodily harm if you've been hit besides damage taken. You will not bleed your hands will not start shaking if you've been hit in the arm your legs will not get broken you will not get concussions your friends cannot be taken to a coma etc. It's an arcade version of Arma. If you've come from Arma do not expect Arma. It's nothing like it. More like a child's version of the ballistics and every game feels like they're over 200 ping. I boycotted this project for ages and I thought well not many games get out of steam early access so I guess I'll give it a try once it's launched 1.0. Guess what? It's in a worse mess than it's ever been says a couple people who've played it for a long time. I knew it all along this was a money scam t project with no future.I have played games for 23 years including multiplayer games with bullet physics and I have never seen such a buggy ing mess. I love this game and I hate it at the same time only due to how it's been made. I have no words to describe this pile of If you like it It's an acquired taste for rotten diarrhea really.Just makes me off that the game's idea is great but how they proceed to care about their project is ing embarrassing.

2018-06-01,0,0,321,False,Recommended,I've had this game since way before the full release. I really loved this game at first and played nothing but this in my freetime for weeks straight. I stopped playing regularly about February of 2018 due to being burned out. It really is nothing against the game as I still have played on occasion. I also do appreciate the developers attempting to update the game with the help of the community to make it a game that we all want to play. As a battleroyal game this one is the best but battleroyal games are surrounded by luck. It got old really fast when I would drop somewhere and not get a weapon but the other team that was with me did. It really ruined the experience. To anyone who is interested in playing a battleroyal game this one is the one you should try but it comes with a harsh learning curve a lot of practice and you need a lot of patience to excel.

2017-04-17,0,0,138,True,Recommended,It is similar enough to H1Z1 but plays so much better. If you enjoy tacticle movement and teamwork (in duo's and squads) then this game will suit you so much better than the arcade feel of H1. This game is fantastic when it comes to team work. You have to cordinate and be aggressive in some instances and really passive in others. That balance is what makes each encounter feel so fresh and you wont be saying the game got me killed you will be saying I got outplayed. Which in turn makes for a game with much more depth than H1. Are there some bugs sure but nothing that breaks the game from my experience so far. I played H1Z1 when it first came out and was fantastic as the game evolved it become less fun for me. This game however after putting 10 hours on my first day after install left me feeling like I made good plays and bad ones but never felt like I died because of random ness. Fantastic pick up I was skeptical at first after watching hours of Summit play this my friend convinced me to try. So glad I did.

They nail the sense of urgency amount and balance of loot (for the most part) and full on clenched b hole panic. 100 player queue takes about 2 seconds.

2017-10-04,0,0,169,False,Recommended,"welp... good game but few problems(last edit was feb 14)PROS1.great concept the loot shoot and skoot idea is good and promotes action and tesion2.nice size map you can some what play the way you want with the weapons u want3.vehicles a nice touch for u to run away from the blue zone and be mobile4.recentley optimized the game alot more than it used to be5.added a new map finally6.ya this is dumb but vaulting is now a thing so ya good additionnow then to the CONS1.optimation is ok and or sub par even after this recent patch. i have a gtx1050ti 8gb of ram intel i5 4460 qaud core (3.2ghz) and tend to have to run this game at lowest to get 70 89fps or medium and get 20 35fps (note i can run fallout 4 almost at max and still get 60fps) and the game dose'nt really look any better with higher settings on the old map.the new map dose look much betterand runs alot better also. AND BOY OH BOY the crahses are pretty bad and tend to happen every time i play the game.....2.one gripe about controles is you can't toggle firt person ads to a hold bind in game.You have to go to a ini file wich is kinda ""odd"" 3.the servers holy smokes.the lag and dissconects are bad. i have had games with great gear and im ready to go and lag and end up ouside the blue zone and die becuase i cant even play or move. now this has gotten better but with xbox sharing servers it will be cancer for a few dayswhile xbox is stil hip and cool. hopefully some time they will get more servers up and running.4.the devs as some one who programs i can say you plan your project with optimzation from the ground up. making something then optimizing it can be a really bad experience.and dude they have sold loads of copies and are getting ready to release on xbox? BRUH the xbox can't even get 30fps at this stage cause your team cant figure out how to optimize there game.thats why the xbox team had so many problems. they had to find all ur bad code.5.THE STREAMERS. ok so i have not had this happen to me but people left and right are getting banned for killing streamers like wow kys.if u dont want people finding were you are ad a delay to your stream (which there is some delay already) or block out the radar.dont blame people for killing just cause u died in a wierd way.also go get some proof. if the have hacks orare watching ur stream dont just ban people.get a review system in place and see if its true. so all in all it IS a good game but the problems seem to keep coming up. micro transactions were on there list and they did that pretty fast so why is every thing else so hard. the new map is late and vaulting is also late but i feel they have really done some good with this game and the recent 1.0 patch so gotta say for 30 bucks i think the price is in a good sweet spot any less is a must buy any more and not worth it but i would be ready for the train wreck u wil face when buying this game and the extreme amount of problems you will face so be ready to either love or hate this game.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The game has great potential but looting for 10 minutes to get shot through a building isn't my idea of a fun game.Won't be playing again till I see people posting positive things about it.You have enough money now PU buy your own servers and stop letting people blame Google or Amazon for your server issues!!!OG review Despite the sever issues I still think it's an amazing game. Granted I don't get to go online as much as others because of having 3 kids and all that jazz but it's still amazing when I do get ot play.

It's as if this game does not want me to win any gun fights what so ever. My settings get put at the very low pre set I only get 40 frames and when I either try to shoot someone or they shoot me my frames drop to below 10 before I can react. Listen here this is what I run GPU GeForce GTX 770. CPU AMD FX 8350 Eight Core Processor. They rushed the ever living out of this game I know for a fact my computer should be able to handle 60 frames on very low settings. But no the very last thing the devs put on their list is optimazation when it should have been the first and makes it nearly unplayable for me and my friends who all have basically decent gaming computers.

2017-10-30,0,0,227,True,Recommended,PUBG is an alright game. I feel it is getting hate for adding micro transcations in early access as well as the mass amount of people being banned because of stream sniping. In my opinion I find this game so reptitive it would just feel really fresh when they update the game and add more maps. For optimization of PUBG it has gotten much better. When I started playing in July I was barely pushing 30+ fps with a GTX 1080 it was 2k on Ultra but still the optimization at that point was utter garbage. Now I can get 70+ fps so I'm impressed that they optimized it a bit better but it could still be optimized more. I don't believe this game should be getting so much hate in my opinion this game does exactly what's it's meant to do. Be a fun game to play with a squad of friends even now though we find the game rage inducing but in the beginning we had a ton of fun with it. The last game my squad played we played against a hacker which I have never encountered before in my entire time playing the game. He had an aimbot mod but it is just sad to see that their servers are now being targeted more to be hacked into. That modder stole the chicken dinner away from my squad as well it's just sad. Still like I said earlier I had a lot of fun on this game and have a lot of good memories playing it but it does need to be improved upon. Some of the funniest moments I've had in this game is when their is someone in your building you're terrified not knowing what to do run through the rooms of the house searching for a weapon. You end up finding best weapon in the game the pan. You find the guy lurking about your building beat him mercessisly with the pan teabag him then leave. Even these fun moments are fleeding though this doesn't happen often but I don't hate this game. When I come back to the game to play more is when they release new maps because for now to me it is starting to feel really stale. This review is based off my opinion.My final score for this game is a 6.8/10,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-02-28,0,0,5,False,Not Recommended,It's not a finished game. No aspect of it feels polished and some aspects feel broken despite being out of Early Access. I regularly have to kill the game because it hangs while joining a match. The shooting feels inconsistent at best. It is a resource hog when it has no right to be. Simply it is a poorly developed game.While this is much more subjective I also do not find this game the least bit enjoyable. Regardless of your skill level the majortiy of the time you spend in this game will not be spent shooting at anyone. It will be spent waiting for a game walking swapping gear and oberving your teammates that remain alive after you. If you die during your first encounter you've spent anywhere from 5 minutes to maybe upwards of 20 minutes waiting and performing mundane activities for literal seconds of excitement. If you're lucky or a higher level player this ratio improves and pehaps the game is more enjoyable.Extending that topic further for a game that seems to be largely about inventory management the inventory management is terrible. If a significant portion of your time in a game is going to be spent looking at gear comparing it and swapping it while simulatenously trying not to die those tasks should be damned simple and fast. They are neither. Unless perhaps you've memorized everything and developed muscle memory for the necessary interactions. Once again if you're an experienced player maybe this part of the game becomes enjoyable. But there's no good reason it should be that way. It's just poor design.Anyway this game is popular for a reason and if you've seen it and it looks fun you'll probably have fun despite the bugs. If you haven't seen it or if you're otherwise unsure if you'll like it keep a close eye on that gameplay timer. It's easy to lose track of when you spend most of your time not actually doing anything.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-04-23,0,0,19,True,Recommended,This game is awesome fun. As it is currently on Early Access it is not without its flaws such as textures not loading correctly random glitches lag objects going through one another such as grass into the floor of a house ect and what seems to be poor optimisation at the moment. However this game is so promising that the current flaws (which i have no doubt will be sorted as the game progresses) dont stop it being really enjoyable.As the trailers show it is built on the Battle Royale formula of everyone being thrown into a combat area to scavenge what they can to kill each other until only 1 remains who wins. The game setting is full of areas to explore wide open areas to worry about crossing red zones that have bombs dropped on them that move periodically and a combat area that continually decreases in size to force the combat.The game combines stealth action excitement and suspense all into one and for such a simple formula it could provide endless hours of entertainment and is certainly difficult to be the last man standing.On top of solo play it also has co op and group play which adds a cool alternative game mode and i am sure once the game is out of early access that additional maps and potentially different game modes will be added.All in all this is a decent game as it stands now and looks like one of the early access games that could be a great success. I certainly know i made a good choice in picking it up and cant wait to see how it develops!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-04-14,0,0,208,True,Recommended,This game is okay but it gets pretty annoying when you have to mash the F button 5 times just to pick something up. I know that this is a early access game but I still want to write a review in its current state. Some sounds that you hear are off so it gets kinda hard to pinpoint where the enemy is. There is hardly a variety of guns and in the end you usually end up with a common rifle AK Scar M416 or an M16. Melee weapons are near next to useless just becuase guns are scattered all over the place. If you intend to play with friends then go ahead and buy the game. It really is fun playing with friends.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-07,0,0,257,True,Recommended,Battlegrounds is a multiplayer powerhouse. The highest played non valve game on twitch ever. It is a blast to play with some mates or as a solo experience. It is in early acsess which intails there will be bugs. So if you want a perfectly polished game go play somthing else. Even with the occasional glitches it is an absoulute great time playing this game. It takes a while to get good but once you are getting 1 4 kills a game its just pure fun. I would definitly playing a ton of this game with some friends. But do a bit of reaserch first. for example tips and tricks videos or learning all the controles. It is incredibly more advanced then its other Battle Royal counter parts. Almost definitly the best multiplayer experince this year. I would rate it 5 AWM's out 5 as a multiplayer expeirience.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-08-07,0,0,9,True,Not Recommended,Yeah it's early access. Yes it has it's problems. But it's really hard to enjoy right now. The rubber banding was intense. The way they handle player bans is archaic and 100% word of mouth. Even if you're recording and provide evidence that you were wrongfully banned they mostly just give you a middle finger and tell you to deal with it.This has so much potential but not everyone's going to enjoy it right now.

2017-08-07,0,0,42,True,Recommended,This game is awesome. From the moment you parachute out of a plane its a race to get geared up get a gun and clear the area. You can play it slow or balls to the wall. I was a little anxious when I first started so I played it very slow but as I got tired of losing at the end with one kill I sped up my playstyle and actually got more kills by doing it. This is one of those games you play with friends with headsets to get the full experience. That being said you can go solo and have a great time but its more fun with friends. It has a dayZ vibe without the zombies and less walking. Sure there are bugs but its still in alpha. The microtransactions was kind of greedy but meh its not like you'll get an advantage by forking over cash.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Even the main menu is clunky and unresponsive at times.

It really is a shame that you make us gamers pay 30 euros for a game that lags and lacks a decent optimization PUBG is out of early acces. Devs you need to prioritize when it comes to this game. The recent event made me cringe and you know why. You now want your costumers pay more for your allready bad game in form of crates event pass and other ridicolous things. I will be kind enogh to give you a list of what to prioritize. This list might make us happy again! Increase your communication with the playerbase. We will be more satisfied if we know what you are up to. (Overwatch) Optimize the game. Fix this and you can compete. Deal with cheaters. Nobody likes cheaters. Optimize servers. Fix this and you can grow the playerbase. Make a better BP system. Look at R6... No crates. Remove pay to open crates. Your game (price) does already scam us. Give us more content new weapons skins and cosmetics. Bluehole I hope you listen and start prioeitize I really love this game. I don't want to see it die I don't want it to become a scam.

2017-07-18,0,0,1426,True,Recommended,After many hours of jumping dying jumping dying I can still say I love this game. The new patches have given the game a smoother feel and fixed alot of the bug issues (even though there are stilll some) but overall the feeling of being one of the top 10 remaining and reaching for that win is worth it. I have never had a game hook me in as much as PUBG. It can get frustrating at times but the amount of fun I have had with it makes me forget about the bad. I will say if you are a person with rage issues it may not be for you. This game is alot like gambling. You get your cards and hope for the best but skill is also brought into play when it comes to fire fights especially when you can actually hear footsteps and where gunshots are coming from. Its all about knowing when to be patient and when to go in for the kill. With PUBG still being in early stages its incredible the amount of fun i've gotten out of the gameplay. Best Early Access I have ever played hands down and can't wait to see what the future holds for this game. I randomly purchased off of the top sellers list and have been in love with it ever since.As far as bugs at this point it's mostly network lag and some freezing issues but it has came far from what it once was.If anything I would give it a try and if it's not your style simply refund but personally I recommend it to all my friends.9/10 (Once it is fully optimized I have a feeling it's gonna be a 10/10 for me.

So I got 3 cars and blocked the bridge after the zone getting smaller the guy had to cross. After about 5 minutes he eventually comes around and drives up on the sidewalk. I was spent a good amount of time on that road block. Hunted the guy down after a good 10 minutes same guy. I had no gun prior to this because of ing around making this road block. After finding this guy im shouting telling him he needs to respect me I ram my car into his he gets out and starts to shoot me. After running around the car and so many fail attempts to kill me he runs out of ammo. My good old friend the frying pan did the job knocked the guy out and got to tourture him with my great singing. 10/10 game. Highly reccomend you to get the game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-04-09,0,0,476,True,Recommended,This is the most addicting and endorphin pumping game that I have played in a long time.There are issues. It is early access. The developer is transparent and appears to be working hard on the game at all times. The performance and optimization patch coming up will tell a lot but this game is legit.Plus... MODS WILL BE COMING. A mod friendly stable platform for all kinds of shooter madness. It's only going to get better from here.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-04-09,0,0,135,True,Recommended,Great game. Feels like what a lot of the DayZ clones should have done right. With the way DayZ and H1Z1 is... this is probably close to what THEY should have been.

2017-04-09,0,0,75,True,Recommended,After some playing I meet a group of people that im currently playing with and we are having a blast compared to the toxic community on H1Z1 ive only meet a few asshats.Pros Better loot and drops over the map u dont need to look for hours to find what u need.Reward system feels rewarding as in points and no loot crate and keys money grabs skill determine what you get even the good stuff.Little or no game bugs ive found one so far and its the killer car that if u hit another car kills them all look it up.Frying pans! the ding sound they make is just epic.GFX and controlls are 100% better then any game ive played in genre.Wide range of guns and attachments easy on the go equip for more awsomeness.Cons Points can feel horrible hard to earn in squad Que and i would hope they could make a better reward system for squad play that for me is the main reason to play a game like this. even doh the reward is crap in squad I still play for giggles.Windows in buildings are always shady and hard to see threw meaning u have to bust it to make sure u get a clear shot giving ur position away.Squad members have complained about the Rain on some matches causing them alot of lag and until optimized i would suggest you could opt wheater out for these people(never had a issue myself).All in all if your looking for a real battle royal game this is the game its well worth the 30 asking price you get alot of polish for your money and alot of fun if u like the game.9/10! and a frying pan!Ideas Would actully like a survival game in this aswell with base building and stuff just because.Would love to see wildlife and maybe some infected to make the game even more hectic.See u in game ),PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-19,0,0,224,True,Recommended,When I first got this game I was honestly a bit skeptical. It didn't run well at all and was buggy as hell. But these issues weren't what had me nervous (It was and still is early release of course it wasn't fully optimized yet).No my main concern was that it would be stuck this way like so many early release games before it. Fortunately this never happened.I am very impressed with how the developers have been on top of player concerns and am very releaved that the game now runs quite well. With the weekly and monthly patches the developers have ironed out many issues with the game and have even added new content.Of course the game still has its flaws (Afterall it still is in early access) however it's miles ahead of where it was a couple of months ago.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

There are three ways to play this game. solo where you are pitted against other people pllaying the game on their lonesomeduo essentially the same as solo exept with one matesquad round up your 4 besties (or 3 randoms) and blow people up until your herts content .If you are looking for an alternative to H1 or the like you should definitley give this bad boy a go.

2017-10-26,0,0,2340,True,Not Recommended,This game started out as something revolutionary to gaming. With a leaderboard system that would actually be worthy of watching it would have become the game of games. Unfortunately it has been ruined by cheaters who just want their 5 seconds of glory. If you buy the game expect to just play it for the fun of it. Their ranking/leaderboard system is 100% broken now as the top 300 players (on all servers) is just flooded with cheaters. Its too bad too. If they had actually cared enough to protect their community from this stuff I doubt there would be a single game on the planet anyone else would be playing.

The concept is cool yet the circle can really be a sometimes. The current downer for me on this game is how many asians play on the NA servers. The only worse thing than having a teammate without a mic is one that constantly talks in a different language. For all the asians out there that know English and can communicate you're the real MVPs.*edit* Played with an asian he used google translate to tell me an area was empty. I thought thats nice of him... turned out to be another duo waiting there who smoked me soon as i got close to him. They preceded to play as a 3 man team in duos. I was less than pleased and preceded to give them some gangnam style over the speakers the rest of the round.

Overall the game is good in concept and is in the vein of The Culling or H1Z1 KOTK. I bought it after watching some streamers seemingly enjoying it and I am excited to see how this hold up. Right now I've had to tweak the settings to ""stay competitive"" meaning that settings are cranked down and grass is minimal so now I know what I assume everyone else is seeing. The devs have a road map of improvements and a time table of when they will be reworking certain parts of the game. I've been burned by Early Access in the past (looking at you Toxikk) but the game state right now is much further than what I'd expect from Early Access and I'm happy with the purchse I've made. Remember that staying hidden and camping is a viable strategy.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-03-29,0,0,202,True,Recommended,Mechanic wise this game is far superior to H1Z1. A big plus is the lack of bunny hopping and zipping around as you have stamina and you turn slower. At the moment however the game is still severely in Alpha and needs serious work. I've heard they're working on optimizing it though. Which it needs.

There are Netwrok issues since bluehole rents their servers and they are complete garbage with fluctuating server tick throughout the match that affects hit detection still playable. The reason after 8 months of gameplay i finally uninstalled this game is because of the cheaters and the microtransactions. Cheating is extremely prevalent Bluehole claims to be working on it but their game code is written so that most essential items register client side there are no checks in place no way of the server knowing if you actually scored that headshot with a shotgun from a mile away but the client said you did so alrighty then. I dont expect this game to ever be fixed reason being for every one of Blueholes ""ban waves"" the only thing they are succeding in are selling as many new copies as they banned. Its just more income for them to make it look like they are trying to stop it while doing it to make extreme profits. as long as they give the cheaters time to make their money back from the initial purchase theyll keep buying new copies to keep doing it. Now they have gone and thrown a paid loot crate in with the rest on a random roll. I refuse to pay money to buy a key for a chancce at a cosmetic item I already have 10+ of.

Sometimes as a player encounters another player in close quarters some lag could present its self giving the illusion of a hacked kill but was rare. A death cam replay is offered when you die so you can see how your opponent killed you. By watching the replay you can determine if they glitched hacked killing you. at that point you have the option to report them.

2018-03-17,0,0,643,False,Not Recommended,"ONE MAJOR FLAW BLUE ZONE! This game is broken messed up freezes crashes lags has tons of cheaters and generally is what you would consider a pretty poorly made game... and I still enjoy the hell out of it. It has that ""IT"" factor to it and the gun mechanics are really good. It's best with a group of friends some alcohol and no life on a Friday night. As mentioned above though... The zone system is by far the worst part of this game. Dying outside of the ""play zone"" or getting caught out in the open because someone else guessed where to drop better than you removes the skill aspect of the game. The system if it doesn't change its very basic nature needs some critical additions. ONE audible tones to warm of zone movement (i.e. 1 minute 30 second and 10 second beeps to warn you that the zone is about to move). When the game gets down to its final players STOP moving the zone let skill be the deciding facor not forced movements or a deadly zone (example I just finished second in a game because I was in a gun fight with someone and thought I was inside of the zone. Because he hit me a few times my health was low and I didn't realize that I was 6 inches from the zone and not actually in. He won because I died outside the zone ONLY SIX INCHES FROM IT he was hurt badly too as we were in a great gun fight with each other). YES... there will be campers... but there already are. Those players are always found and usually killed. Rarely will the final ""X"" (X a set number of remaining players 10 5 2 etc.) just crawl through the grass for more than a few minutes before someone gets antsy and goes hunting. For those rare occasions when guys just snake around they'll be tied up in one game and not spawning into another to ruin the gameplay. Ideally the zone system is replaced with a system that only kills you if you are sitting idle outside the zone. If you are moving towards the zone then you should either NOT take damage OR only take the smallest amount of damage.

2018-01-03,0,0,136,False,Not Recommended,"The game itself carries a beautiful concept which prvoides you with a unique gameplay experience of battle royale a mode where you struggle to survive in a ruthless fight with 99 other players. I'd give 10/10 for the idea but PUBG doesn't really meet the needs of players. I won't say anything about optimization that's a well known issue of this game so if you don't have a superb beast of a machine don't even try it ( NB last patches improved the situation a bit ).First 10 15 hours feels like something incredible. Your heartrate increases palms sweaty knees weak arms heavy... you know that feeling don't you? The game makes you taste adrenaline tremble in horror when you encounter a possible enemy in a local villiage and feel jubilant after securing top1. But having played around 50 hours in total ( Part of it on my friend's PC ) You're becoming sick and tired of all that repetitive gameplay. Yes it felt great in the beginning but as soon as you have learnt the gameplay patter it becomes dull and pathetic. Basically any match you play comes down to 2 things getting a good rifle some medications at least lvl2 armor and helmet and THEN just moving to the innercircle area and trying to secure a good spot for yourself. This is probably the only game ever that tells you ""Hesitate. Don't take the risk. Sit here and watch them kill each other"". I've taken top5 around 7 8 times without even killing other players just by hidding and waiting for a good moment. Is this game competitive? I don't think so. ANOTHER PROBLEM is that looting system in my opinion doesn't really make the player go for it check every building loot villages and towns. As mentioned before you simply don't need much stuff and the amount of loot which spawns literally everywhere is just INSANE. Usually you easily get a M16 or M4 with several upgrades so you don't give a damn about other weapons ( who needs shotguns and pistols?). As the fight almost always happen in a wideopen area you only need an automatic rifle and you just get rid of your UMPs MicroUzi pistols and stuff... There's a very limited pool of weapons mostly because of the spawning chances. THIS LEADS to another conclusion you're not really that intrested in killling people if you want to secure a top10 or higher. The game doesn't reward the player for being the fastest hand in the West. You're not intrested in the loot other players have because 90% of things you had already gathered yourself long before you met an enemy thus it is almost always better to avoid fighting because you'll only risk yourself or reveal your hidden position. Yeah sure when you're in top12 15 you're forced to battle with other players but again it comes down to your initial position you obtained earlier.THE SHOOTING in the game is great though. It requires a lot of skill and practice which really makes the game way better than any other games in this genre. So what do we have? We have a CS GO in an open world where instead of buying weapons you have to find them yourself and then meet the foes far away in the middle of nowhere. You're great at shooting and got the best loot possible? Good there'll always be somebody who is happy to shoot you in the back or meddle in a fight when you're not checking the other angle. Don't get me wrong it is fun in a certain way even a worse player can win. The problem with PUBG is that it doesn't reward risky play much. The only thing which gives you an advantage is a paradrop with AWP/another good gun but this is the only thing currently present in game. Whether you land in a big city or a small villiage the chances you'll get everything you need are almost even. Above all there's no point if fighting until you reach top 20 because you won't get anything but another round of bullets you will not use anyway ( Seriously who the hell needs 200 ammo for M4 ? ). and maybe some bandages to the 500 you already have. That's what it feels like when you're playing solo. What I'd like to see from the devs is implementing more rare loot and rebalancing this system.How about adding more top loot places faraway from the centre of the map or making another map with like a megapolis architecture which will force players into close combat areas? What if players could bleed and you couldn't stop that with painkillers or energy drinks ( Same goes to breaking legs/arms losing sight and etc... ). In other aspects the game is great But I still have to give it a negative mark mostly for the optimization issues and that repetitive playstyle.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I get some people are going to revert to the ""git gud"" argument and thats fair but at the very least HEADSHOTS with any caliber should kill you almost instantly. 2 shot kill at max if you're wearing helmets not 3 or 4. There's nothing more infuriating as placing your shot at the upper torso and letting the recoil guide you to his face like most fps shooters only to realize those last two shots that landed square on his forehead only removed his helmet. Literally this game is amazing and aside from normal gaming hiccups such as lag hackers and performance drops (which have been greatly improved i might add) I have no fault with this game.Fix the damage system and i'll be satisfied.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-08-03,0,0,1132,True,Not Recommended,With every Patch the games is just getting worse have almost 1k hours in it. Netcode sucks they not doing about those hackers reported several of themwith undeniable videoproof and i see one of those is playing again. Keep theplayer numbers stable i guess. No real content the BR theme alone is justgetting boring as the most people figured out how to stay alive till the end andits basically RNG with the zones if your lucky you just simply dominate. Hit registration became really unpredictable. But i guess its all about microtransaction from now on so we can enjoy those highgrade design there putting on top of those weapons (orange eyecancer wtf).,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2018-03-31,0,0,160,False,Recommended,I sorta like playing and it has the ability to keep me coming back but I cant count the amount of times I land and find nothing but junk laying everywhere. Ill find a micro uzi stock in 5 houses in a row. Ill find pants hats flashbangs and ammo until my 5th 6th house which is a very common scenerio and finally get an M16. And when u do find guns oplenty its shotguns and pistols. Do they work? yes are they effective? if you can survive long enough to empty your 45 into them or have time between pumps of the shotgun yes. Now finally when I have a game where I find the scar or M4 75% of the time I find my self the farthest possible distance away from the circle which means I have to take one of pubg's loud and dreadful vehicals which I absolutly hate for the fact you can hear them from a mile away and no matter how defensive and evasive i drive 50% of the time Pvt. Jackson is there to snipe me in the face. You will find your self being assassinated by Seal Team 6 frequently too they just pop up on your and take you down . The game requires both skill but more so then anything else... Luck. so the last thing I should mention is you spend about 15 to 20 min in game and get maybe 20 seconds of action. Thats if you didnt croak early which is common pending on a variety of scenarios which alot of are not in your control.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-04-09,0,0,404,False,Recommended,"Product received for free. Wait i haven't written a review on PUBG ?Well better late than never.Alright where do i begin... General First off it's a pretty nice game. Concept is really good and the map size alongside with the balistics physics and weapon customizations. Not super complex but not a point 'n' click adventure. The 2 1 map Erangel has a really good setting with multiple tiers of loot progression (before you say "" t"" read over to the Loot and Spawns part.) Community Community is more or less ""Meh"".Not a case of Counter Russians Offended but it's no safe haven either.In the starting phase when you're waiting for the game to start while players gather you'll be having your ordinary mic spam. Kids with ear piercing voices multiple languages being spoken (if you're in EU) some music or people with a silly gimmick such as 1 of my encounters a guy asking if i wanted some "" "". Sometimes you might get a very salty individual to scream insults at you upon his death sometimes in some ancient long gone language which is a nice sprinkle of commedy in my opinion. Gunplay Gunplay is nice. It's raw and feels responsive when you get used to it. Snipers feel extremely satisfying the longer the distance is. Every single weapon has an attachment available to it whether you're putting a Bullet Belt on your WWII shotgun or finally finding that elusive compensator for your AKM you have it all. And in case you're trying to snipe that 1 guy 500m away from you don't worry there's a zeroing system to help you with that just open the map get the rough distance between you and the target zero your scope in at the proper distance and take the shot. As i mentioned above in the General tab there's actual balistics in this game meaning that you have both Bullet Travel Time and Bullet Drop as well as degredation in the bullet's speed and damage over distance and the recoil mechanic is really in depth with a lot of stats put into it. You can check This site pubg.gamepedia.com for all the details on weapons statistics from damage to velocity and damage per distance traveled. Shotguns are just charming. Of course with a drop of sarcasm. A big drop. Movement Movement i'd say is 6/10. It gets the job done but it does feel kind of stiff though it's FAR better than Arma 2 on which the Battle Royale game genre originally ran on. You can Walk Sprint Run Crouch run lay prone. Basic stuff for a mil sim like game. The 1 thing that puts it above those mil sim games is the Vaulting and Climbing mechanics which works flawlessly 9/10 times. It's dynamic meaning that whatever you need to vault over you will vault over. Same goes for climbing. Vehicles Vehicles... I'll just say that the only vehicle that handles somewhat well is the Buggy. The Uaz is stiff and definitely not a good choice if you decide to drive away from flat surfaces. The Dacia (or as a friend calls it ""Grandpa's car"") is fast but boy is it furious. The thing slides about on any terrain mud grass rock and even handles like a sled on asphalt. The Bike is a nice option if you know how to handle this raging bull. Most of the time you'll land on your rear tire but instead of going back on both of its wheels you'll be catapulted into a front flip and prossibly die from the event. The Bike with a basket is not an option unless you're desperate. It has really unrealistic handling steering is just as bad and if you try to use that thing off road... God bless your soul. Hippie Van is nothing special it's a goddamn Volkswagen Van what would you expect. The Pickup ... Made specifically for the map you rarely get matched on which is mostly off road. Here's the thing It's definitely not good for off road Boats and Jetski are your only options if you want to sail across the PUBG seas. Nothing to say here does what it needs to. Loot and Spawns ""This is where the fun begins..."" Anakin Skywalker Probably the biggest problem in this game.Not gonna do any ""BUTS"" and ""WHAT IFs"" here. The loot spawns on both Erangel and Miramar are not very encouraging to the player. Most hotspots and ""high risk/high loot"" locations aren't all that they would seem to be. Loot spawns in those hotspots are really spread out and unbalanced. You'll be dropping on the Military Base on Erangel only to kiss your shotgun goodbye before you get mowed down by someone who found an M416 right next to you. Most of the spawns are clothing which is pointless it doesn't give you any advantage doesn't give more storage capacity (with the exceptions of the Belt which isn't even something you find on the map you just have it by default and the backpacks) Only clothing that gives you an advantage is the Ghillie Suit which is found in airdrops. Loot is HEAVILY RNG based meaning that sometimes you'll find a single flash in a big building or find 2 first aid kits laying around in the toilets. (Check my screenshots it's an actual thing) It's not really common to have reasonable gear unless you kill 2 3 people in Solos or 1 2 teams in Squads/Duos. Looting extensively wouldn't reward you for your efforts as you think it will. They've made some changes to the loot spawns in 2 relatively small patches which is nice but i'm still trying to find an UMP when i drop on Pecado Arena. They're going to release a new Jungle map sometime this year and from what i saw they're actually learning. In fact i think they put a little too much loot on the hotspots luring people out in the same spot and leaving the rest of the map unpopulated with 30 40 people alive Mid Game each time meaning that the games feel sluggish and slow. Maybe even boring. BUT it's a step forward since those people that died in the Early Game had an equal chance of defending themselves unlike in the current maps. Game Performance and Bugs It was FAR worse before PUBG came out of Early Access. Building weren't loading in even on high end systems optimization was leaving people with 1080s struggling to keep over 60 fps at 1080p and people with decent PCs were experiencing a stuttery 40 fps at most trainwreck.It can be better definitely but at least buildings are loading in unless your HDD is slow and/or Fragmented to hell and beyond. My PC specs are just about the recommended 8Gb of RAM i5 4460 and a GTX 1050 2Gb VRam and it runs fine. 60 to 80 fps on 1080p but when i'm moving around the map it starts to stutter and lag spike because it needs to load in buildings props and god knows whatever else.Bugs are... well not a rarity in this game. Sometimes the servers decide to totally themselves and decide that this 1 bullet needs to hit you after you've went to cover. But the same goes the otherway around! There's shots that don't register sometimes. Shots that visibly hit people. There's this occurrence when you shoot somebody he kills you but your bullet is flying towards him. Since you're dead the game says ""He's dead he can't shoot anyone"" and decides that your precious bullet lethal or else is just a harmless BB. Vehicle bugs such as hitting invisible stuff or not letting you out of a flipped bike are present and were present for quite some time. There's this rare but just awfully irritating bugs i've been experiencing where the game sometimes forces you out of ADS. It hasn't happened a lot in my play time and it's a pretty recent bug as well so it's not all that critical. CONLUSION A really good game.But a really trash one at the same time.It's a bitter sweet experience. It's addicting and you can enjoy it regardless of the bugs and issues but it hits hard when those bugs and issues take place in your game. 7/10 from me.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-10-08,0,0,112,True,Recommended,PUBG is a great and genre defining third person Battle Royale. There is a unison agreement on what's good with the game yet it has its flaws mainly when it comes to optimization and controllers. As a shooter enthusiast one quickly discovers that the controllers feel unprecise. Yet the game's main contribution to the gaming scene probably is the concept and tension built in its battles. Nothing compares to the adrenaline this game imposes and I expect this to be a recipe which will only be improved upon in the coming years.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-10-05,0,0,626,False,Recommended,Update as of 1.0 Release (12/23/2017) The game now runs better than ever and have had little to no hackers. It is my favorite game and my game of the year. I now highly recommend it to everyone. Performance is perfect on my i7 3770k and GTX 1080 it rarely drops below 60 with all settings on high. Killcam and replay make it easy to see if you were killed by a cheater or just got outplayed (git gud) and the report button also works now and reports are being processed so cheaters are dropping like flies. 10/10 Would recommend the game now.I enjoy this game it has been my most played game in months. However I cannot recommend the game in its current state. It was getting better for a while but it feels like any progress has been flushed down the drain. As of the most recent patch my game has been crashing when loading into the main menu a lot. Also as of late the amount of hackers has really put a bad taste in my mouth. I would recommend this game if they actually optimize it so I am not dropping frames on a GTX 1080 and if they also make the report button do anything. Reporting hackers and team killers with the report button does nothing.EDIT (11/24/2017) As of the latest Test server builds all the issues seem to have been fixed including hackers. Here's to hoping it makes it to full release in this shape.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The fanbase for this game is already massive and thats because even though it has alot of glitches it is still a fun game I just hope PlayerUnknown fixes these issues before the games starts to lose players.

2017-12-30,0,0,786,False,Recommended,I have a love hate relationship with this game. Too many rounds I spend ten minutes looting before I get a decent loadout then die to somebody I never see. Then occasionally I have a round where my kit comes together to give a good weapon with optics which allows me to be competitive but the circle is on the other edge of the map and I spend the round running just to die when I get there to somebody I never see. Then the third type of round comes everything I do turns to gold. Weapons and armor are plentiful other players dont get the drop on me and I make it to the end of the round and get kills. That third round is transcendant fun and it hooks me hard. In summary this game should be played with friends in your squad and has some of the most awesome gameplay ever when you can find gear to be competitive and dont instantly die to somebody getting the drop on you.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I was nearly done with this game before that point anyway having played since the closed beta phase and only seeing the game spiral downward with each update. I went ahead and bought this new copy just to keep tabs on the game (No more removing miramar map) and it only continues to dissapoint. A couple of updates ago they put out a patch and the game all of a sudden ran amazing again like the early beta stages of the game (Yes there was a time) but that lasted mearly 3 weeks and after two more patches it is now running at an all time low. Almost my whole crew now uts more hours into Ironsight a free to play fps game that resembles call of duty modern warfare 2.

2017-04-05,0,0,703,True,Recommended,Playerunknow's Battlegrounds is a fun and fast paced 3rd person shooter that pits player vs. player in a Hunger Games style battle royal. This game is similar to H1Z1 but seems more polished. It is currently in Early Access and is working out some bugs. Besides some of the issues that plague any project under development this games runs pretty well. As a gamer that loves survival I love this premise. I enjoy the shoot outs and running away from the invisible killer EMP. I have a lot of fun with this game. If you are looking for a finished product I suggest waiting until the game is officially released. If you don't mind a few bugs filling out some surveys and being apart of the development process this might be a fun buy. Hopefully it wont's stay in Early Access limbo. FUN or RUN! Fun Great shoot outs hunger games style 1vs.95 battle open world cool guns survival elements &amp sky diving.Run Early Access can be laggy at times under development if you exit a car while driving it runs you over &amp some players are jerks.Watch some of my best kills so far in my Blow the Man Down game play music video with the link below.

2018-03-30,0,0,463,False,Not Recommended,I can't recommend this game at the moment. There have been some good updates but in general the updates come to slow and we're forced to play the horrible Desert map. Maybe some of you might like it but I don't and after getting the map several times in a row I just can't stand to keep playing. Even when I get my favorite map I can't really enjoy it as much because if I die too fast by doing something fun like dropping into school or military base then i'll risk getting the desert map 8 times in a row again.It's a fun game that's how it is so popular but the performance still isn't great and the aiming in the game just feels so rough. It's not a smooth experience and if you aren't an amazing aimer then this magnifies the problem. When I play other games the aiming and tracking feels so natural but not this game.Honestly though I could forgive the rough performance and bugs if they just let us pick our own map. I still like the game a lot and at it's core it's fun. It's just not fun when we get that horrible desert map. I clocked so much time on this game and after the new map came out I can barely force myself to get online. Even when my friends call me to get on I find myself just telling them to play without me.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-12,0,0,781,True,Not Recommended,This Is The Greatest Running Simulator on Steam Highly Addictive!Great wide open spaces lush forests running rivers... all the lovely scenery that you can ask for in your not so leisurely jog across the island.This game provides a fantastic entrance for your high energy jaunt through the island of Erangel. You and about 99 other marathon fanatics get to choose where on the island you want to start plummeting to the Earth at 234km/h or popping your chute early to enjoy a birds eye view of the quaint towns and verdant farmlands.When you hit the ground the game will spawn a white circle as far from you as the island allows. You will also get about 5 minutes to lace up your shoes and stretch out a bit. After 5 minutes the Blue Circle of Death starts closing in on the island. You don't want to fall behind the blue line or you get Achilles Tendinitis and you slowly start to die just like in real life. I love realism in my games.You may try looking in to some of the abandoned buildings for some gatorade but you will only find painkillers and Red Bull. The energy drinks may be high in sugar or perhaps you have an allergic reaction to ibuprofin... but on this island taking lots of pill makes you run faster! So grab them when you can. Avoid putting on armor though unless you just want some added weight for stamina training. The armor doesnt actually protect you from anything as you will still find yourself being one shot by a pistol from across that sparkling lake you were appreciating. Always pick up the gas masks though these are totally awesome for altitude training BRO!As you run down the roads dirt paths or just taking it off the trail you may run into fellow athletes who try to attack you. These are just some newbie joggers who didnt stretch enough and know they wont make it to the white circle with the killer cramps they have. Just run away from them because they will eventually die out in the wilderness anyways. Or you can take your chance with an actual gunfight but I dont think this game was designed for that.You may try to take a cheat day and just drive to the white circle but thats something else this game wasn't designed for. Driving in this game is similiar to running in QWOP. You will frequently find your vehicle flipping itself into a violent deathspin for no apparent reason. Never get out of a moving vehicle either as it will hunt you down and run you over out of spite. You need to bring the vehicle to a full stop and turn off the engine if you plan on finishing the race.Anyways keep running to stay in the white circle. Eventually everyone else will succumb to their shin splints and you'll be awarded with a chicken dinner.p.s. If you find yourself in a building with a weapon never try to shoot out of the window at another athlete. You will severely damage the windowsills and probably off the person you were trying to shoot at outside.Kid tested. Masochist approved.Seriously though Inconsistent damage inconsistent movement inconsistent gameplay. The loot and spawns are supposed to be RNG not the very core of the game. Terribly optimized with top of the line video cards SSD drives processor memory this game still has trouble hitting 60fps at medium settings.

Many parts of the game arent clipped properly and your bullets dont hit. It feels like crap whether its the servers or the netcode or what I dunno. Ive never played a game thats so massive and so popular and has so many problems even smaller games that havent sold well are more polished better than this.Ive got a few clips ive saved of people killing me when they arent where im shooting. For example a player at a window I shoot at him through the glass and I die watch the replay and hes out through a door on to a balcony. You are shooting at shadows in this game its so terrible. This game is only gonna make fortnite more popular.People are knocked out lying on the ground and you shoot them point blank with a shotgun and they dont die lol.

I would and have been recommending this game to others.To tackle a couple of issues some people are having Yes there's glitches and other bugs but it's Early Access. If you have a problem let them know. I don't understand when someone (I know not everyone) downvotes an Early Access game when they run into their first glitch. (Might just be my luck that I haven't run into many glitches)I'll admit going back on a promise is bad but it's not game changing. It's cosmetic items not starting off with an unfair advantage. Completely forgivable if this extra money means improvements new content and general progress which I want to believe it will. Personally I won't be buying any in game items but that's not because I disagree with it.I'm having great fun with this game and looking forward to see what's next for PUBG,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-03-27,0,0,560,False,Not Recommended,I won't go into the bugs and completely random loot distribution because it's just tip of the icebergTo not be completely negative I want to say that the game has the most awesome and unique shooting mechanics I have ever seen in an online FPS. It feels amazingly rewarding to shoot opponents in this game and win gun fights.Unfortunately with each update the optimization gets worse.It has become unplayable on EU servers because of server instability and packet loss.NA servers are somewhat playable. They have the same problems but feel more stable Another problem is the game movement doesn't feel smooth. It feels weird unintuitive and inconsistent.It also feels as if every action in the game other than shooting has an input delay which is incredibly frustrating.1 5 months ago I simply quit playing the game because I was getting too frustrated with all the above issues (and more) and recently I wanted to check if anything changed for the better.It didn't. If anything it got worse.I'm writing this review because I believe this game has huge potential but it's unfortunately on a downward spiral because of sloppy development.It feels like the game was designed by a team full of people with passion for these kind of games but is being maintained by completely different team who doesn't really care about anything but getting a pay check.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-04-03,0,0,1587,True,Recommended,This game is fun and surprisingly addictive. Athough it can be slow and frustrating at times it is very satifying to hunt and kill your enemies one by one.There are a few bugs and graphical hiccups but for the most part it performs well enough.A few towns seem to slow the frame rate even on lower settings hopefully performance will be optimized in the near future.I would reccomend this game. I cant stop playing it.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-04-03,0,0,442,True,Recommended,Don't really write reviews but here goes.The game has a lot of upsides so I'll start with the downsides.First off the optimization isn't there. I'm not saying it's bad I'm saying that it's unoptimized. Sacriel put it very well in a stream of his saying the game is badly optimized is a bad way of putting it. The game has not YET been optimized at all the devastated have focused on gameplay and creating a working game first and now their top priority is optimization. This means that soon enough you will be able to play this game on less than an i7 1080 monster rig with stable frames.Next off the glitches. Things like the ridiculous vehicle flips occasional invisible players silent shots ed up sounds and the likes. All this is due to the game being early access of course but if you look at games that were this glitchy to begin with like dayz no matter how much they patch bugs at this point new ones will just pop up imo and it will always be kinda buggy.Also server issues. I'm half decent at this game and often make top 10. The amount of times the server dies at vital moments or even no vital is ridiculous. I was once able to use the lag to run into a building and shoot a guy 20 times without him even seeing me because on his side I probably wasn't even in his area yet. (Yeah I'm a scumbag for using lag but at least I can see it as a problem)Also some minor game mechanics like the time you have to get to the circle can be a little ridiculous as sometimes you will take damage from the circle even if you begin running as soon as the next circle pops up due to the distance it often spawns from you and the 2 minute timeframe it gives you.Now the positives.Gunplay is great up there with Arma and DayZ it has some of the most intense and heart pounding battles a game can give.Looting is very easy and the inventory system seems pretty refined. Compared to games like DayZ Arma H1Z1 and the likes which often have very clunky inventory systems it is very easy to use the PUB inventory. REALISM you can't jump out of a car full speed and live! Which is awesome.... however jumping out of a boat full speed kills you... which is a little ridiculous (but I assume just a bug as they have the boats a similar code to cars)The map isn't crazy huge so it's not that much of a running simCar and boat chases are crazy fun and intenseThis game really has too many positives to list. The community is pretty great and I've really enjoyed the time I've played.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2018-05-26,0,0,38,False,Recommended,the game is fun and thrilling but the system requirement is so high only player with high end pc can play it.. i wish the dev make the game to be more light so that player with low end pc can play it too..,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2018-07-20,0,0,315,False,Not Recommended,First of all I wanna say that I really like this game. It looks good it feels good to play BUT there are simply too many hackers getting away with freely wallhacking and auto aiming to the point where they are comfortable enough to just make it so obvious that they are hacking that they KNOW they won't get banned. I've played this game way before they even had Miramar (We won't talk about Miramar being an absolute shambles of a map) and there was hacking back then BUT the hackers would get banned when they did it so they kind of just slowly diminished. Until 1.0 where they update the game with a bunch of new maps and systems which is really cool BUT they also updated their NEW ANTI HACK SYSTEM that allows players to get away with hacking sounds a little backwards right? Well that's how it is.I would be more than happy to recommend it to others with a thumbs up but this issue with the hackers makes the game completely unplayable and very frustrating... I will only recommend this game to others ONLY after the developers decide to fix this hacker epidemic issue instead of going down the money grabbing route. I get that companies need to make money but it'll be a bit hard to make money when you neglect your fans so much that they're forced to stop playing because of the people that like to ruin the fun get away with it because of and bad security/Anti hack systems.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-04-26,0,0,663,False,Not Recommended,"It was fun while it lasted.I've been playing this game off and on since April 2017 when it become available for Early Access. Up until Version 1.0 this game had promise. Then it got swamped with cheaters. And microtransactions. And no updates that resolve the fundamental issues with the game the laggy netcode terrain clipping and overall clunkiness of the movement and physics engine. And cheaters are still prevalent. They're not subtle cheats either search Youtube for ""Shroud PUBG flying car"" and you'll see what can happen due to abysmal server side data validation.In Australia good luck finding a match on a map you like. An update towards the start of 2018 broke the matchmaking and the player base plummeted from there.After 650 hours I can't force myself to play this game any longer.

2017-12-27,0,0,1059,False,Recommended,If i have to start with an honest opinion One of the best games i have ever played in my life.. To start with a bit of feeling and mechanics The game is quite realistic as in modeling physics laws animations etc.. Terrain Textures Lighting and Modeling are quite satisfying and with the additional optimization changes after 1.0 it runs quite well on a variety of pc specs.. About gameplay and progression it doesnt require you to grind anything to play the game so you can just play for an hour or two and do something else.. if you can that is ) Considering the amount of games that require grinding nowadays be it achievements or unlocking certain elements to progress this is a perfect game for those who does not have too much time but wanna enjoy a really cool game. It might feel a bit strange at start to learn things (if you havent played this genre before) but you get past that period quite quick so even the most casual player can enjoy it in no time. There are alot of game modes for your pref. so i believe it will be easy to find several ways to play the game even if you dont have any friends. Also as a last note the game still has some problems (which i think there is no such game without bugs or glitches.. even those from big companies) which are very few compared to early access and its developers are (even when they started as a very small team) listening the community and they fixed majority of the problems as they promised and people seem to be quite happy about it so far. I mean there will always be people that will complain about the most insignificant things and they are impossible to please (and i will be honest even i complained in the past from time to time but from what i have seen so far they did a great job to fix alot of things) but overall i find this game to have an incredible potential and the genre proved itself to be quite fun for both casual and competitive manner.. So these were my experiences and opinions about the game (considering it being my first battle royale game) and i hope it helps those who are not sure about.. ),PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-05,0,0,56,False,Not Recommended,"I no longer feel I can recommend this game in it's current state. Despite now having been out of early access for several months the game is still plagued with tons of issues including server lag poor optimization inconsistent hit detection and tons of other bugs and glitches. What is the point of leaving early access if your game still plays like a beta test? And yet they continue selling it as if it's a finished product. On top of that the game has been plagued with hackers and cheaters as of late and the developers are remarkably quiet on the issue I guess hoping that it'll go away on its own somehow? I so badly want this game to be good it has such huge potential but I feel like it's getting wasted away as the game slowly loses more and more players to other games in the BR genre. If they want to keep this game in the spotlight they're gonna have to start putting some serious effort in the coming months or it's going to go the way many other similar projects end up.Original review for archival purposes Despite its technical flaws which are expected for an early access title this game destroys the recent trend of multiplayer survival games. It has found the perfect spot between survival and tactical shooter something other Battle Royale games like it before have failed to do in my opinion. The game still leaves something to be desired in terms of lag and performance however I feel these issues will be padded out over the coming months as the game pushes towards a full release. The dev team shows a lot of promise. Many of these games end up in something I like to call ""early access limbo"". Right now I don't believe that will be an issue with this game.Also to comment on the recent controversey involving a new microtransaction system. I don't see it as an issue at all. In fact I think it's a good thing. The crates being sold for real money contain items that are purely cosmetic. You are in no way at any disadvantage if you don't want to buy these crates. Meanwhile the extra income from these microtransactions gets put back into the game making it even better than before hopefully able to be supported for years to come. I'm aware people are upset that it was originally said that their would be no microtransactions in early access however you have to understand that this was said well before the game blew up to become now one of the most played games on steam. Plans are expected to change in these situations.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-09-16,0,0,765,True,Recommended,"This game is a very unique experience and one I very much enjoy. And the developers are by far some of the most attentive and willing to please I've seen backing any game I especially love the little details added like the graffiti furniture lights even the lightswitches sounds like the newly added bandage tape tearing dropping the can after drinking an energy drink and turning over when you're doing something while prone plus the idle motions wonderful and well noticed little details that enrich the experience. for gameplay. I'd give this a 9.9/10. There are very few problems with the game really but the ones that are there are still an issue. First off the rewards system was ok in the earlier stages of it being in early access now it's gotten a little broken. To be blunt it's just overthought. The points are spread throughout a team when you're playing duos or squad when they could have simply made it a standard ""you got this place you get this amount of points for it"" and have that decrease the more players there are. The hitpoints system is overdone as well it should just be a set amount per kill maybe a bonus of 10 or 20 for headshot kills. Simple to the point (pun intended) and fair. The last game I played was a squads with 3 people we got 5th place and I got 2 kills. 74 points. This kind of thing is what has made getting anything above the 700 crate a chore. And the reloading is a bit messy at times. Like you'll reload in a critical situation you'll hear the click of the first round supposed to be going in the chamber but then you start firing and there's nothing in the mag for 2 seconds and those 2 seconds matter at times. And this is less common of an issue but again in a critical moment can throw your game away. Holding the ads in third person puts you in a sorta ""zoomed hipfire"" which is a lovely and very useful tool but you can switch which shoulder you're looking from to peek around different corners again great system but with that occasionally comes a glitch where it will switch shoulders without any reasoning to it and throw your aim completely. And my final problem is with the ""zoomed hipfire"" again when you're backed up against a wall in close quarters combat accuracy is still important and in a pinch you'll go to use the zoom for more accuracy faster but because you're against the wall the third person presses the player model basically in front of everything making you blind to 80% of the space in front of you. If it forced a first person view then there would be no problem. Those are my few real complaints with the game overall I still love this game and play it adamantly it's amazingly fun with friends or going solo and I highly recomend this to anyone who likes a fun competative experience. All that being said what I and I think others would like to see implimented in the game would be firstly making the wooden/plastic/whatever bars that stay after you shoot out a window either destructable or at least penatrable that 3 milimeter thick piece of adamantium has saved countless of my enemies and screwed me quite thuroughly. If you're in the passanger seat of a car or the sidecar of the moterbike that has it you should be able to use healing supplies Drivers seat or the back seat of the bike would be the obvious and understandable exceptions. You should also be able to move at least at walking pace while using them as well. If sprinting cancelled the action I'd understand but you can walk and wrap your arm with a bandage or drink a soda at the same time. The last thing and this is just something that wouldn't change the gameplay at all but would add just a bit more to it having the option to spectate and see how a game ends from your opponents view after all your teammates have died of cource have it an option to spectate the rest of the game and see what happens. That is my input on the game as a player who is pretty addicted to it and enjoys it as is",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-04-01,0,0,13,True,Recommended,TLDR It's unoriginal but fun. Runs like trash but in apha. If you don't have above average hardware don't waste your money. Tried this game to see if it would work on my mid range machine. If you've ever played BattleRoyal in Arma 3 then you've played this.I do enjoy the engine as it has a good balance of complexity and usability. But I have to give 0 credit for creativity. This is somone who made a mod in Arma 3 and got really into it. So now they are trying to rewrite the Bohemia engine so they can make some money from the game. This aside the game feels good and plays well mechanically from my brief passing by. I'll still pay for it once it is optimized. I have an i5 4660 6Gb of RAM and a GTX 950 HDD. Not a great machine by any standards but I can play similar games with much higher performance. It feels like and issue fetching the game models. Any time you turn your view or when you are jumping from the plane it takes so long for the game to call the lower to higher poly model that I get sub 1fps. Not sure if that's exactly the correct explination for what's happening but that is what it feels like. Anyways I've refunded this game until a time that it is optimized or maybe I will but it in 3 years when it's on sale and I have a new PC. I'll be recommending it because it will be fun if you can run it on your PC.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-06-17,0,0,503,False,Recommended,"This game has a lot more bad than good but for some reason it is still fun.If you are playing to win a chicken dinner then you'll never have fun because you're playing to win. You're against 99 players when solo 50 others duos or 24 other squads. You have to play for the hell of it not for the win. You get better by not hiding in a corner because when comes down to being the last ones you most likely will lose because you don't know how your gun works.The good about this game is that the audio cues are really good so playing surround sound is your literal savior. The gun play is crazy good in my opinion. The bullet having drop drag and travel time. The vaulting is alright wouldn't say it's bad but it could be a lot better. As well as each game is unique since no situation is the same.The bad is still the rubber banding and desync when there is a large amount of people in one place. The glitching of through of hitboxes for certain terrain and buildings when vaulting being not able to climb up certain rocks using vaulting even though there is a clear ledge you can grab on. Vehicles getting phased through walls and blowing up.Overall this so called ""fully"" released game has more problems now than it did in early access. Not saying it isn't fun but if you want a clean game this isn't really the game for you.

2018-04-04,0,0,57,False,Recommended,"Good game very fun but has some flaws. As with many games this is not perfect but I have found to enjoy it a lot. This is especially fun when playing with friends as a team or God forbid strangers. It seems like the developers have not been putting a lot of effort lately since there is no absolute changes to the game only more useless content. Now I love the idea of having a progression in a game and this game certainly needs one. What I mean by ""useless content"" is that we are not receiving any useful stuff for the game. Instead of fixing bugs and what happens to some bad internet connectivity and lag they are adding more skins and loot crates which I am not very inspired to obtain. The game devs should really focus on fixing the flaws in this awesome game and later add the content we could have fun with. Overall it is a flawed but awesome game that has innovated with a new formula and never gets old of playing.Oh also PUBG&gt Fortnite",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2018-04-04,0,0,200,False,Recommended,"I know there are a ton of negative reviews but don't let them turn you off to this game.This game is a paradox. It's controls are wonky. There are bugs aplenty. It's graphically . . . outdated (but not by much). It's frustrating 99% of the time. Hackers use to plague this game pretty hardcore (though I have noticed a significant drop in the hackers recently). But here is the most important quality I keep coming back. I've played games that were significantly more polished. I've played games where the gunplay was significantly more satisfying. I've played games where I was significantly more skilled. But this is the game I continually come back to month after month. Why? *Shrug* It just has that ""it"" quality. Winning is hard so very satisfying. Almost winning is easy enough to make the whiff of victory strong in virtually every match. 30 minutes per match (if you make it to the final circle) seems to find a sweet spot between too quick to be satisfying and too tedius to keep coming back to. If you like a ""realistic"" battle royale format get this game. I promise you'll find flaws but you'll also more than get your money back in entertainment value.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-03-27,0,0,422,True,Recommended,This is an early access game so expect some performance issues and glitches as well as some server issues every once in a while. The developers reputation leads me to believe that his top priority will be taking care of these issues instead of adding more pointless content like most early access games without actually fixing the core game. But honestly you just need to understand the game is in early development and that you need to turn the settings down pretty low to get a decent performance out of the game. The game itself is VERY ADDICTING! When you first start out it can be frustrating because everyone keeps killing you but once you get used to the aiming mechanics you will have a hard time putting this one down. The fire fights in this game will nearly give you a heart attack they can be very unpredictable because of the way the map is layed out and the amount of weapons and attatchments you can find. This game doesn't feel like h1z1 where it seems like you waste 95% of your time running toward the designated zone or just waiting the way the map is designed and the ability to choose where you jump into the map will consistently get you into confrontations keeping the game exciting throughout. I watched this game in beta of other peoples gameplay and i was not impressed but i gave it a chance and im glad i did. This game is a gem among the early access games that are out now if you have a decent PC and can run this game in its current unoptimized state theres no reason why you shouldnt buy it if your'e skeptical buy it try it for an hour or two then refund it. But im confident after an hour of playing this game you won't even think about refunding it. Overall? BUY THIS,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

However I have been craving a game that really sparks my urge to play games again. I have about ten hours into it and I can already tell what is GREAT about this game and what is BAD about this game.PROS Simple but fun formula Lots of variety in gameplay even though there is only one map. Plenty of attachments Fairly accurate weapons (as in true to real life) Open map with plenty of nooks and crannies Decent community (always saying racist and sexist things pre game but once the game starts people generally try to work as a team) Decent weapon balanceCONS I can't tell if there is something wrong with the hit boxes or if the server is just a tad slow (not reason enough for me to stop playing) There is no manteling system in the game. (example can't jump/vault over most fences and or wall)CONCLUSION I love this game. I hope the devs continue to improve upon the game and add more maps as time goes by.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The real way to fix this game is region lock but Playerunknown (Brendan Greene) has gone on record saying that a region lock would be xenophobic.

2017-04-25,0,0,773,False,Not Recommended,I am changing my review that was a very high endorsement of the game and the developer. I bought this game from the developers website early on. I was one of those guys who had the bandana shoes jacket and pants that sold for over $1500. I have been playing the game constantly for several months and my friends and I have had a blast playing together in squads....Until.....The cheating. Oh....my....God....the cheating. Don't get me wrong. I know that there are cheaters in every game and you will run into them every once in a while. No worries. happens. But this game when I am writing this (Jan 4) is absolutely a pile of crap. The past two days I have played 20 rounds and without a doubt a minimum of 15 of those rounds we were killed by chinese hackers. I am not just saying because I died it was a cheater...I reviewed EVERY death with death cam and also replay. Replay is the best because I can actually follow the player for quite a long time priot to my death to futher confirm anything sketchy.I am not exaggerating. At least 75% of our squads games on the NA server end with a death from a chinese hacker.Don't buy this game at this time until they get the chinese confined to their region. As long as they can que in North America I consider this game unplayable. 20 minutes looting and fighting legitimate players ending with multiple laser beam headshots to your level 3 helmet and insta death to your squad is pretty frustrating. Great game otherwise...one of my favorite I bought in the past couple of years. Ruined by cheaters....,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

You know this via the deathcam which you can view after you die it essentially gives you the POV of the opponent who killed you. Head lock on without aiming from 50 yards(or 500) away.

2017-03-23,0,0,101,True,Recommended,WAY BETTER THAN H1Z1 However there's still a few issues and I do recognize that this is in early access and you can look at their plans for future updates which is amazing but there are still a few worrisome issues. FIRST When you first drop into a server it seems like everyone is lagging. I'll take three or four punches from someone without even knowing it and can be killed before even picking up a box of ammunition because I can't properly see where my attacker is coming from. SECOND Punching does WAY too much damage. For example people will opt in to following you around as you loot in the beginning rather than going their own way to loot because they know they can kill you if you stop to pick anything up. The punch damage is disgustingly high. THIRD The game has no 3D sound. None. It is EXTREMELY difficult to tell where shots are coming from and I'm finding it hard to pick up on whether poeple are right outside my house or three houses down. The footsteps don't seem to be very stable it's hard to hear people reliably. That said the game is still an absolute blast if you can get past the first 5 or 6 minutes of a match to where it seems like everyone's ping levels out and the game truly begins.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-21,0,0,518,False,Recommended,Pros Solid Combat Doesn't treat you like a five year old (I personally feel like a moron playing Fornite) Good content value for price Consistent flow of new content Very quick matchmaking Fun with friendsCons Worst optimization of any game I have ever played Graphics are mediocre as a whole Hit detection sucks but is getting better Hackers are a serious and frequent issue (I have gotten second place two or three times because of a hacker) Completely random loot means that even the most skilled players lose way more than they win Loot doesn't spawn in immediately Driving is terrible Lots of down time.I am really conflicted with this game and what I should give it. Although the core gameplay is entertaining I just can't help feeling like this game is only good due to a lack of proper competition. Because of this I would recommend this game if you really want it but otherwise wait for another battle royale game that will inevitably release in the next 6 10 months that will blow this game out of the water.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-03-19,0,0,114,False,Recommended,"After 30 HoursThe Game is really hard to play. I only get 1 kill on most of my games. Even I a Gamer who loves Shooters FPS or TPS find it hard to somewhat improve in the game. Hope that they add a Firing Range of some sort so that everyone could practice spray controls and get the hang of the guns. Movement feels clunky well at least for me. I don't know why but I feel really slow. Sometimes it's laggy and delay can be felt even on the SEA Server (I'm from Philippines). Chinese players are flooding every match even on the NA server. I tried to play in the NA server hoping that I could actually play with people who can speak English but I still get matched up with Chinese people. I don't hate them it's just really hard to communicate with them. I really wish that they'd have their own server. Based on my experience so far I recommend this game. After 40 HoursI'm getting the hang of it. I'm watching a few PUBG streamers and I've been taking notes on how they play and I'm actually learning something. When you can actually kill people in this game and manage to survive for a bit long it's actually fun xD. Still need the Firing Range though. I also like the new Weapon skins though it's not really necessary. Or maybe it's just that I'm poor to afford them. I also like how you can sell the cases. It helped me save up for a game I really want to buy for long. I think that's it for the ""After 40 Hours"" update.

The new crate system blows but it's still an amazing game plus if you play FP you don't even see what you look like so you don't need the items. There are still plenty of bugs in the game however they are not common for me. I've played this game so many different ways that it should be fun for any kind of style you might like.

2017-10-13,0,0,237,False,Not Recommended,After playing this game for over 200+ hours i can say for the most part this game is garbage. The devs will not region lock so if you play with random people expect not to understand what the they are saying. they keep putting out crates you have to pay to unlock like WTF??? and their servers are constantly down so this multiplayer only game can rarely even get played. The only conclusion that i can come to is that the devs only care about generating money because they keep implementing in the game where you have to pay to unlock anything and they do nothing else. Hackers are also rampant in the game so more often than not you will get killed from weird angles and places you should'nt even be able to get killed at. so all in all if you want a game you can rarely play you like speaking to only chinese people you enjoy getting gunned down by people that arent even pointing their gun at you and you love pouring tons of time into unlocking only to have to pay to unlock said then this game is for you.

2018-04-01,0,0,303,False,Not Recommended,Personly i really liked the game when it first came out now there is lag issues the client still isn't fix they brought out a new map with out fixing all the issues from the first one and the new map is so badly constructed so i like to play the old one but there is no way of choosing which map you play on. I feel this is because the creaters / Developers knew that they spent so much time on it and it was a waste of time because 90% of people would rather play the first map. Then there comes the desync issues which make the game impossible to play on my screen im leaning out the door on my screen but on a enemy's screen im stood out in the open. faulting they said will fix the game and make it more noob friendly and only 75% of the time vaulting actually works and they removed crouch jumping so you can't do that in stead of vaulting. this is why personly i would never by an another copy of this game until the Creaters/Developers fix the minor issues.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

That problem would largely be solved by simply locking those degenerates into their own server where they can hack each other to death but apparently PUBG's devs are afraid of looking ""racist"" and hurting people's fee fees so they refuse to do it.On top of that despite the creation of new maps the game feels stagnant and development seems terribly slow for what pretty much amounts to a large scale arena shooter. The undue focus on churning out loot crates instead of actually fixing things suggests it's all going to end up just like H1Z1 a game which PUBG's lead creator had a hand in developing too.As it is now the game's only good for farming crates to sell on the market.

Not to mention for over 3 months there was a glitch that rendered the game unplayable if I moved my mouse to the right I couldnt shoot or aim or do anything with my mouse until I moved my mouse back to the left it made aiming and shooting impossible and if anyone was on my right side then I was sure to die.

2018-04-07,0,0,67,False,Recommended,PUBG offers two experiences which are both equally enjoyable. You can play seriously which offers a more tactical experience where you work with your teammates. The other way you can play is goofing off with friends and messing with the game's physics. I prefer to play with a mix of the two. Some of my favorite experiences playing video games with friends are in this game. That is where I believe this game really shines playing with friends. Single player rounds for me tend to get boring after a couple of rounds. But duos and especially squads can take several rounds to lose any of their enjoyability. However this game does have some big problems. The most famous of the problems is the bugs especially with the vehicles. The vehicle bugs are a blessing and a curse. Playing a non serious game and suddenly having your car launched is hilarious. But when you're trying to win and suddenly your bike is thrown into another dimension is frustrating. Most of these occur with the bikes most notably being the three wheeler. The three wheeler is cursed by Satan for having the worst stability ever. You can go over a slight hill going three miles per hours and the bike will do a quadruple flip. The game seems to decide when these bugs will kill you or not. You can slam into a couple and trees and maybe have to be revived but if you do a single slow flip and land wrongly you launch in the air crash into the moon and explode. They have been updating the game much more and changing things. For example most of the weapon sights no longer give you a severe migraine while you try to look through them. However there is still the problem of the mid game. The mid game feels very slow with not much going own. You may face the occasional fight but most of it is just walking towards the new zone. The beginning is fast and chaotic while the end game is intense but the mid game is just cold. Hopefully the new smaller map can get rid of the mid game and blueboys can finally release an update that doesn't break something else. Overall the game is a fun experience especially with friends but has many problems that are slowly being fixed.Also people don't post PUBG wins on Snapchat so that is a plus. 7/10,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-01-05,0,0,118,False,Recommended,"PUBG An Honest Review (For Justin).Hey I'm MiniM your gay super friend here. If you don't get cancer you'll find some cool information about PUBG in my review. Lets go!PUBG is a MOBA (Battle Royale for short) and places you on an island against the wits of your enemies. The objective of the game is to be the last man standing out of the 100 players (even though an average of 20 players leave as soon as the game starts). You can play this game alone or stratagize with up to 4 friends amd make some MLG outplays.The game starts with you on United Airlines going to either Sweden or Australia that is.... Before 100 plane tickets were bought and all 100 passengers were forced off the plane. Unfortunetly you were dropped off right before they started filming the hunger games and as soon as you dropped they told you the rules ""Kill or be killed.""So you start looting and looking for the best items in the game when... BAMYou were shot in the back of the head with someone hiding behind a door waiting with a shotgun...You laugh you lose.You join in a game again and find the legendary shotgun. You repeat in your mind ""If you can't beat them join them."" As you set up behind the front door. Someone comes! The zone is moving in and someone take refuge from the outside attacks in your house. Little did they know you were sitting there with your ultra strong lil pump action shotgun ready for this moment. You aim.... Aim... Aim... They stop moving.AND YOU HEADSHOT THAT RIGHT IN BETWEEN THE EYEBALLS!You did it! You finally killed someone in PUBG and as they're bleeding out on the floor waiting for their teammate you say ""You laugh... You LOSE""And shoot him one last time with your pistol and begin looting all the stuff he has. You leave the house because of the zone approaching and as soon as you walk out the door your only victim's teammate opens fire and you die.You might be thinking ""Hmm that sounds like a not fun experience and a ton of t""BUT IT'S NOT! It's the MLG pro status you get after gaining your first kill and the immense amount of pride you get after beating a 2v1 and the heart pounding exhillerating feeling getting that lucky headshot winning you your first ever chicken dinner that makes this game so fun. And I think after you realize that having the best graphics and having the highest rank in the game doesn't matter you'll be having tons of fun too!Thanks for reading my honest review.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Other games are fun or have better and more polished gameplay but nothing compares to the amount of enjoyment I get while playing this. Perhaps it will fade away as I play more but as of now it's pretty much my go to game. Yes it has a lot of flaws and is lacking polish but with the frequent updates the polish will come.

This game could definetely use some work *cough* optimization for the love of God please *cough*Pros Lots of different types of guns and weapon attachments aswell as gear The ability to choose where you want to land from a plane Gameplay is fun encountering other players is always excitingCons Game is not very well optimized I have a gtx 1080 and an i7 6850k and most of the time I am only getting about 40fps on ultra. The ""safe zone"" and the ""blue line that limits the playing area"" could be improved. They seem like they were implemented towards the end with not much effort put into it.

2018-03-16,0,0,21,False,Recommended,PUBG. This game brought light to a niche genre of battle royales. Pretty fun to play but it does have shortcomings. The community is terrible (even if hilarious to me). if you have bad RNG it is impossible to win. Despite this the game is a must have for any gamer. If you are a fortnite player pick this up. (In my opinion) It is a better game. It is a wonderful action shooter game and every battle can be your last. Many shooters don't have the pecision and skill needed but PUBG delivers. Many shooters have some aim assist that makes me feel like my hand is being held but in PUBG I rely on my skill alone.PROS A great shooting experience A fair challenge Fun to play overall Balanced guns (shotguns are a little sucky though) Good to play with friendsCONS Community is worse than CSGO ( If that is even possible) RNG can be a problem even if rarelySome could argue the RNG makes for a better experience but i personally don't like it.OVERALL SCORE 8/10,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-06-27,0,0,481,True,Recommended,After the last monthly patch (August) i have changed my review I changed my review from negative to positive this change is thanks to the Dev's hard work at constantly fixing and optimising the game it may take longer to fix some bugs than others but thats the whole purpose of EA.PUBG is now a fully playable game with minimal game breaking bugs if any at all. There are some bugs but these you won't notice i have to give major props to the Dev team for the good work. The cheating in this game has gone right down but the number of scriptors is rising. Scriptors various in different ways and it's highly unlikely you will come accross many at all. The inclusion of FPP was heavily needed with alot of the people in this game heavily relying on third persons issues there is still some issues with FPP such as no leaderboards (coming soon) and the issue with focus lock (holding right click) but this is a problem in TPP also). The ADS alternative in this game which is some sort of focus lock is extremely broken basically when aiming you get 2 options FPP ADS and the Focus lock i am on about the focus lock is highly innacurate and seems to get blocked by the smallest things (E.g. trying to shoot over a buggy is impossible as there are so many random invisible hitboxes that bullets can't seem to pass through best option is to go FFP but you can still have issues.)No doubt my issues i have had will get sorted soon so buy the game and win yourselves some chicken dinners!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

This is no esports cuz of the game's RNG mechanics and hilarious bugs so play CSGO or Rainbow Six Siege if you wish to go pro. If you want time pass look no further.

2018-01-03,0,0,120,False,Not Recommended,I wouldn't recommend this game at this state. Game ruined by cheaters from China. Bluehole's response is to lock and remove all posts about cheaters and then make a statement saying that limiting Chinanese players from playing on other servers is racist. In reality they're making millions off Chinanese players. Banned for cheating? Just buy a new game. That's their business model and it's working.Note I say Chinanese because they differ from oversea chinese (ie. Taiwanese Singaporean Malaysian and other oversea born Chinese).,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

My only drawback is that im running of a HDD however until this patch that wasnt an issue.!!!UPDATED!!!after playing the last two days all of my problems have been resolved and buildings even load before touch down even on an old HDD.

2017-08-15,0,0,86,True,Recommended,I have been a console gamer my entire life. Never really got into PC gaming. PUBG released and after watching countless hours of Twitch Streams I finally caved in and ordered a PC literally so I could finally start playing PUBG! It was well worth the purchase as I have put countless hours into the game in the short two weeks I've owned it. This game is by far one of the most intense games I have ever played. Making it into the top 10 on solo matches always gets the heart pumping. The squad matches are extremely fun when the entire team communicates and works together to progress in the match. I also get a lot of enjoyment out of the first person matches and actually prefer playing the squad first person matches over anything else. No real complaints for this game as it is very well put together and fluid for being offered at the 29.99 price point. The only things I could pick at would be the hit detection at times it seems like my shots are missing a guy literally 20 ft away from me with my reticle deal on with the target and sometimes the jumping can be frustrating getting caught on random objects. Looking forward to seeing where this game goes in the future and cant wait to see what new features will be added!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-07,0,0,74,True,Recommended,"Game's great microtransactions aren't great but they are completely cosmetic and the economy is broken causing items that would normally be &lt $0.10 to be nearly $30.Also don't let the majority of these people fool you whenever it comes to what these microtransactions actually are. There are 3 different types of crates at this moment 2 of which are free to obtain AND free to open. You earn all 3 of these types of crates by earning in game currency based on how you did in the ""battlegrounds."" Like I said 2 of these are free to open one of them requires a key. The key costs $2.50 and the items included in the crate consist of movie tie in items for Battle Royale. If you ask me the items you can recieve via the regular free crates are 100 times better than anything you could recieve in this paid crate not that my opinion really matters.The gameplay is fantastic and it is everything I could have ever wanted in a survival/arena shooter. If you like H1Z1 King of The Kill or The Culling this game is better than both of those.Technically speaking this game is hit or miss. Some of my friends can play this game perfectly without any stuttering while others with superior rigs can't even hit 15 FPS in some areas. This is expected of an Early Access game the dev team should be focused on adding new features to the game not optimizing it.

Don't get me wrong this game is very fun and addicting. The first few hours of gameplay gives you a rush and a sense of nervousness. After you get used it which doesn't take long it becomes stale. There is only one gamemode with two maps. You can't customize your character outside of a god aweful loot crate scam. As a stand alone fully released game it's not good. Not by a long shot. It feels like I got an add on rather than a full game. Don't get me wrong some people enjoy doing the same thing over and over but to be considered a ""full"" game you need to put work into it.

Come on man i wouldn't even pay 15$ for this. 10$ would be a fair price.Its GLITCHY as hell. Theres tons of glitches and unrealism in terms of the vehicles which are terribleYou get a ing heart attack every match because you get hit from somewhere you dont know and the objective is to survive PBtw the reason why its so ing boring is because its the same over and over againMatch die after 5 min(or even faster) repeat.And if you're lucky you'll be holding shift for 20 minutes just to get killed.I know this review is chaotic but i'm just really upset about this game... I wish i could refund it or get money back in some way...The market? Damn. Bluehole sure is making some cash off that INCLUDING valve. You get a 60 cent worth case that is not worth opening every 10 matches or so? I mean its awesome! BUT. Here's the catch of the 60 cent case you get rewarded You have to play this terrible game to get it for a whileOh and uhh the gameplay is ing horrible. I still don't get why this game isn't obsolete since the free to play announcement of Fortnite (Which is an even prettier more fun and overall better game).I would'nt even play this if it were f2p.CONCLUSION Don't buy it. Even though the misleading videos that make it look fun+streamers influence you on buying it.. You'll regret it after 10 20 hrs of playing like me,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

They focus on putting microtransactions in the game (Which Brendan Greene promised it wouldn't have) when they need to hurry up and push out the bug fixes and new maps.

You're sneaky you avoid any contact with any other players unless you're 100000% sure you can kill one guy running through the open field. You get yourself to last 10 your palms are sweaty knees weak arms are heavy vomit on your sweater already mom's lasagna. You let those guys kill themselves because you have no freakin' idea where they are. Then when there's only you and one other guy you get headshoted by some ghillie suit guy with AWM 1000 hours played and/or cheats if he's Chinese.Your 145 bpm heart rate drops to 0 scent of chicken dinner fades away.Then you play again.Because you want to be the last man standing.Because you want that freakin chicken.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Maybe im just the unluckiest man on earth but that doesnt seem right somethings wrong there the chances cant be THAT low. Also with the addition of ""pay to open"" crates whenever i get them they basically sit in my inventory forever or i sell them on the marketplace because i refuse to pay money for them (which i shouldnt have to because i bought the game for $30 already) so thats one less chance at an item every week. Its a small issue but a rather annoying one. Just let us buy a damn crate of our choosing with our BP greedy devs.As for an example of bugs my friends discovered TODAY after a ""patch"" that you can walk backwards through a wall in one of the most popular spots in the game at one of the apartments of El Pozo. Obviously they dont bug test enough because that one should be a no brainer. Not only do bugs make it a bad experience but the plethora of ""cheaters"" is absurd and the fact that the loot seems to be RNG based where you can land somewhere and have amazing amounts of ARs SRs meds armor and ammo for a full squad one game but get absolutely nothing in the same area the next and killed by a team with all that loot JUST because of the place you landed. It's ridiculous. Try using pistols to take down a team with level 3 helms vests and m416s its ""possible"" but not probable. Game has serious performance issues as well but im sure thats one of the most discussed issues with the game. Honestly they could remove probably the entire outer edges of the only two maps they have in the game make them smaller because no one ever goes to those locations anyways. Would probably help a little with performace but im no expert.Overall its a great idea a great design even (in some ways) and its really fun to play especially with friends but these large issues that may seem like small ones at first start to grow and grow on you and eventually it just ruins the fun entirely. I'll still play it because of the time ive invested but currently im not enjoying it as much as i used to so in its current state i cannot recommend the game mostly because i want the devs to wake up and fix these issues that have been discussed since the game launched from ""Early Access"".",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Single player is fun but the most frustrating of the game modes. Duo is significantly more fun but the game really shines when you find a group of four people to play together with.

2017-12-26,0,0,69,False,Recommended,All year long I was skeptical about purchasing the early access version of this game so I withheld. All year I would stumble upon Youtube videos about PUBG and once in a while check in on some streams of this game. I also play on Xbox and a good friend of mine told me about Fortnite it was fun ... but I felt it was missing more. You know that feeling of being knee deep in your own blood holding on for dear life when an unsuspected goes straight to the loot box of your first victim a great trap just empty out a clip on them and maybe wait for the next on or move on. It felt glorious and that's the feeling I got from this game. I made the mistake of first purchasing the game preview on the Xbox and although fun it was very obvious so much was needed but I played on. A couple days pass and I read update 1.0 has come up for PC I figured 'it's christmas soooo what the hell why not'. In my 5th game i win my first chicken dinner on PC a victorius moment in which I made sure to eat every damn meat of those bones while stuffing some damn mashed potato and gravy in my mouth while I was chewing that glorious chicken because we all know that's how it's meant to be ate! Only thing that bothered me was in the 6th game when I ran to an apparent hacker I don't remember his full name but I remember the last digits of his username *sigh*666 ... yes the damn devil himself killed me and when I looked at the deathcam all I saw was blasphemy. This demon of jackal's **ssy didn't even spot me all it did was unload a clip on the ground and I was dead my soul wrecked by the way I left not even facing this demon of perplexed idiocracy. Every game after that all I can do is watch the ground to be prepared in my attempt to at least try and dodge those bullets spawned from hell in my sleep I'm only full of nightmares of the way I never saw it's face just a blurry bastard laughing over my dead corpse.Seriously tho loved the game here on PC big improvement from game preview on XBX1(obviously).,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

If you love spending countless hours trying to improve your playing ability to enjoy this game even further then you can go ahead and shove that enthusiasm right into a BlueHole because when you start to enjoy this game even just a bit it will bring you complete frustration and anger beyond your wildest imagination. I will however recommend this game when the developers will realize that revenue isnt important especially when cheaters get banned then rebuy the game over and over but quality in gameplay is what wins over the hearts and minds of loyal PUBG gamers. I would like to suggest if I may that instead of banning cheaters why not put all cheaters on dedicated servers with other cheaters after multiple cheating reports and let them get a taste of their own medicine.

When I first got the game though it most definitely needed optimization and bug fixes and such it was far superior to it's hacker simulator state that it is in right now. Everything is perfect about this game and I hate to point out what erveryone else is complaining about but Asian servers definitely need to be locked and though they did just release an anti cheat update it still needs fixing. Not only is it not very effective on cheats being used ingame but it causes rubber banding and other weird bugs considering movement.

Don't be intimidated but I'm not a stereotypical guy. If anything I'll be the one in the kitchen D. In all seriousness this game is not as great as it seems. If you actually happen to read this review this game sucks. Dishonest developers who pretend to listen to community feedback a 1.0 tag to make the game look better yet it feels like it is in early beta changes that are made to the game just to change it not serving a real purpose etc. The gameplay itself would be fine if it weren't plagued with horrible instability and optimization cheaters and hackers and truly awful servers and hit registration. I've quit this game because every time I should be getting a kill the game won't give it to me. You feel like a bag of popcorn when going against any other player they take around twenty shots to kill or at least it feels this way due to ping but you'll take about a hit and be knocked instantly to half of your health when you had better amor and weaponry that your opponent. This game is horribly inconsistent and not fun to play. Please save your thirty dollars so you won't be earraped by chinese players who don't stay in their own server and developers who don't understand that it's ok to region lock a playerbase that has three servers closer to their homeland than the U.S. servers. Can't even play the game I paid for anymore and it has descended through the greed of bluehole as they make more money they decide to not fix the game and simply add the cashgrap lootboxes.

You have to fire while keeping in mind the distance between you and target. If the target is moving you can't just put your cross hair on the target and shoot it won't hit.

There are some glitches such as cars flying into space. Cars merging together and blowing up. Cars merging into rocks and blowing up. Basically the glitches are mainly with cars.

2018-03-06,0,0,121,False,Recommended,PUBG the game+lot of players+Big maps+Vehicles+Great combat+Lot of weapons+Much better performance than it used to be+Different match different scenariosPlayerunknown's battlegrounds doesn't need introduction. But just in case...It's a battle royale game where you jump out of the plane with 99 other players find loot to kill them and at the same time be in the zone which gets smaller every few minutes.I've seen a lot of people complaining about the hackers but I really dont think it's that big of a problem. With 90+ hours I've never met single one or maybe I didn't noticed him but either way I don't see it as a problem. On the china servers it's definitely worst.Combat in this game is easy to learn hard to master situation. You basically find a gun maybe even a scope and you point on the enemy and try to shoot him nothing hard really except for the hip fire distance to enemy (need to prefire him) and your location on the map. If your enemy is gonna have a better position (better cover high ground etc) you'll need to get a better position too or you'll be dead. But don't forget about the zone oh dear how many time have I died to zone when I was fighting other guy DYou're gear is very important(Make sure to look for helmets and vests) cause headshots are very deadly if you're not careful enough. Try to find long range weapons cuz usually you're gonna use them more than close range (usually you shoot to people pretty fair away from you)You can play solo but i recommend squad cause is soo much more fun to play with friends for me. And fighting another squad is always adrenaline DAnd what I don't like about this game?Well...Let's start with server delay. By that i mean every time I want to pick something from the ground I have to pick it twice or more times. It used to be worse but it's not perfect yet. Also sometimes I have to reload twice cause the servers didn't register it probably.However I am happy to say that this doesn't appear to be a problem when you're shooting st someone the hitboxes seems to be right.Then there is this felling of repetition.Now this is only subjective but after quite a lot hours in the game I am pretty much doing the same over and over again. I jump out of a plane land look for weapons loot and start killing other players and going to the zone. Yes every game is different but you're doing same thing as before. I don't want compare this game with different one but let's just this. In Hunt Showdown you're playing as a hunter and you'll be trying to kill the boss and escape with bounty to one of 3 extraction points. However u can play this game so many ways. Especially in the night missions you can choose to sneak trough the bushes and look for Hunters you can play agresive rush in a try to kill the boss and escape listen for footsteps and other sounds of other hunters and plan your ambush there's just so much you can do.I am not here to on pubg really.It's a great game and I understand why is it so much popular. I still really enjoy playing it just not that much as I used to.So should you buy this game? If u vave a decent PC and you like battle royale games then yeah go for it!But don't play this game only because everyone else is playing it even if you don't really enjoy it cuz why would you be playing a game that you don't enjoy. bugs server delay repetive gameplay almost no stealth and of course toxic community but that's in every popular game sadly (I can't really think about more negatives.After all it's not a bad gameI'll give it 8/10!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-02-21,0,0,42,False,Recommended,Good Game still has all kinds of glitches should be Beta. My biggest gripe is with the rampid cheating throughout the game. Reporting people has no effect and looking at the leadeboard they are easy to spot with headshot ratios in the 90%. It's an issue with a lot of games but seriously needs to be addressed. You spend 30 60 mins hiding and stocking only to be aimbotted by one of the three cheaters left at the end of the match. I've done my research plenty of websites youtube videos and in game experience to back it up. It's fun to play but you can't take eny of these too seriously when they don't care about the cheating I guess cheaters bought the product too.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-01-01,0,0,293,False,Recommended,"For those of you that don't want to read my whole review here is the tl dr. This is one of the best games of 2017 in my opinion. This game is fun and action packed. It's not as glitchy and full of hackers and everyone thinks there are (I've only every encountered 1 or 2) and it's way more enjoyable if you have a few friends to play it with. For those of you who want to here the long version here it is. *Gameplay* The gameplay is really solid. It goes like this Find weapon kill people move into circle kill more people die and get second place rinse and repeat. The movement of the character feels nice and the maps are built around the realistic physics engine which helps make it feel emmersive. All the guns feel powerful to shoot. And there is sorta a learning curve to the weapons but if you have played any other realistic shooter you should feel right at home. *Graphics* By no means is this the best looking game. I think it is good looking but not the best. The view distance for foliage is not very high even when the setting is turned all the way up. I know this is for performance reasons but it is noticable. And that is kinda the theme for this ""graphics"" section of my review. They didn't make it the best looking game because then people couldn't run it. It does look good but not the best. I really don't know how else to put it. *Hackers* Just like I mentioned above I don't think hackers are really a big deal for this game. I've only ran into 1 or 2 hackers in my 90 hours of play time. Just recently the devs banned 1.5 million people for hacking. That goes to show that yes there are hackers in the game but yes the devs are working on getting them out of it. I don't think this is going to be a big deal for a lot of people. And just remember some people are just better than you. I DOESN'T mean they are hacking. *Optomization* It is true that the game is not that optomized. You will have to have a decent computer to run it. But not anything outrageous. I have a GTX 1060 6GB with an I5 6600k (OC to 4.6GHz) and I play at 1440p medium to ultra settings and I get a constant 60 FPS. Yes the optomization could be better but it's good enough to have a fun gaming session. *Competitors* There's no doubt that Fortnite is a huge competitor to PUBG. I think PUBG is more fun but that is just my opinion. I see the appeal in Fortnite. It's way better optomized and it's free... But I promise you PUBG will continue to get support for years to come. I think it has a longer lasting appeal. But again that's just me. Ok I'm done now. If you want a recap go back up and read my tl dr because my fingers are getting tired of typing.

2018-01-29,0,0,81,False,Not Recommended,Mediocre is how I would describe this game. It is fun to play with friends at times but recent development choices are ruining the game. Loot crates were recently introduced that you have to pay to open. So you play the game and get points you then use those points to get a crate which holds a vanity item. It used to be you just spent the points and you got the crate and open it but now you spend your points and have to Pay $2.50 to open a crate that is just going to give you a junk vanity item. The whole thing is just sad. This game is really not finished at all it doesn t look or play particularly well and constantly has connection and bug issues.

Got bored.Bought PUBG.Got in game dropped in at the military base got wrecked in 5 minutes.Second round Won first place with my squad of friends.Third round Won first place with that same squad.Best shooter with squads I've played and the adrenaline rush is SO real.**********EDIT**********Game's good however after 250+ Hours Ingame and by no means am I the worst player in the world. When nobody is hacking 6+ kills a game is rather easy fire fights are extremely intense fair footed shot for shot killing fun and you do NOT DIE INSTANTLY EXCEPT to the obvious ""Oh crap he blew my vest or helmet off then finished me just like that Should've ran"". The hacks come back a couple weeks after every big update and it pretty much goes like this.Jump in land loot get a kill because someone had nothing loot a couple more buildings notice a sickly trend of really good loot getting left behind in crates ammo missing but main guns like M416 SCAR L KAR98's etc all getting left behind (Doesnt happen when people survive more than 2 minutes before getting wrecked) get outside think you're safe leaving a city get killed by an instant headshot or full auto at a distance watch kill cam get extremely frustrated and scream at your friends that you hate this game while they're in complete denial of the entire situation.What to expect from a hackers kill cam EVERY time Erratic snappy movement due to Aim bots cross hairs following you through buildings behind cover because of ESP hacks quick switch between rifles 0.01 second scope times no scope kills at 100+ meter distances using assault rifles on full auto snap to instant headshot with pistols and shotguns at insane distances and even aimbots tracing your head with no scope and no recoil in short range (Pay attention to bullet holes behind you if you're in stairwells).The dead giveaway is always the de sync caused by how insanely fast their cursor is snapping around to your position while you're hiding/running through buildings and cover and then to you when you pop out.Long story short I originally recommended this game however I've changed my mind. It was amazing hopping in and EARNING those first 20 or so chicken dinners within 30 matches in the beginning. The Intensity The Adrenaline rush of winning in a game where the odds are SO low was unrivaled compared to any BR games that existed in the beginning Including H1Z1 but for it to amount to what it's become?

2018-01-19,0,0,399,False,Not Recommended,ORIGINAL REVIEW (20th January 2017) I love this game it's great WITH FRIENDS..However now with the millions of daily players the downfall currently is trying to play with other people that live in your country... you can't...your duo or squad is always asians.. every match.. that either don't talk to you or can barely understand you...I play OCEANIC servers here in Australia and I can't even play with other Aussie's.This seems to be one of the biggest problems in terms of gameplay other than some optimisation issues and hackers.PUBG corp need to implement some kind of ping lock. The sooner they address this problem the sooner I'll consider changing my review..If you agree with me do the same. write a similar review about your opinions voice our concerns guys! UPDATE/EDIT does anyone think they'll get their together?it's like they don't give a flying crap wether they fix the game or not never have I ever been so frustrated because of a stupid bug that occurs EVERY GOD DAMN GAME! MY MICROPHONE STOPS WORKING EVERYTIME I LAND ON THE ISLAND! not to mention all the CHEATING ASIANS flooding EVERYONEs servers god forbid any of us actually get to enjoy this game.PUBG CORP ARE RUINING EVERYTHING! No weather? no rain or fog? on top of that charging us for crates that should be opened with INGAME BATTLEPOINTS!!!??? . This game is getting worse every second...They don't listen to their player base instead the money hungry s just sit around scratching their balls discussing the ESPORT and CHARITY EVENTS instead of dealing with the actual problems at hand...?LIKE WHAT THE ACTUAL ING !??? What does it take to get through to these S!??How hard is it to optimise this game add some sort of ping lock and fix all these bugs???WHAT DOES IT TAKE TO MAKE BRENDAN GREENE AND PUBG CORP STOP BEING SO NEGLIGENT?The amount of negligence is an actual joke!At the moment I STILL can't recommend this current state of the game,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-01-26,0,0,671,False,Not Recommended,I played PUBG for 671 hours before uninstalling today and writing this review. I have won solo duo and squad games inclluding winning 1 v squad. I am by no means the best player on Earth but believe I can make a fair assesment.Pros The game does a good job with the gun mechanics things like bullet drop and recoil are nicely done. There is a good veriety of weapons and I woudn't call any weapon garbage. The game does have pixel level accuracy. If someone is holding up a weapon and you shoot them in the chest it may hit their arm instead and do different amounts of damage. If you see someone's nose stick out the corner of a window you can head shot them. The design of the maps is well done in that there is a good amount of verity multiple entry/exit points and vaulting added a much needed way of entering/exiting buildings/walls easily.Cons The game is very heavily luck based in that you never know what items you will find and were you will find them. Yes there are areas in which higher quality loot spawns but they are very crowded and then again becomes luck. Are you going to be the one to drop in front of a smoke grenade or a full automatic weapon. The majority of the game will be spent looting and walking for 20 or so minutes and then being killed by someone you never see. Hacking happens far more often than any game i've seen in a long time. I have had arrows sticking out of my neck moments after dropping out of the plane to enter the map. I have been headshot in a closed room by a guy aming at a mountain. It is very difficult to practice the aiming/shooting mechanics other than to drop into a major city and hope you get lucky since player interaction happens so infrequently. I have had many games where I never saw another living person until I was killed by one. Sever lag while not game breaking IMO does happen every so many games. I've been on a motocycle and had lag toss me upside down while driving on a road and I've had instances where I get my car stuck inside a solid object which makes my car explode. This does not happen very often but it can. I believe all of the maps are too big. There is a truth in the fact that one of the tags for PUBG is 'Walking SImulator'. They really need a smaller map.Unfortunately there is only a like or dislike button otherwise I would pick 'its ok'. If you like a more realistic battle royal game that is skill/strategy based you'll like this game a good amount of the time. If you've played games heavily based in aiming like Counter Stike you'll pick it up easy. if you've played FortNite and think you'll jump into this no problem you may be in for a suprise. For me personally I have gotten to the point I am frustrated more often than I am happy. I log off angry more often than I log off satisified that I spent my time on PUBG. If you like battle royal games its worth a try if you just want to try it because its popular I think you'll be dissapointed.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

A lot of players on North American servers are from other parts of the world lagging up the servers.Some of the animations/models are a bit chinsey.Can be frustrating spending 10 minutes gathering good gear only to get wiped out in a 2 second firefight.Needs shot directional meter showing you what direction you got hit from.

2017-05-03,0,0,411,False,Not Recommended,Don't buy this game the dev's do not care about the community. Cheaters in every other game and the solution isnt stopping cheating its banning them. Obviously if that worked the problem wouldnt persist. In addition the game was 'released' prematurely with dozens of bugs that have existed for over a year now and the lack of a map selection a looting system that rewards luck rather than skill and more RNG than simulated dice.Original review I am in the pre load area and decide to take my clothes off and run around naked. Land on the ground... still naked. First thing i can put on is a ballistics mask so I look super BDSM. After that I aquire shirt vest trench coat trousers helmet but no shoes. Also plenty of guns and ammo D. 30 minutes later me and my friend are camping a house and a prick walks in and shoots my buddy. I kill his attacker with a shotgun and steal my buddy's shoes that I have coveted the whole game. Next I kill the attacker's buddy and head for the center with a motorcycle running over one dude and blasting the other with my shotgun before being killed by the electric barrier traveling at lightspeed with me only a foot outside where it stops. End the game at team #4 with 4 kills for me 2 for my (deceased) partner. 10/10 would steal my best friend's shoes off his dead body again.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-06-12,0,0,282,False,Not Recommended,"I WANT to enjoy this game... but it seems that I CAN'T enjoy this game.First off if you are not a fan games where you must die repeatedly in order to achieve success (like Dark Souls for example) then you will likely not enjoy this game. *Puts on tin foil hat* Also every time I have something negative to add to this review Steam suddenly has a ""problem communicating with the servers."" *Take off tin foil hat* Play Area Restrictions As each match progresses the play area is reduced in intervals and anyone caught outside slowly starts losing health (which by the way gets worse as the match goes on). While the idea looks good on paper its execution (pun intended) is extremely harsh. Once the play area begins to constrict around its new projected field it contracts so rapidly that you are completely unable to keep up with it on foot. Basically you have two options Find a vehicle or stay ahead of the constriction. Sounds easy enough until the Random Number Generator decided that you have to run 2 kilometers in under 3 minutes. Good luck... oh wait you died. Nevermind.*UPDATE* 3 Jan 18 Nothing's changed here the circle is still brutal and unforgiving. Simply put it is a means to limit the playtime of each match. Personally this seems to me like the vast majority of the player base just doesn't have any patience to play the long game. I'd still rather die in a gunfight than to nothing or no one. Vehicles The transportation in the game is decent up until you start driving on hills. This is where either you luck with the RNG runs out again or the physics engine needs some work. Haven't quite figured out which it is yet but anyways... if you try to jump a vehicle off a hill or a ledge it will start rotating in a random direction that doesn't even make sense for the angle it left the ground. This happens less often with the heavier vehicles though so at least they go that part right. But to make things worse the controls provided in game to adjust the vehicle in flight do not respond fast enough to correct this error. This is counter intuitive with my previous point that the play area restrictions are too fast. You have to go full speed to keep up and if you're stuck in a hilly area you might as well just kill yourself. Or quit. Yeah quitting is faster.*UPDATE* 3 Jan 18 Nothing new here either. Several instances of flipping vehicles over the smallest of bumps. Advice for new players Slow down speed bumps ahead. Game Crashes/Not Responding *UPDATE* 3 Jan 18 Had one crash since the game went Full Release out of about 40 games or so. Hacker Handling It happens in just about every game to some extent someone hates losing so much that they have to cheat or they do it just ""because they can."" Well I've had 5 questionable deaths now (compared to the other 90 something where I know I got outplayed) that made me wonder how the hell the other player managed the feat. While I wansn't able to prove anything I was still curious if I even COULD report a hacker. Well it turns out you have to go register to a third party web site which just so happened to crash every time I tried to register an account. Wonderful.Also the rate in which I seem to get loot f*cked makes me wonder how some of these players are doing so much better than I am when it comes to finding good gear. Either they are the Developers and they're on a power trip or the top ranked players know the developers and are really good at brown nosing. Now 150 matches in and this theory hasn't been proven wrong yet.*UPDATE* 3 Jan 18 After having learned that there were over 1.5 million players banned for hacking/cheating AND the implementation of a death camera (THANK YOU) I have been religiously watching everytime someone eliminates me. The half second delay between what you see and what actually happens is a bit of a throw off but I have witnessed a few players using some kind of auto aim hack. Roughly 1 in 10 deaths look like the reticle is locked onto my avatar. The fact that so many people feel the need to ""mod"" the game is pathetic and creates a poor play experience. If I could I would summon the Terrible Terry Tate Office Linebacker to take care of each and every one of you. Glitches HIT DETECTION If i am aiming down my sight why the hell is my bullet making contact with a vehicle I am standing next to? So I'm trying to shoot someone with my muzzle shoved up my car's a$$? Come on. *UPDATE* 3 Jan 18 No new instances but (See Next) Bullet Penetration There is none. There are planks of wood that will block your 7.62 rounds. Seems like an oversight to me. *UPDATE* 3 Jan 18 Got worse. Now you can't shoot through fences or metal railings with 6 inches of clearance between the bars. Had a guy dead to rights with an SKS and 4x scope looking through a metal railing. *TING!* No damage. Had to get all the way around the railing. ***NEW*** Weapon Switching There have been a couple games now since the Official Release where I am prevented from switching weapons especially in critical situations. If I run out of ammo in my primary weapon and try to switch to my secondary instead of reloading SOMETIMES it will let me. At first it was because I had Aim Down Sight set to toggle and while I was aiming down the sight I couldn't switch. Okay fine. They now have separate key binds for ADS and just Aiming so I did that AND set ADS to Hold. Problem solved? Nope. Other Concerns Aiming through Windows and other Openings So when you're trying to aim down sight though a window from a crouched position while adjacent to said window you don't always have enough height to see over the bottom of the window sill to actually see through. So you have to stand. I can't say if the developers designed the windows like this on purpose to force players to stand while aiming out of windows but why would anyone want to do that? I disagree with this and would consider it a design flaw because based on the height of the character models compared to most windows I should be able to stand on my knees and aim through a window without exposing too much of myself. As many times as I've been shot and killed from concealed positions I don't see this making a huge difference. I still won't know where the shot came from.*UPDATE* 3 Jan 18 Still not fixed. Also seems like other players CAN shoot through windows while crouched but I (or my teammates in squads) can not. Is there a secret pay wall for this ability that I don't know about? Doors Can we PLEASE see an option to SLOWLY AND QUIETLY open a friggin door? I don't care if it take three full seconds but having that option would be an improvement.*UPDATE* 28 Nov 17 No change though this one is a request and not a bug.**NEW** 16 Jan 18 WEAPON JAMMING/NOT FIRINGAfter the last update I am experiencing increased instances of my weapons NOT firing when I pull the trigger (click mouse button). This has led to several deaths that could have been kills and I don't know if it's actually a glitch or if it's the server lagging at just the wrong moment or if there's a new hack on the market. PROS First Person View Mode Free updates no paid DLC Vaulting and Mantling is in and it works great so far. *UPDATE SUMMARY* 3 Jan 18 Some things fixed others stay the same. The game itself ins't bad. I still play it because I want to make it better... but the HACKERS just ruin what could be an otherwise great game. With about 3 million concurrent players and almost HALF that number of banned players cheating is a MAJOR problem these guys are forced to deal with rather than focus on making the game better. So for all you pieces of dog that can't play the game without a hack running... congratulations! You still suck.

You might think your car stopped with that awesome powerslide you just did because its still on your screen but if you dont wait 3 seconds before you get out or your behind will get smashed by the side of it for no other reason than lag. Also you might play for 30 minutes and get in a top 5 situation just to see a ''Host closed connection'' report. ''Esport ready'' ))))))))))))))))))))))))))) this was made in may 2017. Now its 17th january 2018 game havent changed a bit except theres more skins and lootboxes that require keys to open instead of fixing this piece of I wish i could give another bad review and i wish i could get my ing money back.

2018-01-16,0,0,172,False,Recommended,Still a lot to do/improve but overall very lovely game. Never felt such adrenaline and joy at the same time by just killing opponents. Game works very vell on ultra setting yet still it needs some improvements. I do recommend this game to every person that likes to play a game with friends or alone but i do not recommend this game for people that only look for bugs and unimprovements.Cheers guys.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-01-16,0,0,283,False,Recommended,As long as you challenge yourself by NOT hiding in bushes the entire game this game doesn't get old.The issues going on with the chinese servers are whatever but the game is still great as it stands. On top of that the devs clearly show that they are working on adding more content with whispers already of a 3rd map.I would recommend this to anyone that enjoys a challenge. 9/10 would PUBG again.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-01-16,0,0,1122,False,Not Recommended,"Welcome to Playerunknown's Battlesgrounds. These used to be playerdriven without any kind of hacker community apparent. Within a few patches however it became a digital wasteland filled with hackers and bugs abound. Cars spontaneously doing backflips from resting state sending you thousands of miles into the air Guns having an indefinite accuracy making the closest engagements acts of wonder. Hit boxes are amiss loot askew Recoil scripts/hacks are abound and my most favorite inaccurate representations of grenades/utility grenades' arc. I've missed several grenades because of the inaccuracy of the arc. Its more just a guessing game instead of giving you an actual chance at throwing them. I was one of the first to brave the storm with this game and now it has become something unenjoyable. Still playable but extremely lopsided due to hackers and bugs. If the game fixes its issues with hackers fix the weapon bugs true recoil and realistic damage of weapons it will be a solid 8/10. But as of this moment I'd rather recommend players to Last Man Standing. Which is just as equally plagued but doesn't cause the disappointment of spending 30 dollars on instability and inconsistency. Let's also not forget the millions of dollars this company has acquired yet cannot fix any of the true issues at hand. I have achieved over 30+ chicken dinners all with photographic proof over 600+ hours of gameplay. Pros Great team game extremely engaging.Immersion of both environment and situation.Cons HackersGun DamageGun AccuracyVehicle Bugs which send you off in random directions or spontaneously kill youEnvironmental catastrophies in which traffic cones stop vehicular movement from any speed including Tin fences singular barrels caution barriers etc.While skydiving into your area your parachute has a chance to stop working completely or completely launch your character in a direction killing him/her instantly. I'd love to recommend this to the next person but understand this game you may purchase was titled ""E sports ready"". It comes with an unprecedented wave of disappointment until the multi million dollar corporation that owns this title steps forward and actually engages these issues. Until then just another money pit with hackers and complete pandemonium.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

It's so intense and makes you on your knees this is the type of game that makes you angry when you die because you know you got outplayed or get adrenline rushes when you're near the end of the round and only 3 people alive ane end up winning.

2017-12-20,0,0,643,True,Not Recommended,Okay my last review was positive but oh man. im trying my best to support these devs but they prefer to focus on releasing crates than fixing the gameMajor faults that they need to fix and noone mentions. 1. The new smoke grenade isnt visible the same to everyone some people dont even see the smoke and they can kill you like you are like an idiot in the middle of nowhere. 2. Same with Grass there are no grass for everyone in the same places. If im hidden in the grass naked the snipers that have some height (on miramar) wont see any grass at all. Plus. 3.Optimization is good but far away from good enough.4. TOO MANY MACRO USERS. a lot of people a ton of em are using Macros to win the game that gives them great advantages.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-06-30,0,0,21,False,Not Recommended,I can only recommend this game to people who have patience and is competative. You're either good at the game or you're absolute trash. I join the game 1 minute later I'm dead. The parachute radius is WAY too low compared to the size of the map. Obviously the plane moves but the distance you may travel is horrible. It'd be much better if you could utitilize the full size of the map when jumping to spread players out as much as possible.Unless you have a good PC you'll have a hard time running the game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-07-17,0,0,639,True,Recommended,This game is alot of fun (better in squads or duos mode) realistic battle royal (it is buggy and somewhat hard to run but that is part of why it is in early access) you will die to the circle a few times but it gets easyer the more you play10/10 would recomend tip as i said it is better with friends so get some friends on bord to play in duos or squads (squads is groups of 4 BUT you can play in a 3 man group D ),PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
