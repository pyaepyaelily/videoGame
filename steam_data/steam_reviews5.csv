2018-11-25,0,0,683,False,Recommended,MH World is one of the most revolutionized in the series for newcomers and veterans alike. Interactable Enviroment Using Scoutflies to Locate Monsters A Small Crossbows on your left arm ( Slinger ) and Various Types of Mantle that provides different traits are all welcoming additions. Monsters can provide you some challenge but if done correctly is really walk in the park but can be fun too. Graphic/Visual have never looks this good in any other MH Titles. Most Importantly bring your friends along. It makes it 10x more fun as Monster Hunter is always known to hunt with your pals. The only downside of MH World is there no G Rank theres only Low &amp High Rank and what comes close to G Rank is Tempered &amp Arch Tempered Monsters. Theres nothing really looking forward to for Veterans that previously played the older MH Titles. A G Rank Expansion ( Iceborne ) is coming this year Autumn YEAH!!! Overall MH World truly delivers it to the old familiarity and newly crafted experience to the latest gen. Really Recommended to pick this game even if its full price.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2019-01-08,0,0,201,False,Recommended,I played a ton of this back when it was released on the PS4 and had a blast. However because I played it solo/with random players I picked it back up on PC to play with friends who also just picked this game up for the first time during the winter sale. And it's been so much more fun than ever before! The game still has some issues with connectivity from time to time and the fact that you cannot join friends in assigned quests until everyone has viewed the cutscene in their own quest is completely unnecessary and takes away from the flow of the game but besides that? This is definitely a fun experience to sink a lot of hours into with a group of friends!Just be aware that there is a lot to take in as a new player and it can be easy to feel discouraged to try out the different weapons offered and all of the features in the game so take your time with it!,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2019-01-01,0,0,20,False,Recommended,Brilliant game I love it.The performance is not so bad as people here say. It looks kinda blurry even with max settings but the overall look of the game is amazing.Story and voice acting are okay nothing special just okay.Combat however is excellent it's not too slow sure it can be a little clunky sometimes but once you're used to it it will feel great.

2019-01-01,0,0,69,False,Recommended,Monster Hunter World is GOTY of 2018 for me. The game for me is 10/10 and gives free DLC s unlike other games which is hard to find. I bough the game on console because I couldn t wait and ended up buying the game on pc once it came out. I would buy this game at full price again anytime but if you don t own it buy it with a cheaper price especially if you haven t played Monster Hunter before.Pros First week the game had some connectivity issues but they fixed it super fast. Performance issues after launch fixed at the same time as connectivity issues. Constantly updating with Free content Armor weapons DLC's Easy to learn the game and monster s movement. Fun with friends constantly boosting each other. Tons of classes to choose from.* Lots of tutorials out there to help new players* Poogie the pig &lt 3Cons Some of you will die a lot. At some point there will be a difficulty spike. It requires a decent pc for the best quality. Keyboard setting kind of odd (also first time this game is on pc) cut some slack on them,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-11-26,0,0,252,False,Recommended,Was it worth waiting almost a year for a PC Version? Yes. Definitely YES. A great action game and a perfect addition to a series of games finally Monster Hunter comes to PC where you can enjoy hunting old and new monsters solo or with friends (4 man Coop). It's a great game for both beginers but also veterans to the series and has regular updates and events. Definitely worth it's full price,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-11-26,0,0,31,False,Recommended,Monster Hunter is a game that truly perfects its own gameplay loop. You engage in fun hunts for materials to engage in other fun hunts. What makes the hunts fun is that the monsters are not entirely predictable and while they have their own patterns to master they vary them enough to be reptetitive. While there is a lack of weapon variety and the roster is smaller than in other games the game should satisfy anyone looking for a deep gameplay system tied around a satisfying loop... unless you are trying to farm materials like the gems then you sometimes feel like you are going on more hunts than needed.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-27,0,0,263,False,Recommended,MONSTER HUNTER WORLD a 60 dollar game without any microtransactions.thanks!despite playing the beta on PS4 a long long time ago and having an aneurysm while trying to solo nergigante i've always had this game in my crosshairs and only a few weeks ago decided to make the purchase.suffice to say i don't regret it at all!my experience with the game so far in a nutshell i've played most of the game solo in order to get a hold of the steep learning curve (given i've never played a monster hunter game before). while i do get the occasional network error aka the classic mw1 it is in no way intrusive to my current experiences and i feel it is more of a result of unnecessary network traffic since it always happens in the hub area. while it does get annoying every now and then when i want to kick back and enjoy slaughtering a giant beast with some pals the solutions aren't time consuming or in depth. all i have to do is back out to the main menu and re enter. (EDIT now that the game is all patched up i rarely get an MW1 error and when i do it's usually a fault on my end)i won't deny that there are likely a lot of people who get screwed hard by network issues but so far everything for me and my friend has went smoothly. the game is optimized pretty well for how it looks with some astonishing views and unique beastly designs for monsters. while i would complain that some textures do look fairly low res in comparison to others it is in no way breaking my immersion and instead serves as a small annoyance instead of an eyesore. the sound design in this game is phenomenal with some monsters sounding downright terrifying and their impacts sounding as if they shatter the earth beneath them. i really like how they pulled off just about everything in this game everything flows together very smoothly in my opinion.i've heard of a potential bug which may or may not affect me in the future regarding xeno jiiva but i'm fairly certain the problem is well under my control given that i've made sure to play it careful and backup my save regularly (as i'd also advise you to do just in case!)the only thing i've found to really agitate me about this game is the occasional wonky hit registration (looking at you nergigante) which results in either unnecessary damage or worse an unnecessary faint which ends up leading to an unnecessary quest failure. while these are a thorn in my side i still find that they are fairly few and far between but it'd still help a ton to add some polish to these.of course do play this with a controller! it makes things a lot more compact and easy to understand. (EDIT nergigante's kryptonite is diving using a greatsword makes this much easier to do with its sheathe time)this game is wonderful and i've had a blast playing it despite being new to the series whether it's admiring the view taking on the towering ferocious beasts that roam the new world or just having fun tinkering with armor for optimal fashion. i've binged this game for a while with the only thing breaking that streak being my friends wanting me to party up with them to enjoy another title together. make it a goal to at least give this a try!,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-11-26,0,0,235,False,Recommended,You would think that the loop of checking gear tracking and beating a monster and then making more gear would get boring. And it does... after you have learned to beat ALL the different monsters and tried ALL the weapons/loadouts. Took me 200+ hours on release and there is more stuff in the game now.Negative reviews were mostly about technical issues that should be fixed now though I can't really comment about that since I didn't get those problems even at launch.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2019-01-02,0,0,46,False,Recommended,Amazing I love everything about the game. If you've never played monster hunter world you NEED to give it a try. Some of the main selling points as to why this is one of my main games is that it requires skill there is a lot to learn and you can play it with friends!! Many games have the same things of course but with monster hunter being able to read the monsters attack or being able to buffer your attack and feeling your attack on the monster as you perfectly calculate your attacks are extremely rewarding for a player.Great game for individuals teams and friends.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-11-23,0,0,268,False,Recommended,TL DR Game Score 7.5/10Pros *Appeals to both Western and Japanese game preferences*Engaging Hunts*Environment feels alive*Combat is pretty satisfying*Overall pretty god damn funCons *Story is not the main appeal*Weird multiplayer design*Not the good kind of grindy*Lack of variety Monster Hunter World is an awesome game and a great step forward to unite the Japanese and Western preferences when it comes to videogames into an enjoyable experience for both sides. Capcom took the risk and put great effort in creating an outstanding amalgam of both.It may still feel a little bit weird for us here in the west but it is accesible enough to provide a great gaming experience where we don't feel too alienated. Most of the battles are great and challenging for those who are learning and interesting enough to keep those who have mastered the game engaged even after the 10th or 100th time hunting the same monster (except Zorah Magadaros and Xeno'Jiva). The combat is unique for every weapon and even though you can use every one of them once you find your main and use that weapon in combat you'll feel true power when going out in hunts.The world itself feels alive with its small fauna populating the scenarios its passive inhabitants becoming part of the chain food in front of your eyes its monsters that show how they've adapted to their environment and the turf wars that trigger when monsters engage in battle over a territory. Even after all that the game is not without its issues. The story is regular at best and not the main focus of the game the multiplayer aspect is a little bit weird with a lot of limitations apparently dragged over from the previous games' design and while grinding is one of the things that makes the game interesting the decorations and augmentations system makes you feel like the grinding is really unfair. Finally the game lacks a lot of variety in its weapon and monster designs.I would definitely recommend this game especially to people new to the franchise but I'm aware that some of its flaws definitely need to be adressed in future updates or in the next installment. 7.5/10.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-12-27,0,0,231,False,Recommended,The good The core gameplay loop of killing monsters and making them into armor and weapons so that you can kill more monsters is absolutely fantastic. A huge variety of weapons that have very differnent playstyles. Tons of awesome armor. Cool monster deisgns with satisfying boss fights. The open world areas are really cool. Very high skill ceiling that is satisfying to improve. Really deep builds/customization. A lot of fun in multiplayer.The bad The interface is a complete trainwreck. The multiplayer system is needlessly difficult to use and actively discourages co op with randoms due to a single person being able to cause a complete mission failure. Multiplayer health monster scaling is bad (same health for 2 players or 4 players). A certain monster has hundreds of potential weapons another (much cooler one) has only a single weapon. The endgame RNG grind for decorations and augments has insultingly low drop rates to keep you farming. Visual variety on weapons is pretty poor. A lot of monsters are basically reskins of existing monsters with low monster count overall. Tons of pointless busywork in menus and farming/crafting items between hunts. Limited time event quests can be frustrating to grind out while they are active.Summary Easily the best Monster Hunter. If the Monster Hunter series seems interesting this is the one to jump in on. They have stripped out a ton of the cruft from previous titles but a lot still remains. Overall a great but heavily flawed game.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-12-26,0,0,211,False,Recommended,Safe to say MHW has turned into one of my all time favorite games.I'm generally not someone who REALLY gets into any kind of game. I usually play about 100 hours max and then just peace out (I do have some exceptions but you get the idea). I first played this game on PS4 around february ish thought it was decently fun but just kinda left it after I hit Pink Rathian. It initially struck me as fun but kinda tedious and a huge time commitment. Especially since I didn't have any friends who had a PS4 and this game. Then August rolled around and I decided to jump back in. I kinda had all the same feelings as earlier because I couldn't really get any of my friends to play it and trying to figure out the complicated game mechanics by myself was confusing for me. But after a few weeks I finally managed to get a Dark Souls buddy of mine to get it and start playing it with me. And holy canoli I instantly realized why there's such a huge following for this game. I actually ended up getting to the end game and I'm still somehow playing. It's hooked me like no other game has.It's kind of hard to explain how much better this game is with friends or just in co op. And yes this is a co op game at heart. But suffice it to say the combat is really satisfying the monsters are super cool the maps are beautiful there's a stupid amount of depth there's constant updates and I'm gonna be playing it for a long time to come. Although be warned how you go about playing co op doesn't make a whole lot of sense. It doesn't let you invite a friend to a main mission unless you both have watched to cutscene in said mission. So playing through the story together can be a little difficult. The only real negative thing I have to say is that the optimization for the game is not the best and a couple of the monsters are really broken difficulty wise (Vaal Hazak and Behemoth). But other than that it's freaking amazing.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-09-06,0,0,601,False,Recommended,Really good game with alot of Monsters. MUST PLAY ASAP.Edit They promised an accelerated release schedule at this rate PC will never catch up to consoles. Kulve Taroth took 84 days on consoles PC will take around 90 days for Kulve Taroth. The development team lied about the release schedule and that seriously infuriated me. If you're going to actually say something make sure its actually true. Or this will result in negative reviews. Remember the abomination of a port at launch with connection issues graphical issues. and the lack of commmunication? They promised that the PC port will match the port quality of consoles at launch yet the port was plagued with many issues that this should not have been released. For now this review will be a negative until I see massive changes for the better it will stay negative.Edit 2 Really good and they fixed teh bugs,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-13,0,0,45,False,Recommended,After 12 hours of gameplay I can say that this is a good game but has some major problems.The mouse seems to emulate the way a controller would control the camera. This isn't a huge issue when exploring the map but it can get annoying during a fight when you want to turn the camera fast to see the monster. The only way to turn off motion blur in the game seems to be turning off TAA. Also on Intel CPUs the game uses massive amounts of CPU (80 90%) but on an AMD system its only around 40 50% of CPU usage. The servers are also unstable at least at launch.The gameplay however is extremelly fun and surprisingly difficult at times with a wide variety of weapons to choose from. The soundtrack is fantastic and the game has tons of content in its grind based nature with tons of armor and weapons to collect.I would reccomend the game if you're willing to put up with the issues present. Otherwise wait for a patch or a sale.UPDATE All of the major problems I listed have been fixed. You can now turn off motion blur the game seems to run at a more consistant FPS the mouse controlls are fixed and the servers are no longer unstable. As the game is right now I would suggest buying it even at full price.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

Overnight they updated the game and after that I was able to run the game perfectly on med graphics.

They animate so beautifully that they never look like a collection of polygons and textures they look real. The AI for the monsters is similarly brilliant allowing them to easily find their way across large and complex levels interact with the environment reacti to the presence of other monsters and react to you. You will see monsters eat other monsters hunt in packs protect other monsters destroy parts of the environment and even some friendly interactions if you are well hidden.The areas they inhabit are similarly complex. Monster Hunter World has a surprising amount of verticality to it and a huge number of paths through any one area. Each time you enter an area you will find new paths you missed new tricks you can use new shortcuts to traverse the zone quickly. The level design is so good that you will constantly feel like you are learning about the area and simply travelling through each zone is a rewarding experience.The level design and monster design combine to make each area feel like a small ecosystem complete with plants to collect a food chain monsters that are passive to one another monsters that hunt natural traps and more. This is by far the best aspect of Monster Hunter World.Unfortunately when this game made the jump to PC it was riddled with porting problems. The porting problems originally had the game in a borderline unplayable state which is how the game got so many negative reviews. Fortunately nearly all issues (atrocious mouse controls broken multiplayer and a bug that made all lightning weapons and one zone cause stuttering) are fixed. There are still performance problems though.The performance is sub par. Not only will the game not run as well as you would expect given how it looks but there are straight up performance bugs.Even once you get past the performance problems though this is a far from perfect game. This Capcom team is seemingly incapable of doing basic things right. The controls are a sloppy mess the menu screens are infinite and disastrous timed missions bizarrely do not display a timer loads of gameplay mechanics exist simply to be annoying nothing in the game is well explained and enormous gameplay mechanics are never mentioned at all. Many small things that you have taken for granted in every other game you have ever played (how does someone even make options menus this convoluted?) will be botched in this game. It seems like all the care was put into the monsters and environments while everything else was designed by a janitor on loads of acid.The problems are not enough to ruin the fun though. Now that Capcom has finally fixed this port up enough that it is actually a functioning PC game it is a good purchase. Seeing the quality of the majority of the game really does make the bugs and bizzarely bad parts stick out though.The verdict This game is very good finally feels like a PC title and is worth buying as long as you can stomach the terrible drop rates and frequent BS.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2019-01-12,0,0,60,False,Recommended,Beating the out of huge monsters with freaking weapons. I never want to do something else.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-10-27,0,0,269,False,Recommended,I've been playing Monster Hunter games since their slow trickle to the western market and I've been following the series ever since. TLDR for anyone that has never played Monster Hunter before (or any game like it such as Dauntless Toukiden God Eater and the like.) I strongly recommend the game. try it out and I seriously doubt you'd be dissapointed. the game is gorgeous it feels wonderful and for those that are familiar with the MH series you should definitely give it a shot if you haven't already. Coming from a MH background I am familiar with the game's mechanics and nuances and Monster Hunter World has made SO many Quality of Life changes that it is mind boggling. While I will say that many of these QoL changes have likely been done to make it easier for newcomers to the series I still feel they are very welcome and it has streamlined much of the clunky and time consuming aspects that many of us veterans would be used to. Gameplay wise and at its core it has still captured what makes Monster Hunter at it's core SO much fun and that is that the monsters themselves. While likely seen as bosses to other games or those unfamiliar with the series they have still made all the monsters feel. alive and not exactly enemies for the sake of being enemies. They are all part of an ecosystem something akin to Jurassic Park with some anime thrown in. Each weapon type are all simple to learn hard to master. And the more time you spend playing the game the more you not only learn about the monsters you hunt but you become overall a better hunter and a master of your chosen weapon. If you use nothing but a specific weapon for an extended period of time then switch to something else it almost feels like a completely different game. Since each weapon has its own play style strengths and weaknesses. The best part of it all? ALL weapons are 100% viable to play through the whole game solo. Capcom have had a very long time ironing out all of the weapons over the years and I feel that the iteration of them all in MHW is one of the best 'version' of each weapon yet. They all feel great to use and a lot of fun.Graphically speaking the game is rather gorgeous. I wouldn't say it is the most optimised PC port to date but for the most part it is pretty solid. Still think there could be some more improvements to make the game smoother (and stop tanking frames at certain points/situations) but I've never had it to a point where the game became unplayable especially in such an action orientated title. Content wise I feel the game is pretty good. There is plenty to do farm acquire and obtain in your adventures and on its own I feel there is a good amount of content here. For Monster Hunter veterans however I feel you may be a bit... disappointed in the overall content. For those unfamiliar with monster hunter... this is what the game has and doesn t have in a nutshell Low rank monsters (yes) introduces most of the monsters. You could say low rank is the tutorial for the most partHigh rank monsters (yes) this is where the majority of the games content is for the most part. You'll be fighting HR monsters for most of your playtime farming their materials making armor upgrading weapons etc. G rank (no...?) okay for those that don't know what G rank is this is basically the endgame of Monster Hunter. Here. The monsters are stronger than ever. They will even have expanded move sets. Completely new armor sets to obtain. New weapons/upgrades to get. Having said that. MHW sort of...? has its own version of it but for the most part... I think it sucks. In MHW you get Tempered monsters. And at the end of the day the only real difference between HR and Tempered is that the Tempered monsters hit harder and are more likely to drop decorations that you use to help give you a little/major edge when customising your armor and skillsets. There is going to be Arch Tempered coming soon for those that have only been following the PC release of MHW since consoles already have it but really again. ONLY the Eldar Dragons have been Arch Tempered they DO give a new armor set with some variations to the skills they provide outside of that there are MINOR visual differences and thats it. SOME of them have new moves (and really I think its Teostra and thats it) but outside of that... they just hit harder again.... and that s it... its the laziest form of G rank I feel they could have done here.... and I feel they have seriously dropped the ball here....in the other Monster Hunter games. G rank was a step up again... new armor sets with completely new visuals... aka Low/High rank Rathalos armor looks different to G rank Rathalos etc and generally its not just some minor detail some armor sets are completely different to their normal counterparts which was SO cool imo.Not only that but the other Monster hunter titles have so many more monsters in its roster...MHW has 31 monsters in its roster... which isnt bad considering the MAJOR change that MHW is in comparison to the older titles in the series... but just for comparison...lets say monster hunter 4 as a comparison. Not ultimate... just the base game75I'm so annoyed that many new players won't see the glory that is the Nerscylla or the Gore Magala. Zinogre or Nargacuga. Gammoth or Rajang... there are SO many more monsters out there and some of them are SO cool/badass that I wish were in the game. now I understand that MHW is the first step in a new line of games so for what they have done. It has been a phenomenal job. But I am seriously hoping for new additions either as DLC or something as time goes on. But you can see where my dissapointment lies in terms of content. Especially coming from other MH titles. One thing that the PC version does have going for it though.... is mods... I've come from a gamming community where mods have done nothing but improve the current game.... mods from games like Dawn of War Fallout. Oblivion... etc mods have made some utterly AMAZING content that I feel once those incredibly dedicated and talented people get the hang of it... there is SO much potential for the monster hunter modding community. In time... we could have something truly glorious here. All in all Monster Hunter World is a fantastic game. Even if it is missing some of the content that people that have followed the series are familiar with. In time I feel this could really be an amazing new direction the series is going. Its first steps have been incredibly impressive so far... now to see where it goes...,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2019-01-12,0,0,250,False,Recommended,Fantastic game. I hesitated to buy it for such a high price even though it was on sale for around $50 Canadian when I bought it but it was worth every penny and I can safely say I'd justify the price to a friend. The hunts are varied and entertaining there are plenty of optional missions and side quests for us completionists out there and you can collect fish and tiny critters for your room which is the cutest. There are a lot of different weapons and each of them feels unique and fun to play.That said the game DOES have it's flaws the servers can give out for no reason sometimes and it'll kick everyone from a hunt with no way of returning from it. It's relatively rare in my personal experience but worth mentioning. The graphics sometimes like to take a minute to fully register for me so I have to endure a bit of blur at the start of some hunts. It doesn't last more than 20 seconds from what I've noticed.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

Despite being very demanding on hardware the game has no fidelity to show for it (antialiasing is very inconsistent and many textures are very low res despite being at max setting). Multiplayer is an abysmal experience as well constantly disconnecting with disrupting pop ups that will kill you in game. As of writing I cannot even find an online session only errors. Mouse controls also feel grotesque lacking raw mouse input. This game is not worth the price tag until they fix all these issues.Edit (10/09/18) Connectivity issues have been mostly resolved and while there has been some optimizations in terms of performance there is still a lot of room for improvements. Without the blatant connectivity issues I can at least recommend this game.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

Best Monster Hunter yet but there are a lot of things that i dislike about this one. If you wanna do a quest that involve a monster that you didn't see yet you must see the video related to the monster first or else nobody can join your quest. If you play with a friend that is at the same progression than you you must both go in different quest to see the video on your own then one of you quit and join the other one's quest. Also i know that this game is a port but i feel like we did wait a year for them to release it on pc but yet it feel like a console game i don't see any improvement made for PC. The game had the same issues than the console versions right at the start and it took them weeks to fix a couple. This is also the first Mh that i don't have clocked 300 hours on it unfortunatly and im pretty much done with it waiting for the expension to release..

(joking aside monster hunter does have a story but you wont be paying attention to that any time soon) grinding the game in general isn't grindy if you wont be dying a lot when you transition from low rank to high rank and when making end game equipment. farming for decorations is the only grinding youll be doing 24/7 cheating there is no anti cheat system in monster hunter. if you wanna cheat the game its up to you. but dont expect regular players to treat you lightly if they catch you cheating during a multiplayer session. just keep it to yourself there are players who want to play the game as it is. extra payables all the extra dlcs are cosmetics. emotes chat stickers and costumes for your handler. ""but how about the Fair Wind Charm? it gives bonuses!"" it does but youll be replacing that item and forget it even exists after a few hours of gameplay. multiplayer i HIGHLY recommend bringing along friends in this game. it does get very frustrating when you do your best but lose anyway and lose your resources because some random guy answered your SOS call and dies 3 times in a row. no friends? hate playing with people anyway? no worries the game actually amps the difficulty depending on how many players are joined in the quest. if you're playing alone the difficulty will be as it is. price if you're a bit sketchy about the game waiting for a sale never hurts. but if you play it long enough youll see what you paid for. PC requirements &amp graphics even im surprised on how beefy the requirements are. If you dont mind playing on not max graphics settings then it shouldn't be a problem. but if you're really picky when it comes to graphics there are a handful of negative reviews pointing out the graphics issue of mhw. haven't done my research much so i can't say anything useful either. p.s. Reviews pointing out how there are graphics settings that can't be changed through settings that has been changed now. events missed out on an event? dont worry monster hunter events are always set to repeat in a schedule. there's an official calendar for mhw where events are listed and when some events will repeat. combat system again it is not a hack n slash game if you try to play it as one you will end up like one of those scrubs pointing a negative review towards ""how bad"" mhw's combat system is. mh's combat has always been its center focus up until now and im very confident when i say its combat system has been smoother than ever. if you think it isn't you're either playing it wrong or it's really just not your preference. mods yes www.nexusmods.com overall I tried my best to review MHW without having to compare it to old monster hunter games (as it would be a pretty biased review and there are enough reviews for veteran players of mh to read and know how the game works.) It's definitely worth the pick up but the game isn't for everyone. There are games that seemingly have this unique aura of being able to garner such a wide and diverse playerbase that everyone pretty much knows the story or how to play the game. Monster hunter is NOT one of those games so it wouldn't be a big surprise that you like the game so much but your friends dont or vice versa. pick it up if you're a fan of monsters you're a fan of hunting monsters you're a fan of swinging impractically large weapons you're a fan of asmr (seriously the sound design of the game is amazing)",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

I've nerver played a MonsterHunter Game before this one so I was sceptical at first but a Mate wanted to play with me so I got the game.It really helps to have someone who played any MH Game before because it can be a bit overwhelming to handle all the aspects of the game (canteen buffs capturing ammo etc) but anyone can get into it (great tutorials for everything on youtube). Playing with friends is what makes this game such fun! I've never had such crazy moments in a game. If you want to play alone I would recommend to do so and not to team up with mates (espicially in the endgame) because there's a high chance they can make you fail your quest. Playing alone is the best and fastest way to farm and hunt monsters (eventough its more funny and challenging with friends).,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

Compared to previous titles this is a huge upgrade in terms of visuals and hitbox detection and with the iceborne dlc dropping at some point later in 2019 the amount of content and replayability in this game is incredible.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

One major downside in my opinion is the dry story. I wouldn't get this if that's what you're looking for. What I really liked beyond the gameplay was the system for cataloging monsters and endemic life as well as a record of the largest and smallest of each monster encountered. I wish there were more of the old monsters and more variation in weapon models but since they're still developing and releasing new content I have high expectations.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-12-25,0,0,191,False,Recommended,If you have been looking for an extremely fun satisfying and rewarding game that you can play both co op and solo then this is it. In a world full of huge terrifying beasts it becomes your job as a hunter to take them down. With a array of 14 weapons each with their own unique playstyles there's something here for everyone. If your the type to play tank or heavy hitting dps roles then the lace/gunlance or greatsword is for you. Maybe you're the type who likes to go in do damage and then quickly escape or dodge. In that case the dual blades Insect Glaive or long sword are the right fit for you. Or maybe you're looking for something with a bit of range Monster Hunter World has that coverd with the light/heavy bowguns and the regular bow and arrow. This game is all about taking down these huge monsters and carving their corpses for parts in order to craft better weapons and armor. It's a very simple gameplay loop but it never gets old because the game keeps throwing new and interesting challenges your way.I have thoroughly enjoyed my time with this game. I have had so much fun teaming up with my friends or challenging myself to take on a tough monster solo. And while regular updates can be slow (especially for PC) they still come out often enough to keep me coming back. With a new expansion coming out next year I can guarantee that I will keep coming back to this game for years to come.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

Once you get used to the somewhat slow deliberate moves you feel like you're swinging around a massive hammer that has real weight or experience whatever feel your choice of weapon has and with 14 different weapon choices there's a lot here. I've discovered new play styles even 200+ hours into the game. Each detailed monster fight requires a different approach (if they're near/higher than your gear level at least). The frequent free updates and events are also really nice. A bit of a time investment with the grinding playstyle but a really fun game.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

It eats so much time out of life. but here i am 75 hours into the game only level 15. Outside the typical stuff the actual gameplay just maeks you want to continue to beat monsters. It is like a light verison of the Dark Souls series in the sense that your first encounter with a monster results in a one hit kill. Or somehow they continuouly stun you and just come in for kills.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-12-24,0,0,14,False,Recommended,This game is my game of the year for 2018 if not for the last five years or so. I have 300+ hours played on PS4 and not much on PC (I couldn't wait for the PC release so bought a PS4 specifically for this game). This is the game we have all been waiting for after playing Monster Hunter 2 on PS2 which I rented from a DVD store back years and years ago I have always wanted Capcom to deliver a fully fledged HD Monster Hunter and boy did they ever. After years and years of mixed quality portable games for PSP/Nintendo 3DS and not listening to the Western audience Capcom went full HAM on this game and produced a masterpiece. The core gameplay is the same yet every single aspect of the game has improved. The ammount of simple quality of life improvements in this from previous Monster Hunter titles was perfect and welcomed a huge influx of new Western players. I am so happy for the success that Capcom has recieved from this game and am excited for the expansions coming in 2019. I hope they keep adding and expanding on this wonderfly beatifully made game. Give this a go you won't regret it (they plan to release a free trial versions soon so keep your eyes peeled). &lt 3 &lt 3 &lt 3,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

Played the PS4 Version before playing this version. Started with MH3 preferred 4 Ultimate before this one (Underwater Combat was great on paper but terrible in practice).TLDR The game I play when I wake up in the morning and think ""I want to feel like a dude wearing the remains of a giant monster that failed to tear my face off.""Monster Hunter World is the initial installment of the 5th Generation of the Mainline Series of Monter Hunter games. More important it is the first Mainline installment that has been on what Capcom has described as more powerful hardware compared to the handheld installments which previous games have been on.Building on the slightly more story focused Monster Hunter 4/ 4 Ultimate World has a more considerable focus on a main story to give players a reason as to why they're out hunting these large monsters that roam the land. This time you're a Hunter who is part of the Fifth Fleet of the Research Commission sent out to aid them in their investigation of a phenomenon known as the Elder Crossing. One thing leads to another and you find yourself hunting large monsters with your choice of 14 weapons alongside your Palico companion. Don't expect a story on par with Shakespeare or Tolkien but it still serves as a decent reason as to why you're out in the middle of a new continent trying to kill a lightning unicorn so you can turn what's left of it into a tube top and a loincloth before you turn it's horn into a sword.Gameplay is along the lines of an Action RPG where you roam around hunting monsters collecting items and exploring areas. You have a choice of 14 weapons to choose from with a wide variety of moves and abilities along with a wide selection of armor. While the most basic of both weapons and armor can be bought in the game the majority of your equipment will come from the items collected from the areas you explore and the monsters you hunt. The quests that pit you against large monsters around the continent follow a straightforward difficulty curve with a few monsters and quests spread throughout that serve as potential barriers to test everything you learned up to that point and your equipment that you have forged throughout the game. It is important to mention that this game can be quite grindy for those who have never played any other Monster Hunter game. There will be points where you may find yourself hunting the same monster multiple times in a row in order to collect items to forge armor and/or weapons.Multiplayer is much different from previous installments no longer is there a divide between single player and multiplayer quests. Additionally a Drop In/Drop Out system has been implemented in the form of the SOS Flares which players can launch in order to call for help from up to 3 other players. Important to note that in quests this comes at the cost of dividing the Zenny from a quest reward by the number of players who arrive to help. However launching an SOS Flare can be a risky endeavor at times due to the fact that all players in a quest share the same pool of limited continues after fainting and there's no way to determine the skill of a player who responds to your flare. So there may be times where you are fighting a powerful monster and launch the flare for help only to have a woefully unprepared hunter arrive and burn through your continues as they immediately faint against the monster time and time again.My main gripe about this is that it does takes away from the Gathering Hall in the Hub Area rendering it a ghost town unless you bring friends or arrive during particular in game events and makes the game feel a bit less social than other installments. Still I do approve of removing the divide between Single Player and Multiplayer Quests and simply adjusting the difficulty based on the players present so it doesn't bar the late and post game content from players who don't feel like being forced to play with other players all the time or latecomers who arrive after the playerbase is mostly gone.Visuals are rather stunning ranging from the landscape to the monsters themselves. This serves as one of the most obvious improvements after transitioning away from handheld systems. Based on the parts and monitor that I mentioned earlier the game runs at a stable 60 FPS and 1440P with no visible issues. For those coming from previous Monster Hunter titles some of the weapon designs do leave a bit to be desired seeing as how they look like the base weapons with some parts from a monster added to it. However armor designs are still just as good as previous titles with a wide variety of appearances.The music from a personal perspective is absolutely amazing with the various pieces properly fitting their locales and situations.The voices sound relatively good and don't have too many instances of overacting with the English VA. For those who want to seem as if they're in another world or just to preserve the dialogue experience from the previous games there is an option to have the characters speak in Monster Hunter Language which sounds good as well. Regardless of your language choice the lip syncing leaves a lot to be desired though.Overall I do recommend this game to anyone who wants to play a relatively straightforward Action RPG where you hunt large monsters in various locales either by yourself or 3 other people. Especially if you don't mind grinding for items or a loop of fighting monsters to get stronger equipment to fight stronger monsters. The story that follows your hunter isn't going to be an epic tale but for what it's worth it isn't bad. Regarding music as of the date that this review was posted the Soundtrack is on sale. If you haven't bought it already you should consider buying it now. It's really that good.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

It's also getting an expansion DLC next year and if you're unaware with how MH does expansions expect a whole new complete campaign new monsters and a new hunter level cap.Overall this is a great game worth the money wether on or off sale and you're garanteed one or two hundred hours of content at the very least.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-14,0,0,226,False,Recommended,Don't understand why the reviews are so mixed. The game is really great. Yes there are connection issues right now. But I'm sure Capcom didn't foresee MHW selling like crazy on PC and the servers buckled under big player counts. They'll get that fixed up though within a week. The PC port isn't the BEST port but it still runs absolutely fine on my mid range PC while still looking great. Again they'll probably update and polish the game some more in the future with updates. So don't let the mixed reviews steer you away. For a AAA game it is a surprisingly deep and complex game with tons of mechanics and variety. There are so many different beasts to hunt armor to forge and collect and weapons to try out. It's a fun grind to get into and a satisfying gameplay loop.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-13,0,0,93,False,Recommended,Monster Hunter World is a very fun game and has a wide variety of different experiences. There are 14 different weapon types and each one has its in's and out's. Using each one has almost a completely different playstyle so you should be able to find something for you. You unfortunately have to grind out the story by yourself and can only do the optional or event hunts with your friends online. The Armor and weapons in this game are amazing to see and the feeling of accomplishment for grinding to finish an armor set is really nice. Overall I highly reccomend this game as it has instantly become one of my favorite games.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2019-01-02,0,0,127,False,Recommended,The game is a lot of fun even if it is pretty grindy. Don't play it with big picture on the steam hud is horrible for that. Networking worked fine for me for the most part rarely have I not connected to someone elses game. All in all it's a good game with tons of hours of play story mode isn't too long i completed it in about 20 hours or so. There's a lot more quests and optional stuff to do as well as weekly events and all the content updates are free. The only thing you have to pay for is dances and costumes for the handler. All in game costumes for your character are free. They added a bunch of monsters for free since it came out Deviljho Kulve Taroth Lunastra and Behemoth. It's more fun coop.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-17,0,0,161,False,Recommended,The game as a single player experience is pretty solid. However the big draw for most people is playing with friends. The constant drops from online play can be pretty frustrating for multiplayer. Even in sigle player you can get pop ups when disconnected that can cause you to ruin a hunt. The performance of the game is not where it should be but if you have a good system you shouldn't have any problems keeping it above 60fps with a few tweaks. There is also currently a bug where the textures are not loading in to the highest resolution which can make the game look less then stellar. Monster hunter world has the underlyings of a good game but the execution leaves a lot to be desired. It doesn't help when Capcom is silent about most of the problems. If you just want to play single player I could probably recommend the game to you. If you intend to play with others I would wait to see if they at least fix the multiplayer first. Single player the game is about a 7 or 8 but multiplayer is about a 4 or 5. If we see a good patch soon the game could be a solid 8 across the board but right now I would wait and see.EDIT Most if not all of the issues that were present at launch have been fixed up. Since then I have put well over 100 hours into the game. I find the grind for decorations a bit extream but overall the game is a very enjoyable experience. Since the multiplayer issus have been fixed the game has become my goto game. I wish they would clearly state that visual mods are 100% ok but I can understand why they dont.

2018-11-23,0,0,215,False,Recommended,"Monster Hunter World is easily one of the best gaming experiences I have had this year.The graphics are fantastic the gameplay is frantic yet precise and the controls perfect... for a controller anyway.The graphics customisation options were good when it released and each major patch is adding new options like the ability remove depth of field or motion blur and many others. The control customisation also gets additions every patch which makes the keyboard and mouse controls less clunky as they are able to be tweaked in many indipendant situations.While the game was plagued with a miriad of connection issues at launch these seem to have been completely eliminated for me. Any issues that most people get are during connection to multiplayer quests which gives an unhelpful error is when the game is full and they joined too late.The only real downside is that in order to play with friends through the Assignment quests the ""story mode"" you will have to watch all cutscenes before your friend can join. If you are in the same online session as your friend this is as simple as joining the quest when they get the message that SOS flares can be used. While clunky it does work.A second downside if you are this way inclined is that many of the weapon models tend to repeat a small number of base models with only minor flairs to let you know they are different. While the weapons were vastly different in earlier Monster Hunter iterations they were able to pretty much carry their work over from one game to another. For this iteration all the models have had to be recrreated from scratch which does explain the lack of variety but some hunters may feel a little let down by this.Overall the experience i have had with Monster Hunter World has been a very pleasant one full of fighting dangerous monsters to turn them into my precious weapons and armour.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-09,0,0,36,False,Recommended,Product received for free. EDIT The game is playable in multiplayer as of late and works without interrupts so changed the review from negative to positive. After few play sessions it's a fun game to play and learn but it truly shines only while playing with friends. Online multiplayer is so broken at the moment that I can't recommend it until they fix it to work longer than 2 minutes at a time.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-10,0,0,38,False,Not Recommended,The game is a LOOP. Once you have kill a monster you have pretty much done everything there is to do. If you focus on the gameplay you can get bored fast as the combat feels slows it's one move after the other and you can go get a tea before your character's done with that strike. However maps and fauna are great it's lush it's vivid and the monsters look cool. The multiplayer system sucks you play with unknown people who never use their mic and only meet them for the time of a mission as most of them drop the team as soon as they are done. It's feels very empty knowing that this is a multiplayer game and no real end goal. Why can't we all be playing on the same servers? I don't get why they just don't do a lobby?! Console games suck. For what I have paid I will insist on the game but so far after the great first impressions and almost 40 hours in I do not see Monster Hunter in my gaming pantheon and I really expected something grandiose. Look I like gameplay and I am not impressed at all by the combat system it's not a hard game it's a GRINDING GAME. Maybe it's just a niche game and it's not my style but I can reckon the efforts put in this game it's still an excellent production.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

Game offers alot of weapons to master all of which i found to be enjoyable. The progression of making and farming sets is enjoyable and all the more when completed and field tested. A must have for fans of the series. The hunts at first felt lacking (used to MHFU and Dark Souls) but new end game contents are quite the step up. Nonetheless the fights were fun.

2019-01-02,0,0,106,False,Recommended,Okay this is my first review and probably one of my last reviews. I intend to review only the games that really give me that warm fuzzy feeling in my chest. This is a Game that does that. This is gotta be my favourite games ever made. I wanted to play this when it came out but I was stuck with a laptop with no graphics card. (now I got a desktop with a 1050 if you where wondering)I love the Monster hunter series since i played Monster hunter 3 and went up from there.And I think this is the best Monster Hunter. I am a sucker for graphics but the game plays almost the same as all the other games andvthe things that have changed where changed in a positive way.The game only has some trouble explaining some of the deeper elements there are to monster hunter world.

2019-01-01,0,0,157,False,Recommended,"I waited patiently for this game to release for PC and my wait was completely rewarded. When I jump off a cliff I still occassionally get squimish and think ""oh crap I'm dead"" because of how immersive the environments are. It's stunning graphics. I do play with a controller and recommend using a controller for this game. It's still too difficult to control with a keyboard and mouse imo. Once you figure out a weapon that works for your playstyle and get a handle on the controls it's a blast. It's always a thrill to be fighting the pink T rex and to get blindsided by the big Iguana. The first time that happened I laughed so hard. You never know what's going to happen on your hunts. It's a different experience each time and depending on if you play solo or with other players it also affects your gameplay. It's really fun to jump into someone else's game to respond to their SOS and help them beat that really tough lightning unicorn matchup or just collect shrooms. Very versatile. Events are awesome too.

2018-12-30,0,0,157,False,Recommended,Now my stance on MHW is mixed really but I'm giving a positive rating because I did genuinely have fun despite the several quirks I have about this game which ultimately led to my overall disappointment.Before I start however I must mention that MHW has a absoutely mediocre story and bland characters. THIS IS HOW NOT TO EXECUTE A STORY. It's a shame because the animators are clearly talented yet are restricted by poor writing.For the main bulk of the game hunting the boss monsters are well executed and satisfying bringing in tons of interesting mechanics such as tracking breaking limbs tail dismemberment mounting turf wars monster habitat behaviour not to mention the wide variety of builds and weapons to choose from. Honestly I found this overall to have a steeper learning curve than the Dark Souls series.Unfortunately the difficulty can feel very artificial and straight up unfair on many occasions especially once you traverse into the late to end game where monsters are able to effectively to stunlock you through combos most annoyingly through Roars and Ground Tremors. This gets even worse on Special Assignments where they have blindingly fast attack speed (Behemoth) unavoidable stuns (Lunastra) or overly large hitboxes (Deviljho). This game is not intended to be fair you will very often face unfair monster design and must empIoy appropriate strategies in return. I did not feel any remorse using cheesing strategies such as kiting monsters to force Turf Wars or using the Bow to get easy hits. Think about this point carefully before you finalise your decision on buying this game.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-21,0,0,94,False,Recommended,I feel like Capcom has done a OK job at adressing the problems of MHW there is still some disconnect but not even close to the problems that i had when first playing the game on release. Super fun game!,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-13,0,0,278,False,Recommended,"Short version You hunt monsters (like you couldn't tell from name of this game). You can play this as solo or with friends you decide. Some battles can be showy. Good graphics need better PC than minecraft PC.Long version Release was awful servers were so bad that only thing you saw was ""Error 50382 MW1"" which you still might see but not that often. After 200h I can say that yes this is worthy game......tho the first 100h was me trying to get online without success when this game was released so basically after 100h. Anyways I were new to Monster Hunter series until now. Graphics are nice only thing bothering me is horrible lip sync but good cutscenes will make up for it. I was expecting clunky controls but they are actually really good with controller. I used to play with mouse and keyboard but noticed how much easier it was for me to play with controller.Main quests are usually tracking monster then killing or capturing it. There are other quests too which are easier like gathering stuff and hunting mosquitos etc.You can hunt some monsters in arenas which is easier when they can't leave or which position.Loot system is random(ish). For example you need a tail from certain monster. You get it if you manage to cut it off on the fight but if you need like a hide from certain monster there is about 30% chance to get it since you can get other body parts aswell. Only thing which I like the most is that every hunt last from 10 to 20 minutes. This game is really time consuming. I usually go with this saying that ""When game offers you 1h/1 game time it's a good game. This is a good game which had horrible launch......but all good now.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-11-23,0,0,308,False,Recommended,Very addicting game. Playing the franchise since day one. Only downside on the PC version is the lack of content. Ca$com holds back updates and gives them to consoles first. If we get the update eventualy then they adjust the loottable so you are forced to grind the event next time again only to farm the stuff you really wanted.Apart from that the game is pretty solid lots of grinding (it's MH duh!). No toxic MP.Hope to see better updates cycles for new content in the future.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-16,0,0,91,False,Recommended,This game is awesome and I'm having a lot of fun despite its flaws.I wish I could recommend it but the online has been completely broken since launch and its just getting sad at this point. Constant disconnects I rarely can complete a single mission without getting dropped. Even single player gets interrupted with error messages. This wouldn't always be a dealbreaker in some games but multiplayer is EVERYWHERE it even makes you change/start a server just to play single player. There's no excuse for it to work so poorly if you're going to push it this hard. I expect better performance in a game where MP is just an afterthought.Capcom fix your and I'll thumbs up with pleasure otherwise I'm going to keep telling people to stay away.Alright seems like it works okay now. Still leaving my rant because it sucked during the 40 hours I played it broken.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-12-30,0,0,359,False,Recommended,"Be patient. If something seems you are likely doing it wrong. Keep trying to figure it out and it will become easier and more enjoyable. Example Transfering items from your pouch to your item box can seem extremely tedious and dumb until you figure out pressing ""E"" transfers a whole stack. Greatly reducing the number of clicks required. So as stated it's prolly just you being new. Keep at it.Things to do.Upgrade armor and weapons.Upgrade your Palico's (cat friend) armor and weapons.Capture small pets to let loose in your bedroom.Hunt huge hulking monsters.Get hunted by huge hulking monsters.Hide from huge hulking monsters.Watch huge hulking monsters fight and kill eachother.Creep around where you just watched said fight and pick up scales/feathers/broken bits. Use said broken bits to upgrade your armor and weapons.Have a cat cook food for you.Fly climb jump slide swim.Mine dig up bone piles/corpses tear down spider webs.Shoot small animals out of the sky.Fight bugs.Collect bugs.Drop a variety of traps that have a variety of effects.Try to hide from a giant T Rex lookin thing only to have it sniff you out and destroy your hiding place to murder you and your grandchildren.Much Much More. I only just started and I love it.On a more realistic note. It's mostly open world there are obvious boundries and you can only climb things you are allowed to climb. The map is layered. So the map is actually 3 7 times bigger than when it initially looks like.The ""monsters"" interact with one another chasing fighting killing. You often get caught up in the carnage.You can track all the monsters on the map so your job is to keep an eye on the big bad bosses while roaming around completing your missions. These eventually result in you fighting the big baddies which are long fun painful fights.A typical boss fight will take you 10 15 minutes as a two person team.You can team up with friends it's complicated but when you figure out how it works it becomes EZ.You can free roam with a friend. Expiditions are endless running about killing/fighting. Bosses respawn mobs respawn all things respawn. It's just a big grind fest (for as long as you want). All this can be complimented by doing optional/bounties that reward you with items/points/money.Or you can progress the story line by doing story related quests.Absolutely recommend this. The only complaint I have is that my PC sucks and I have to play it on potato settings. And the multi played can be a bit challenging for a new players.DON'T GIVE UP! If it seems hard or too complicated you are likely doing it wrong! Me and the wife struggled through the first few hours (having fun) but unsure how it all worked. The early story lines will help you figure out alot of it take your time and READ try all the options it becomes clear eventually.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-12-26,0,0,184,False,Recommended,"I've been a big fan of the Monster Hunter series ever since ""Monster Hunter Freedom Unite"" and I'm not disappointed by this game either. To sum the game up you hunt monsters in a fantasy world but unlike other games Monster Hunter tries to build a resonable even if sometimes special ecosystem you really feel like in a living breathing environment. But what are differences to it's predecessors? Well for a start it is the first game of Monster Hunter in which you can play with other hunters from all over the world instead of being restricted to one continent hence the name ""MONSTER HUNTER WORLD"". Although at first glance it may look like a complete makeover it still feels like any other Monster Hunter game. Of course there are obvious differences such as the new gadgets (mantles slinger) the new quest layout (no more key quests) and of course the voice acting (which can be disabled in the options menu) but there really aren't many changes to the gameplay except maybe the new weapon combos. What I really like about the game is the effort that has been put into the environment to make it not only look realistic but also make it more dynamic with slopes to slide down and natural traps for monsters. The only downsite I can think of is the rather small monster roster instead of numbers up to 98 there now are only 53 monsters in the game because unlike in previous games the developers couldn't just reuse models and animations they had to make everything from scratch. I definitely recommend buying this game even if it seems like a game that gets boring very quickly there are hours upon hours of fun to be had especially if you play with friends ) .",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

As a long time fan there is one thing in this game that bother me it feels like it holds your hand a little more than in the past which is kind of lame.There are somethings I really love though. Quality of life changes mostly. The farm is really easy and intuitive and gives you more than ever so you can spend more time hunting than gathering.

Can't wait for more.Original review I mean I love Monster Hunter. I put a ton of time into this game on PS4. I was beyond excited to jump back in on PC. That said this is not a good port. I think it can be but right now I can not with good conscience recommend it. The glut of multiplayer errors broken settings poor performance and well lack of content compared to the PS4 version are just not great selling points.One of the worst sticking points for me right now about this game in general is that it still requires every party member to have seen all cutscenes before they can proceed together.

Combat in general plays a lot more methodically sure but to telegraph every strike and POSE after a combo is frankly ridiculous. Monster hitboxes are generally okay but seem to break down when they're special event type of monsters. Special event monsters are ""fun"" but be ready for a fair amount of t hits.

The grind aspects are still very fun and it's hard to say that for some games. I would definitely recommend playing this with a controller. I hear mouse/keyboard support has gotten better since release but I still think a controller gives the best experience. Connectivity issues have also improved since release. I've only disconnected from a battle once (for reasons other than my internet) out of over a hundred. The steady stream of new content in the form of new monsters and collab events is also nice and keeps me coming back. Overall very fun game I definitely recommend!,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2019-01-01,0,0,171,False,Recommended,PUT THE GAME ON AN SSD Starting with Monster Hunter Freedom Unite on the PSP I've always been a fan of Monster Hunter games. Back then I wasn't really able to do much since the game can be pretty tough if you don't know what you're doing (this holds up in Monster Hunter World) but part of the fun I had back then was in the more casual exploration areas of the game seeing big Woolly mammoths (the Popo) running around the first snowwy mountain map trying to learn the layout finding gathering spots so I could actually make items that I needed since the game wasn't going easy on me and my young brain. When it came to actually hunting a monster I had to learn all the specific weaknesses Not just types but about the fact that you can use a sonic bomb on the Cephadrome to make it resurface on my own because back then I didn't know where to look online for useful information.Monster Hunter World takes these things that I loved doing and makes them so much more rewarding. If you've mastered a map or a monster it shows! You can easily find gathering nodes that you're looking for you can easily tell what type of damage is more effective on certain monsters if you want to know if a monster has a tail that's severable so that you know going into the hunt to cut it off the game will give you that information all you have to do is explore the amazingly designed enviroments that the Monster Hunter Dev Team have made.Going from Monster Hunter 3 to Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate was a dificult decision due to the system downgrade (From the Wii U to the 3DS) but overall the quality of the game persisted and the experience of MH4U was phenomenal. So when I was thinking of going from MH4U to Monster Hunter World the choice was a nobrainer because not only was the platform better but the quality that you could see just from trailers and teasers and other promo content for the game was so high I couldn't not pick up a copy on PS4.When I heard that this game was not only going to be on major consoles but it was getting a PC port as well I was blown away. Now fast forward a couple months after the console release to the PC release and the game has some problems. Chiefly among those problems (as of launch) Poor online connectivityPoor co op functionalityPoor optimisationPoor M+KB controlsSince then the Dev Team have ironed out a lot of these issues. Most have been improved others I'm not sure.I personally haven't been dropped from an online lobby in what feels like months This one is still not great story quests afaik still can't be played co op until all members have watched the cutsceneThe game runs quite well for me (60fps on med/high) with a mid range setup (1050ti i7 3770kM+KB controls have been updated and improved although I prefer using a controller for Monster Hunter games so I can't speak for if they've been changed for the betterThis game has received a lot of quality of life updates that fix a lot of peoples initial problems with the game and because of that I can't recommened this game enough it is personally my favourite game of 2018 hands down. TL DR The game has been updated to fix a lot of the problems with the initial negative reviews the recent reviews reflect this accurately.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2019-01-01,0,0,206,False,Recommended,Everyone seems to be complaining about the fact that this is geared more for controller play. True monster hunter has always been a controller based game...That being said i play this with keyboard and mouse and it feels perfectly fine to me. People need to realize that you need to change your play style dependent on the game. I did this for dark souls 3 too. You need to change gears in how you think mouse and keyboard games should work. It's pretty straight forward once you can get your mind out of the box.I do however agree that optimization can be bad in certain areas. Fighting Teostra is always a laggy and frame dropping mess for me. But that's 1 fight out of the many that I perfectly enjoy.Great game recommend it if you like boss fights.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-09-14,0,0,415,False,Recommended,After a sketchy PC launch this game is now a well established skill based RPG with a lot of great combat mechanics that Dark Souls players will find easy to pick up on and a very enjoyable flowing combat system. A highly enjoyable experience lots of longevity to the game with some really awesome (somewhat antagonistic I'm looking at you Deviljho and Bazelgeuse!) boss like monsters to beat up and either capture or slay. End game feels a bit stale at the moment only due to the trend of G rank Elders just being 'harder stronger faster' and nothing else but it still gives more than it's moneys worth in return.Just as a note to the developer Lunastra is not a fun enemy this is very poorly designed in comaprison to every other creature in this game.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

Monster Hunter is a series that gives me a lot of joy and being able to play it with friends is a consistent joy. My friend got this game for me several months ago so I should probably mark this review as getting it for free but I don't think it applies to me. Anyway I really love this game it'd be cool to see more crossover content in future. Especially if its final fantasy themed.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-12-23,0,0,31,False,Recommended,Monster Hunter World is both an entry point in the series for an audience who have only ever heard of the monter slaying slasher and a remake of the formula for an age old series that has fans of both the west and east joining together to explore the new world.As a long time fan of the series I was both excited and cautious of this instillation in the series due to its major change in both platform and gameplay. The open world aspect of each map seemed like both a dream and curse as I explored new rich environments and quickly learnt that the vastness could be my downfall in a fight. Although the new maps and world as a whole are a challenging change in mechanics and strategy the beauty of a small enclosed beach or a view over a vast lush forest can leave you lost for words during a difficult hunt.The veriety in weapons hasn't changed since the last title however the way that weapons are presented has changed considerably. Each weapon being in your box from the start like in every start to a MH Game but the practice area allows for in depth training that can make a world of difference when learning a new weapons style. As this is a new world that also means new monsters which will also lead to a new array of weapon and armor match ups all of which in the later game can be mixed to boost specififc stats and allow you to hunt to your full potential.The multiplayer is also heavily sold for hunts in both the story and in the Gathering hub for more advanced hunters allowing you to team up with friends or just friendly hunters to get through a hunt with ease. This doesn't however limit the solo experience as the difficulty level will increase with every added hunter leaving no solo hunter at a disadvantage to a monster should they choose to go it alone.In conclusion Monster Hunter World is a sensational step forward for the franchise showing advanced graphics on both console and PC and a system that can be sustained through teams or solo artists to achieve the very best results in a hunt. The game is gripping from A Z and although there can be some slow slopes to the story during investigation sections these all link to a greater mission that will prove to be a challenge to any capable hunter.10/10 would put far too much of my free time into this game again.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-12-23,0,0,60,False,Recommended,biggest pros for me smooth combat. everything you'd want to do to feel like a badass monster slayer is available to you in some way or another huge variety of combat styles i haven't even scratched the surface but everything seems a valid method from what i've seen other people using the design for the gear and monsters is incredible progression that makes sense (story and gear wise) and sorta strings you along into wanting to see and earn more cool shiz online aspects make this worth buying rather than pirating. it feels just social enough offline play is a just little lonely after you've become accustomed to online. it feels a little like Dark Souls' online function but without PVP and a bit more accessiblecons apparently turns into a grindfest? from what i've heard rather than experienced. but if the grinding is fighting heck off huge monsters with the aforementioned combat i'd say this is hard pressed to be a con at all im not accustomed to non fully voiced RPGs. i think MH W is basically a JRPG though? the parts where there is voice acting is at times a little jarring but i've come to terms with it some mods are needed for improved Quality of Life such as light columns for monster dropped materials. if you have a PS4 controller you might have to live without any vibration too price visit Reddit's Steam trading groups to get this between 20 and 30 USDhappy hunting!,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-12-20,0,0,150,False,Recommended,"I love this game but I am a long time Monster Hunter fan so my opinion is biased. I've done 100% of available missions on PS4 and on PC for this game and still just have fun going out and killing stuff for the heck of it or to try and make a deadly clownsuit. A few things to consider before you buy The game's difficulty is based around being slow this is not really a fast paced game. It's more about predicting what the monster is going to do and acting accordingly and striking when you have an opening. This game is about grinding a large part of this game is killing the same monsters over and over to get materials to make gear some materials are very rare and may require killing the monster multiple times. This game can be frustrating. Very very frustrating. It's something that you may start off sucking at but you can breeze through monsters once you get the hang of it. Don't be afraid to look up guides and suggestions from other players. Yes the story is awful. It's a tacked on feature that the older games did not really have outside of a few dialogues and ""boss"" battles. You can't skip cutscenes and it sucks. There might be mods that can fix this but use at your own risk since the game does not support modding. I know that the list may seem like a bunch of negatives but it's honestly a solid super fun game and the most fluid and best starting points for new hunters in the series.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-12-31,0,0,51,False,Recommended,"Played over 200 hours on PS4. Just started a new character on PC and I can say they did an awesome job porting this game! I did have to change some keybinding to make play more comfortable for mouse and keyboard (see AREKKZ GAMING's control remapping video on YouTube for details). Once I got the controls to my liking this game feels great to play on PC. Graphics are top notch on my big gaming rig and even serviceable when turned to ""Low"" settings on my laptop. Loading times are much faster than its PS4 counterpart even without using a SSD in my laptop. The story can be hit or miss and the Handler is annoying as F. But Monster Hunter was never praised for its storytelling and this game at least tries to have a cohesive narrative sewn within its boss battle focus on gameplay.Many negative reviews are from people that haven't really given the game's mechanics and vast control options a chance. When Western audiences think of ""Action RPGs"" they think of Devil May Cry God of War or Diablo. This is a different kind of Action RPG. It's a HUNTING RPG. The focus here is on tracking giant monsters while you gather flora and fauna that will help you in your hunts. Once you locate the beast combat becomes a VERY LONG WINDED dance between you and it. If you have the patience the payoff when a giant monster finally goes down can be exhilarating.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-11-21,0,0,683,False,Recommended,Monster Hunter for casuals. Still a good game but is missing much of the charm of previous games. New players will likely enjoy it but vets will find it lacking. Weapon and armor designs are bland compared to past games. There are 31 unique large monsters. I consider it to be easier than Dark Souls 3 but harder than most games. I'd reccomend buying on sale or wait for a Iceborne if you're on a really tight budget.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

This is not to say that the game does not have any problems it does. When people talk they speak the first 4 words and then they stop but their lips keep on moving and it takes the game a step down. Also the listed recomended system requierments are a bit off. I have a core i5 4460 3 2Ghz and a MSI GTX 1060 6gb and I am running it on high with medium AA and low shadows and i get between 45 65 fps so if you want 60fps all the time you might want to lower the settings a bit more.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-12-29,0,0,87,False,Recommended,Writing my first review for a game ever on steam that's how good this game is. Note the review is probably going to be somewhat all over the place and not very well structured but here it is. This is actually the first game I've played that I'd say is absolutely worth the money (not counting single player games). Amazing environment mechanics monsters and the amount of weapons that you can use. There's always something that you can do in this game be it a day where you want to chill and just go to collect some materials on an expedition (like ores different herbs meat fish pets etc.) or just spend your whole day on investigations optional quests and hunts in general or even helping out other people by responding to SOS flares. Considering all the armour sets and upgrades for the weapons you always have something to strive for. Just changing one of your weapons brings a whole new experience to the game. I especially like the fact that the game doesn't really hold your hand completely through the playthrough. Feels somewhat similar to the Dark Souls series which is a big plus for me. It does teach you the basics and let's you explore the rest of the possibilities in the game (ex. the combos for the weapons shows you the basic ones but not all possible moves the weapon can perform). There are some problems with the game but I wouldn't say they are too major considering all the other AAA title games that are around the same price range as this one and are complete garbage compared to this game. Mentioning this here as I can see there are a lot of negative reviews for somewhat ridiculous issues which can be resolved (and the devs are working on fixing as well from what I can see in the past almost 1 year of updates). Regarding the co op side of the game. It is a bit weird in the beginning but once you figure it our it's not bad at all. At the time of writing this I have only 63 hours played but man they have been the best 63 hours I have spent in a game in a really long time. So I'd say that this game is completely worth checking out and giving it a chance regardless of the mixed reviews that can be seen. Go ahead and buy it and build your own opinion for this game.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-12-31,0,0,476,False,Recommended,If you enjoy action games then get this game! Worth it at $60 or more.I like this game so much that I am upgrading my graphics card for it to run better.For me the biggest reason why gamers should buy this is it is the kind of consumer wallet friendly product that developers are moving away from. It doesn't have loot boxes just paid DLC for specific not random cosmetic changes and gestures. The developers keep adding content for free and the expansion that's coming in 2019 isn't going to be sold as an all new game like they had to in the handheld versions.This is not my first monster hunter game experience. I have played some of the PSP and 3DS games but never got that far in any of them. I have reached end game (Arch Tempered Monsters) for two characters in this one. For those that have tried the handheld monster hunters this game includes a variety of Quality of Life (QoL) enhancements that makes prepping for a hunt require less management. The graphics are stunning in comparison as well.You play a hunter joining an expedition into a new continent. NPCs are other hunters researchers and support staff for the expedition. The story is pretty mediocre and not that much happens to the other characters. Your job is to explore gather and hunt. Your tools include a wide variety of close combat and ranged weapons with their own unique move sets a slingshot/grappling hook potions and capes with special abilities. The levels are large multi leveled and full of life. In those levels there are small animals to capture fish to catch plants to gather slingshot ammo to equip environmental traps to trigger environmental hazards to avoid or compensate for shortcuts allies to find rocks to mine bones to pick through ramps to slide down various places you can grappling hook to small monsters you can interact with in a variety of ways and of course the BIG monsters who you have extended fights with often over several sections of the map. Monsters respond to other monsters falling rocks flashes of light fire your blade against their hide and more. They eat they sneeze they sleep they get bored they burrow and they scratch. The monsters you hunt are the most interesting part of the game. Now how does the game make you want to keep hunting them even after you have killed or captured them all several times? Loot. Loot that can be crafted into armors charms and weapons that are extra effective against various monsters.You can call for help from other human players and you can help them in their own quests. It is very fun taking down monsters as a group and I recommend joining other people's quests when you can. I do recommend that you learn how to take monsters on solo especially on your story missions.To do more damage with a weapon you don't spend points you just get better at the game. To dodge attacks more easily you learn the timing. To survive longer you have to make and use the consumables at your disposal. You the player are the one leveling up. It is very satisfying to be able to beat monsters with the same gear you were wearing when you were struggling against them earlier.The different weapons allow you to hunt your way. Fast and aggressive? Heavy and crushing? Ranged? Each have a few choices to pick from that all feel different. The game does not teach you everything about the movesets. I recommend watching Youtube tutorials to learn. This is the other aspect of the game that lends itself to immense hours of play. You can switch weapon types and experience a very different playstyle. Good if you're getting a little bored.It is perfectly fine to take breaks from this game! I just recommend that you try to play more during the special events like the ones they have for Halloween and Winter so far. People after 300 hours or so of gameplay start complaining about a lack of things to do. That's reasonable!Happy Hunting!,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-12,0,0,140,False,Recommended,The game is much better now disconnects are incredibly infrequent and crashes never happen. there is however inconsistent loot drops items requiring a lot more than others to craft despite being the same teir and low tier high rank armor becoming uselsess.

2019-01-02,0,0,197,False,Recommended,Game works well and online is stable. I've never played a monster hunter game before this one but it was easy to pick up and learn. All the different types of weapons feel different and there is no bad choice for a weapon type. My only gripe worth mentioning is that this version is significantly behind the console version thanks to a later release date. If that doesn't bother you though definitely worth giving this a shot.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-12-31,0,0,112,False,Recommended,"Clocked 50hrs in my first four days of playing and I feel like I might be halfway to where I want to be if not less. This game is beautiful it flows so goddamn well in terms of movement and the grind is fairly enjoyable.One thing I want to mention though I don't know if this is a popular problem is that it balances progress with a stagnant grind You research monsters and then have to kill them several times over to get enough materials to make armor and weapons (sometimes me than several times). You can just leap monster to monster but at some point you will have to stall your progress and really double down on grabbing some fresh gear. You can do this at any time but it means that you likely won't be grabbing every single armor set without putting down lots of time for things that will be technically outclassed by the time you research a few more monsters. On the upside it means that you can choose when and where you want to grind unless you're stuck on a monster.I am constantly amazed by how good this game looks. I'm a big proponent of Fashion Souls using whatever armor looks the best and this game absolutely delivers. Every single armor set looks wonderful and the weapons are insanely good.To add there are certain Western game tropes that are altogether absent from this game and Japanese themes reminiscient of Earth Defense Force and Yakuza. The result is something very fresh on the market if you don't normally play ""eastern"" games.Lastly the feeling of accomplishment is unreal.

The game doesn't run miraculously better than it did from launch but in hindsight I was probably crazy to expect this game to ever reach 100+ FPS anyways.Regarding any hiccups in things like stutters due to certain effects and some control issues for M+KB users those were addressed as well. While it would have been GREAT if some of these things were addressed BEFORE launch part of me can be forgiving that this dev team who have probably never worked on a PC Game before this was able to address user concerns and issues in a manner more timely than Square Enix's handling of Nier Automata.And regarding gameplay it's just good fun Monster Hunter. It does what it does well and I wouldn't have personally spent the hundred hours I have into this game if it wasn't any fun. It has some changes and bits of streamlining from the handhelds and stuff but then this is the game where the team is really trying to take advantage of more powerful and modern hardware.All in all yeah I totally recommend this game.

2018-12-25,0,0,105,False,Recommended,"Got this recently after being underwhelmed at console launch (played on PS4).52 hours in I've blown past where I stopped on console after putting in over 70 hours (I try to maintain a dollar hour use ratio even if it isn't the most enjoyable. I've watched movies at the theater for more per hour so if I can enjoy at least 60 hours in one way or another I feel I generally got my money's worth)I don't understand the hate some have for the pc controls I haven't messed about too much with the controls beyond changing the radial menu to be KB+M bar style instead of radial and it works great for me. The connection issues seem to be fixed at least from what I experienced on console in my 52 hours of play I've had maybe three disconnects and it was within the same game session so I tend to think it was probably something on my end given the timing of them (Wavecable later that day had a full outage even)The gameplay is great. While I can't manage the 2K that I would love to play this at with my current GPU I can handle a steady 60 70 FPS at 1080 using reshade to sharpen up and make the colors a little more vibrant. The FPS isn't as important but it does make fights with some of the higher mobility monsters a bit easier to track and besides if you aren't chasing those frame rates with your rig you're doing something wrong. Monsters are varied and the difficulty curve leading into HR and beyond isn't steep to the point of punishing. Yes you'll grind in this game but honestly thats what a game like this is entirely built up around. There's a good sized group of basic monsters (round about 15) that you hunt repeatedly as you progress the story and hunt for materials to build gear and then the game comes into it's own as you start hunting variants and the ""elder dragons"" which are more or less the real challenge in the game. There's new monsters being added periodically and a G rank coming later next year which is a whole 'nother level of difficulty and gear to grind for.Each weapon system is varied enough that it gives a different feel to the game (my 52 hours has been solely the charge blade because I'm a sucker for technical gameplay but I plan on eventually going through and playing with all the rest) allowing you to really change up your experience as you try new things. If that isn't enough there's also the Arena mode which forces you to use specific weaponsets in a hunt and rewards tokens used to craft new gear available only through the Arena. Did I also mention crafting? Holy **** this game is system upon system allowing you to min/max to your heart's desire or just go with the general flow and not have that really be an impediment on your experience until the third or fourth act of the story.Now if you want a quick linear story feel disgust at the idea of learning the terrain of each hunting ground or despair at the thought of spending hours upon hours hunting a specific monster in order to break a certain body part in hopes that RNG smiles upon you to give you a Jagras marrow (Not that that happened. I'm ok.) so that you can then craft the weapon you want to use in your hunt of an even more powerful monster than I hate to say it but this probably not the game for you.But if the idea of losing yourself in an extremely immersive monster hunting sim where you can do just about whatever the hell you want is something you find appealing then absolutely this is the game for you",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-11-20,0,0,395,False,Recommended,"Tldr Due to recent Updates i would recommend buying the Game. The PC version seems to be finally catching up with the Consoles. The combat is fun and if you enjoy playing with friends or even randoms this game might just be perfect for you. First of all I d like to mention that I am a huge fan of the Monster Hunter Series. I started playing when MH Tri came out and I picked up every game ever since. Monsters like Gore Magdala or Zinorge will always have a special place in my heart and I was devasted when I heard that Capcom will not add these to MHW. On the one side I really like the new released monsters but on the other I need to mention that MHW lacks monsters. There currently are 28! (Console 31) different monsters. Four of these (Rathlos Rathian Azure Rathlos and Pink Rathian) are basically the same (Moveset and look differ slightly). Hence I really hope that Capcom will release new Monsters soon because older games MHU games had more than 50 monster.... Luckly there are mods out there which alter many existing monsters into powerhouses. They are really challenging and fun to fight against. https //www.youtube.com/watch?v 3LtNjbuAPAE https //www.youtube.com/watch?v S 7VyF6AjY8Second I really must praise Capcom. The new combat mechanics are amazing. I can really feel the impact when swinging my Swich Axe while slicing Odagaron apart. Even though the game gets repetitive after 40 50h I still enjoy the combat. When you get bored playing the Switch Axe you can easily change to a Hammer or Bow. There are 14 different Weapons which feel and play very well.Third thing I want to mention is that Capcom fixed the Server Issues. Many old reviews state that servers are having connection problems. I have yet to face these problems because they never annoyed me. I played since the first week after launch and I mostly joined SOS flares (join a quest) and up until now i was only disconnected twice from the host.(I have an 20 Mb/s Internet connection)Finally I want to mention I few things that annoy me personally. These is mostly QoL stuff. NPCs are scattered around and i hate walking. I need at least 10 15 second to reach the cantina. NPCs like the ""Farm"" Manager and Smithy are not located in the Gathering Hub. (Multiplayer Hub) It takes a lot of time to open the Quest List I miss the Pause button from older generations I hate Toaster Filter for specific Quest monsters doesn t save last settings which can be quite annoying I had to use a roundabout way to remove Armor Presets (no delete Button) The Gem sorting is awful why are the Equipped Gems at the end of the List and not under the unequipped one?! Did I mention that I hate Toaster and his nova ?These are only minor things but I still hope that these will be fixed very soon.*Excuse my grammar I am no professional *wink*",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2019-01-01,0,0,300,False,Recommended,It needs more work on the server stability also if it's not for the help of the community I can't even play together in a quest with my friend. We tweaked the steam shortcut command a bit and it's working like charm until now.But it's a sign that your game is far from perfect.Now for the gameplay I appreciate the developer for keeping the taste of the early Monster Hunter still intact in this game though I missed how unique the environment of Monster Hunter 2 DOS feels when you got back to Head Quarter and you walk pass by their AI which autonomously making a sound of a Monster Hunterish language even without being interracted with.For the action It has improved SO MUCH aspects from the early Monster Hunter titles. the combat is more liquid than ever. Though I hoped you can somehow change some of the monsters attack's hit boxes such as when nergigante doing a leap/flying attack that it supposed to hit anything that's infront of him and it's somehow made me ashamed that it actually hit me when I try to hit him from behind while he's still facing the wall in the middle of it's attack consquence. I find this happening in early titles too but I have great expectation that this kind of inconvenience (I can consider this as a tremendous hitbox bug) won't be surfaced anymore in this game.I love the UI now. more so because it's on PC so I can chat more easily. the display of health and stamina bar is more neat and I prefer it this way because it gave me a wider range of view. though I hope you can do something about the item display on the bottom right. everytime steam is giving me a notification the whole item shortcut section is covered by it. It's really frustrating and more so in the middle of fighting a monster. please do something about it.as for music well like other game it's good I can't give much opinion on music except the one that makes my ears bleed. so i guess it's all good for now.then there's a problem on the sound. there's time where your attacks hit/landed on the monster and it shown the damage counter. but the sound didn't connect. It's actually bugging me more than I though it would be.for now It's 8/10 game and minus the frequent connection problem it's 7/10.I wouldn't recommend my friend to buy this yet as long the connection problem presist but I recommend anyone who loves grinding to play this on solo but you might get bored once you finished the main story.Edit Capcom has taken action on fixing the sound bugs and the connection seems more and more stable now.Go grab it!,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2019-01-25,0,0,328,False,Recommended,"What to say...I started playing the Monster Hunter serie back on the playstation 2 with the very first one and I stopped after that on the PsP. I never touched any Monster Hunter games after until recently with the new asset knows as Monster Hunter World.To be honest the story was a bit thrilling on some sort but very poor unfortunately. I could say this is one of my big points of my deception. I also had some problems with my connection while I played with other players (or seeing the dead freeze lag when someone faints even with a strong computer/laptop) was unparallel when I started playing it. At least they did some fixes.I could say it is also annoying that you do hear the special even music in the Headquarter city when you have a special event that you haven't finished yet is getting annoying. I mean I never finished the Behemoth ""raid"" monster so I constantly have the music of Final fantasy constantly playing until I finish it. I wish there would be an option for that seriously to listen the normal music instead.Yet despite all those problems mentionned above I would say by my experience this Monster Hunter is way much more friendly compared to what I played before. I mean back on Playstation 2 and PsP you didn't have a mini tutorial at the start or a training area to test the weapons properly without taking a quest. You even have some little videos implented for brief explanation for each weapons. Compared to many games I can tell you this is rare to see something to be that friendly toward any kind of players Old MH veterans to new players.And also another thing that I was happy with it is that you don't have anymore ""Loading transitions"" between each area on one map. I mean when you do wanted to go like from Area #1 to Area #2 in the old games you had a loading screen to load that map. It was pretty annoying and long. Now it's a full map with so many interactions in it.And then the combat system surely it got improved compared to my MH serie experience. I did felt those were easier compared to the old ones as they removed lot of clunkyness in the game. Funny as it is and not like the Bowguns weapons because they got some cool things implented with them the warhorn is somehow the less touched of all weapons as being changed over the years during the combat. I really think that the only thing they added is to enter into the music stance right after you can hit an enemy and that damage shockwave.As for my overall review in the end the game has flaws but the gameplay really pushed me hard to enjoy it to play even more. For this year Capcom got a game that is quite decent. It is really a game I would consider to keep an eye on it. I am pretty you will not be disapointed.Oh and Capcom if you read this for the next Monster Hunter please.... do a better written story while keeping your gameplay formula. I know you can do it. Thanks in advance!",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-13,0,0,88,False,Not Recommended,The launch was a bit bumpy and there are still some problems but that is most games. I don't understand why the game is getting so much hate. The problem with this review system is people are far more likely to share their dislike and problems with a product than there are those who are willing to share their satisfaction. Frame rate isn't as good as it should be. I do agree with this but maxed out graphics minus that one setting that was giving everyone problems gets me 80fps which is pretty much constant.The keyboard and mouse keys are bad but at least they are rebindable. Monster hunder has has crappy and i mean crappy keybindings on prior games. The game works just find with a controller and I would recommend one over kb and mouse. for the same reasons i would recommend a controller for darksouls and bloodborne gamesOne can hpe that the claims are true about capcom being open to allow us to mod the game. I would like to see a mod to fix the cat system as well as the multiplay fix. I would like A and B armors to be unique are well as weapons along a branch. I understand the graphics are more work in this than 36sI hope when the stuff is fixed that you who have negatively vote switch your votes around. The game is great.Now that I've played far more I must say the community stuff for this game is so poorly implemented. How could the 3ds with its simple stuff have the tightest of communities and the easiest to interact in. Pain to send messages People don't see messages all the time if not ever. Pain to send and receive guild cards. I forget to send them because its walled in. I think I've only received 2 cards. The other thing is the surprising amount of people who suicide run into monsters and won't listen to anyone.Be nice to have a ranking system based on weighted average of completed missions vs attempted. Each monster would have their weight and then another weight based on method of defeat like cap or kill and number of carts. Time ain't important so long as you win. Then the game can allow you to play within your weight class instead of being thrown in with guys who think this game is a beat em up.I still love this game but it lacks something most monster hunter games and good games in general have even though this game is loads of fun. I can't reccomend this game for a person who loves old style MH because this feels far more laborios for less reward and easier difficulty.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

Most of them complain about connectivity issues that are now almost non existent. If I have to describe the game to someone who never played any title of the saga I'd say that the monster fights resemble the epic Dark Souls boss fights. The end game monsters in particular can be quite tough even with the best gear. And about that there are many pieces of equipment and weapons that lead to different character builds just like in Diablo. Overall it's a good game that can provide many hours of entertainment.

2018-12-28,0,0,170,False,Recommended,"It's pretty much boss fights the game and it's a bit grindy. So if you like the idea of fighting big monsters a lot of times to carve off pieces to make either your weapon better or a better weapon with some tight controls. It offers a lot of depth though and you can always switch weapon types if you're feeling bored or want something else to do or learn. There's 14 of them so take your time finding one you're comfy with. Or learn another later down the line if you so choose.Turn off the ""Volume Rendering Quality"" and you can manually make it go to 60 which seems to be where it's meant to be played. Volume Rendering Quality is in game fog and it makes things look milky and freaks the game out. Seen a lot of that floating around below. Also the menus in here are a bit of a confusing nightmare (But workable after you get the hang of it.) And def. seems to want you to use a controller.But all that aside (do keep it in mind though.) I've had a soft spot for MH since I'd played it with a few friends on my DS a while back so when I heard a port was coming to PC I was hype. Pre ordered after I played it off and on at a friends house on his PS4 to make sure got my settings messed with after looking up a few vids on folks trying to stream it (Pat Stares At has the above setting and what it does it was helpful to get everything up and optimised).To emphasize it is a bit behind consoles as this is this developers first forray into PC. Not a good excuse but something to def. keep in mind. We're getting things caught up still but I'm having a good time running around with friends and even hammering things out solo. It's nice and challenging and like Shadow of the Colossus and Dark Souls you have to kind of figure out the moves of your opponent and most weapons have a grappling action that lets you jump on and take 'em down. I love this odd little albeit grindy game. No micro transactions no fees and an expansion is on the way. Good times.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-09-05,0,0,289,False,Recommended,Awesome game as you'd expect from the saga plus new mechanics and an open world feel to it as the game doesn't load areas singularly but loads the whole level at once. Cool no? Where's the catch then?Optimization. MHW is a port from this generation consoles and the first PC port the team ever made. Well it shows. A PC with an i7 at 4GHZ per core 16 GB DDR4 and a GTX 1080 for graphics has a hard time keeping the 60FPS mark tanking constantly at 50 sometimes 40 in the more detail rich areas like the Rotten Vale it even went down to the hideous console level 30s. Fixes are spread throughout the internet but usually require you to lower your graphical settings which is a pity. I'd like to take this occasion to inform people at Capcom that you're gonna sell even more copies if you can fix this quickly. PC gamers tend to be demanding and considering the overall better equipment at hand with good reason. You already did a great job and have our thanks for bringing this masterpiece to PC but please work on optimization!UPDATE END OF 2018And there they did it! The game is well optimized now and the tedious disconnections are no more. They added lots of content since my last review at the point that they are basically at the same level of the console counterpart and the modding community's been doing huge steps onward to make interesting new challenges.If you still didn't get this game it's a high recommendation from me.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-11,0,0,371,False,Recommended,"MHW is a good entry for newcomers while feeling familiar enough to not alienate veterans of the series.The game features all 14 weapon categories introduced in previous games (main series). With 14 weapon categories 11 being melee 3 being ranged there is enough variety to not be disappointed that MHW didn't introduce a new weapon category. One drop of bitterness is the weapon design though. The weapons don't look bad but they look too similar to each other.In previous games you had one sword that looked like a jaw one that looked like a giant horn another one was covered in serpent skin and released fang like blades when drawn.Now the weapons differ less from each other. The core or base of the weapon mostly stays the same and the only thing that changes is that the blacksmith adds claws skin etc onto the same ""weapon skeleton""That is a huge downer!The new areas look beautiful and the newly added possibilities to interact with the environment and even use it to your advantage is something I've always wished for.The fights are what fans of the series know and love so I'll skip praising stuff that's typical MH. Another good thing about the game is that it has a modding community which is pretty active (Nexus Mods is where you'll find most MHW mods)Cons The story was uncalled for is unskippable (even when creating a second char) has a few tedious missions and hinders the multiplayer experience on which they improved on in this game in that (nearly) every quest can be done in multiplayer now. &gt So there's no seperation between guild and village anymore. You can't play through the sad excuse of a story with a friend that easily though since a lot of progression relevant quests have cutscenes in it. And you can't join someone if you haven't seen the cutscene yourself before and even then you can only join after the host has seen it which is admittedly easy due to the new SOS system (drop in mid quest co op) but still an unnecessary nuisence 99 48 if you want the full game (with the cut out mtx dlc stuff) + OST The game lacks a lot options regarding visuals HUD and more. You can't even pause the game in offline mode. &gt Using the MHW process tool (NexusMods) lets you pause the game. Most errors are fixed but not all. I've lost a character due to a corrupted save after defeating the ""last"" boss (Xeno'jiva) a few days ago.

2018-11-26,0,0,336,False,Recommended,The most beautiful looking Monster Hunter until date. It has a good story that can be completed by your self regardless of your hunting skills and if you need or want help there s always the SOS signal for you to get someone to give you a hand. Moreover the character customization has never been (in previous games) as detailed as it is now. In addition the lack of unnecesary quests in which you have to hunt the same monster over and over again is nice too. In the negative side controls always feel sluggish at some point that s never gonna change apparently. Also it does need more types of monsters to hunt but that is being fixed through DLCs. Awesome game for experienced and beginner hunters. I highly recommend it!,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-11-21,0,0,314,False,Recommended,Product received for free. You've read all the reviews. You know about the disconnect problems denuvo microtransactions whatever fine.So let's get straight to the point.Gameplay is slow and methodical. Boss patterns are many but they are slow. Knowledge and timing are more important than reflexes and intuition in this game. It's mind numblingly easy to run around and dodge all the boss' attacks. Fine.But the risk comes into play when you try to go on the offensive. YOUR attacks are slow too. You are also usually locked into the direction you begin your combo in. Although Monster Hunter World's action gameplay is slow so are you and so battles mostly consist of thinking ahead and deciding just how deeply you want to commit to your combo. Commit too far and you'll get hit during a recovery animation. That's usually the way it goes in this game. Learn your weapon class' ideal DPS combo and use it. Try not to overextend your combo or you'll get dunked on. Play it too safe and your battle will take 20 minutes. And you might die in those 20 minutes. It's yours to decide.There are fast weapons. A few. This is offset by their poor damage. So basically you have to take even bigger risks and take full advantage of boss opening windows to offset the damage cost of using a faster weapon. In the end it's just as risky anyway if you actually want to be useful.And then there are ranged weapons which have even worse damage. So you have to work 4x as hard to carry your weight. Of course the reason for the nerf is self explanatory and logical. Ranged is easy and almost completely risk free. But the damage is ALMOST unsalvageable. Almost. There are ways.Unless you're very experienced and/or very geared most bosses in this game will 3 or 2 shot you. Sometimes even 1 shot depending on how late game or ungeared you are. Monster Hunter World is a somewhat punishing game although not nearly as its predecessors. It is nevertheless not for those looking for a relaxing and carefree experience. At least the game is not intended for that purpose unless you're Mr. America McBadass. Anyway you can find out everything else from other reviews.Good luck!,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2019-01-23,0,0,169,False,Recommended,"It's a Monster Hunter. A quite different one than veterans might expect but it remains a MH at it's core.For those that are fans of the Monster Hunter series there is no need to try and recommend this. You already have it and you like it. For those that haven't touched the series this game will feel weird at first. After a bit of general fidgeting of controls and some trial and error the game can be really great. It highly depends if the typical MH playstyle is something for you. You are mainly fighting ""bosses"" and have something akin to dragged out duels with them. You wear the monster down and try to survive while doing so. At some point you will (hopefully) come out victorious because your enemy couldn't handle the fight anymore and fell victim to the many wounds you created. Approaching a monster without care can easily lead to a quick defeat so the fight never feels boring unless you know the monsters moveset by heart. Even then it's not always easy. If this game sounds fun to you I can only recommend it. The controls might feel weird at first but just rolling with it should do the trick. Just make sure to not cry out in a negative review after the controls don't work ABSOLUTELY perfect in 5 minutes or something feels really bad at first.Looking at the other reviews some people like to try something in 10 minutes and then complain how bad or slow it feels. Half of these reviews state ""problems"" in the game which don't exist just because they didn't even take a look at the game. Imagine someone left a review on Dark Souls saying the game is trash because you can't dodge even though that's a thing you can do from the first second of the game.This game will take getting used to but it's not Runescape or World of Warcraft in which you need atleast a month to get an Idea of the game. You're a new hunter fresh blood. Of course you will need to get used to everything. If this sounds like too much of a Hassle or not your type of game then take a stop here. You will spend your money better in other places. Monster Hunter is not a calm game and you won't be perfect at the game in just a few hours. You might also want see if you have friends to play this game with because just on your own it can easily feel a little empty. Conclusion Veteran? you already have this game and you like it.New? Smashing big monsters and getting better with your weapon of choice. Grab friends for the best experience.Not into boss rush + Gathering and grinding? Maybe just watch the game on Youtube. Might not be your style.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-11-25,0,0,509,False,Recommended,In this day and age while not necessarily perfect the MH dev team are the only team I trust to deliver a quality game every time and the only series I'm willing to preorder new iterations as they release. I have played every Monster Hunter released in the West since Monster Hunter Freedom 2 on the PSP (with the exception of Tri). I bought a 3DS specifically to play more Monster Hunter and to this day I still only own two games for the device MH4U and MHG. Monster Hunter has a gameplay loop that has enthralled me since I first read about it and I didn't even get my hands on any games until a year and half after I first came across it!MHW brings many quality of life improvements to the game while also bringing a roster that is a mix of fresh faces and nostalgic fights. Weapon movesets are reinvigorated and improved so much so that some may even find it hard to return to the previous iterations. And that's important because when the gameplay loop requires you to do effectively the same thing over and over you better hope it's damn good and it is. The feeling of taking down a previously frustrating monster still produces a thrill that many other games struggle to reproduce.The game has a lot of negative press and reviews due to being riddled with issues at launch almost all of which have been fixed at the time of this posting. Don't let them deter you if you are even mildly interested in this game. For the price of entry you have a game that is great solo and better in coop with hundreds of hours of content and even more content released as free DLC. I have sunk many many hours into this game am likely to continue to do so for the foreseeable future.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-11,0,0,125,False,Recommended,Ok before you roast me here's the issue I don't usually write reviews and even then I don't usually write negative reviews because I like leaving positive feedback but after the millionth time seeing my friends and I get kicked from an online session because of the Steam servers I feel like unless we kick up a big enough fuss (It's not even listed in the known issues section) Capcom will just sit on their butts like how they treated the Dragon's Dogma port which didn't get a good patch till like late in it's development cycle.PROS 1. The core gameplay loop is seriously addictive. Even if you don't usually play these kind of games it's easy to get really into it once you've hunted your first few monsters and are working your way up to better gear. And with the massive amount of people playing it right now getting friends to join you isn't too hard either. (When the servers actually stay up.)2. It's gorgeous. Some person wrote the that graphics look like they're from 2009 in the discussion page. Are you blind? JP game dev studios have always put art direction first and foremost in their game designs something which I really appreciate. Breath of the Wild Okami Super Mario Odyssey to name a few you can look back in like a decade and still feel like the games look amazing. MonHun captures that wonderfully here with sprawling vistas likelike monsters and beautiful set pieces it's really a feast for the eyes. If you have a rig that can run it well of course.3. It has ridiculous amounts of replayability and end game content. A problem I have with a lot of games like this is that once the game is done that's it. It's over. Especially MMORPG's. But MonHun doesn't have this problem. The game is constantly updated with new content and the tough boss fights in the end game will keep you going for hours. I've played almost all the MonHun games since Freedom and I've put like around 100+ in all of them. That's how you do content.CONS 1. Server issues server issues and server issues. When I first heard that Capcom was opting to use Steam's servers instead of the clan system they have on consoles I breathed a sigh of relief. At least Steam had the pedigree to keep multiplayer flawless right? Nope. The first day of launch was fine. But after that it was dc after dc after dc. Me and my friends can't even finish a hunt it's just so bad. Which is a shame because I waited out the initial console release just to experience this game with friends eight months after release and here I am hunting solo. If I wanted to do that I would've just played the console version and saved myself the wait.2. Optimization. Capcom isn't exactly known for optimization and it shows here. I glad that a lot of computers which are below minimum spec can still run the game unlike earlier reports but it feels like even beefy rigs struggle to run this game well owing to it's CPU heavy usage. Which is weird because the loading times are amazing even on my HDD but it feels like it could've really used some tweaking to get more out of it. I'm not a game dev though so maybe there's some super special feature which can't be disabled which is taxing all the memory and processing power.3. Those Egg fetching quests. What blood type are you Capcom? S? Are you S type? For sadistic? Whoever designed that mission where the Rathian chases you around while you're trying to deliver eggs and where the Aptonoths (or whatever those rhino thingies are called) keep respawning and trying to hit you while you're carrying their eggs is a sadist. He needs to be tied up with rope and left in a square somewhereCONCLUSIONSo as you can see I thoroughly enjoy this game and believe it completely deserves my thumbs up. But until Capcom fixes the server issues and irons out the kinks I will be leaving my review as a negative so that hopefully someone will take notice. Please Cap give me a reason to turn this thumb upside down. To the right side.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2019-01-07,0,0,140,False,Recommended,What will I say that hasn't been said before. This game is a MASTERPIECE! 14 highly unique weapons wit hvastly different playstyles. Tons of armor with virtuously limetless customization and fine tuning.You wanna be a badass wielding a bigass sword that swings as slow as a tank but also hits like one? BOOM greatsword! You wanna wield a sword and shield that ALSO turns into a big battleaxe that has a rediculously high skill ceiling? BOOM Charge blade! Wanna become a helecoptor? BOOM Kinsect Glaive! wanna enter MAXIMUM WEEB?!? BOOM Dual Blades!The environments are absolutely stunning. The zones are massive and have several secret pathways and little interactions that can make or break a hunt.Speaking of hunts lets talk about the 66% of the main title. Hunting Monsters!Every monster is incredably unique including the subspieces (not gonna bother explaining learn yourself). They vary from an evil hardcore looking pachirisu (that electric squirrel pokemon) to a rampaging pickle monster that uses OTHER MONSTERS as a ing WEAPON all the way to a traditional dragon and even a litteral b2 bomber dragon! They all have unique attacks behaviors weaknesses interactions with other creatures and their environments. You can either capture them or if you have a serious grudge against a certain monster (the roar is ingrained in my head) you can just outright kill it and skin the remains right off of it!This game has insane replayability and even im finding new stuff and learning new weapons every time I log in. Final verdict 10/10 would play again and again and again. Buy it full price or on sale this is a must have game.Also AW LAWD HES COMIN!,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2019-01-24,0,0,6,False,Recommended,Hmmm......... Is Monster Hunter World Good or Bad?Let me put it this way very seldom do I get too engrossed in a game. This is one of those times.Monster Hunter may be classified as Open World but technically it's more of Open Exploration of the Small World you have a map and you can go anywhere on that map and do a lot of things ranging from killing big monsters to killing small monsters to kill innocent herbivores to fishing (yes fishing) or catching bugs and collecting plants.The good thing about this game is that it doesn't require level grinding only item grinding... Which now that I say out loud is worse hahahaha. Because at least with leveling you get there at some point with item grinding you could collect all the requirements except one. But anyway the graphics and combat system are remarkable easy to master easy to appreciate. And it's not predictable at all times because unlike other RPG games where you just hunt the target in this game you could face more than 1 big monster even though you're only hunting a particular one. Bottomline is you'll probably get addicted after your first big hunt.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-12-28,0,0,104,False,Recommended,So I'll start off with the context that I played the PS4 version of this game for around 600 hours and I've put somewhere around 2 000 hours into the franchise I'm sure. Just picked this up because of the winter sale and I sold my ps4 for a switch and really missed this game. I only have a mid range rig at best but this game plays just like it came off the PS4 and in fact can feel even better at times. I highly recommend this game to veterans and newcomers alike it is such a fresh and explorative game and it gives you the power to do whatever you want whenever you want. This game never once feels like a grind and that's because of the sheer simplicity of it. You run around and collect and kill stuff to make stuff then you run around and kill and collect more stuff because you want better stuff to make and so the beautiful cycle of Monster Hunter pulls you in for one of the best experiences you will / have ever had.

2019-01-25,0,0,52,False,Recommended,"Maybe when it launched te game deserved a ""Mixed"" rating but it doesn't as far as I'm concerned. I'm told I'm only half way through the game but oh my goodness this game is a lot of fun.There's a ton of grind that doesn't feel like a grind I find myself wanting to fight against the same monsters so that i can learn their patterns find their weakspots and get their armorsets/weapons.The menus are clunky there are a ton of weapons that all play differently and the co op is hard to understand. (you cant do expeditions with others unless you use an SOS flair but you still cant if its an expedition for a quest and also if you complete a quest you can return to camp and THEN you're in an expedition but...... etc etc etc)But it's so fun and I haven't played an hour for each dollar I've spent but I wholly intend to and I fully recommend this experience to anyone. It's easy to get into (although guides whether they be online or via friends help tremendously) its a lot of fun to play and it's a great time.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

Being able to explore areas freely is awesome (so many hidden spots!) learn the terrain to take advantage of it during fights and simply just fighting stuff massively larger than you is an incredible feeling.One thing that a lot of games get wrong but this one did right the tutorial.The game basically unlocks features as you play so that you aren't overwhelmed and there a short popups with clear concise information to avoid any confusion.

The difficult along with the environment to immerse yourself in blew my 12 year old self's mind and truly inspired me.Now seeing a series that sparked my gaming love come to PC really was a sight to see. I dumped in 100 hours the first week it was released and I've had such a good time playing it. As it's the first Monster Hunter game to come to PC and other platforms the ""lack of content"" is understandable and doesn't bother me as there have been so many steps forward in the games mechanics from the previous titles. Open envrionments beautiful textures and exillerating monster fights all shown through a brand new lens. With new DLC planned for release and other fun events constantly occuring there's lots of fun to be had with friends and by yourself.

2019-01-30,0,0,67,False,Recommended,The best thing about this game is definitely the combat and everything around it. This was my first Monster Hunter and I was really impressed. There is a bunch of weapon types to choose from each with its unique moveset. The monsters themselves are designed very well and they can put up a real challenge. They also change locations during the fight so you get plenty of opportunities to interact with the environment and use it to your advantage. The variety of monsters is good and it will take you a long time just to finish the game even without any grinding. I would definitely recommend buying this game just for the sake of the combat and amazing boss fights alone.However the game is not perfect in every aspect. The story is meh and there is zero character developement. They also didn't do a great job with world building they just throw you into this world with zero clue what is going on. It also doesn't help that only the most important quests are voice acted and a lot of the dialogue which cover some of the lore is not. If this is what you are looking for this game might not be for you. I realize that neither story nor character development nor world building was the main focus of developers of this game but it would be so much better if they put more effort into these parts and make the game something more than just series of boss fights.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2019-01-11,0,0,186,False,Recommended,"Allow me to start off by saying I do not truly consider myself as a veteran. I was first introduced to the Monster Hunter series back in the good ol' days of 4 Ultimate when G Rank was something I could happily look forward to. With my time spent through 3 different 3DS XL systems and a 2 DS XL I had clocked roughly 900 hours into MH4U alone across 2 different accounts being lucky on two different occasions that my save data hadn't been corrupted with my 3 DS deciding to brick itself. Then came good ol' Generations where I'd spend yet another 1000 hours across 3 different account wishing for G rank to come back all the while screaming at the waste of space that is Blangonga and dying to a dabbing Communist Yogi Bear. That being said here's my standpoint on World as a whole...The game is good. There's no other way to put it. I put in roughly 500 hours into the game on PS4 with a few friends absolutely enjoying the hell out of everything before the MHWorld team decided to start pumping out Tempered and Arch Tempered stuff. Look I'll be honest as much as I want to take on a challenge just as much as the other guy some of us actually want to play the game at a more casual rate than others so introducing new content that's supposed to be on par with the top 10% of players is actually more of a kick to the balls then a friendly tip of the hat. I don't want to spend 10 hours farming Tempered Azurelos just at a chance for a crit boost gem I'd rather farm the subquest on a Brachydios Hunt and hope to Gog that I land myself the Charms I need for the next armor set I'm wanting to build. I thought that being able to craft charms and hoping to get certain decorations was a good thing (simply because of how many times I've had to farm for those damn Aquaglow and Sunspire jewels) but now I absolutely hate it.Speaking of gems and charms the skill system a basic watered down version of what us old gen players had to play with. There are no downsides and I hate that. There's no strategy involved with making an armor set anymore other than ""Durr hurr how many of armor can put on with much gem slot to make stroge to kill monster fast with less brain hurr durr?"" so (almost) anyone can slap together a few pieces that have similar skills and crank in a few gems and viola everything is good! Meanwhile back in 4U it takes a god like talisman with a few painfully hard pieces of armor to acquire for you to just have Honed Blade (Sharpness +1 plus Attack up L) and Steady Hand (Mind's Eye and Razor Sharp). It took me 40+ hunts before I could get my first Wartorn Dragonsphire even with breaking all the parts on that oily sunuva but I still love Gogmazios and will always have a place for him in my heart.Oh and monsters in this game? They're alright. Anjanath is a giant chicken wannabe Deviljho Tobi is actually fun to fight Great Jagras knows how to vore and Nergigante is just a big spiky pushover. I just wish there was at least one other water and thunder monster so I wouldn't have to feel bad farming Mudkip and Emolga.The weapons and how they handle is fantastic. Charge Blade is a happy medium between the 4U initial start and the crippling nerf of Gen/GenU Long Sword is a permanent favorite of mine and I appreciate the counter system (which didn't need a larger window for the counter to proc people just need to git gud) and Hunting Horn is more of a ""support"" team carry weapon than ever before! The only thing that messed up is giving weebs an excuse to try and hunt by making the dual blades be the way they are... Thankfully they nerfed Dash Juice and Wiggly Litchis exist but still...SO yeah I'll be on and off playing this 'till the winter expansion comes out. Gonna give it a whirl on console then throw more money at this amazing company and team to get the expansion on PC! You guys out there are some amazing people the developers and players alike (other than the stingy Hunters who auto kick someone if they don't like the way they look y'all can stop with that toxic nonsense) and I hope this game doesn't die out too quickly. Good luck and good hunting Doodle !",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2019-01-11,0,0,131,False,Recommended,Monster Hunter World is my favourite game of 2018. Beautiful landscapes surrounded by intense monsters which each require a particular skill set to master. There are 14 different types of weapons to choose from which are all available right from the beginning. Most of the gameplay consists of hunting monsters to enhance gear so you can in turn hunt even stronger monsters. I only played one previous installment for the 3ds but the strides made to reinforce and redefine the series with this version of the game have (imo) perfected the series. I was completely taken aback a couple hours into my first session when I witnessed a Jyuratodus come out of butt**** no where and it just began mauling this poor Barroth I was hunting. 'Turf Wars.' so hilarious and fun to be around. At launch there were some inconviences with online play but I personally got around it and was able to play a good chunk of the story with my friend after watching the cutscenes. Pretty excited to throw my $$$ at Capcom for the new dlc launching in the fall. 11/10 will give them my soul if it means another crisp Monster Hunter game like this one.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

Starts a bit slow and I didn't liked the tutorial quests but I understand why they were there and I think that is a good way to teach the basic controls to someone new to this kind of game.It's a friendly game to newcomers or at least friendlier than the previous entries in the series.The story is there to serve the gameplay and nothing more really. It's not bad neither brilliant it's just there.The gameplay loop is adictive in a good way. You kill oversized monster to obtain materials to craft sick weapons and armor to kill more oversized monsters. It's really fun.Graphics are nice and the game could get a little further optimization but it's not as bad as some people made it look.It can gate stale after you finished the main events and overcome the few milestones but there's a bunch of things to do to counter that Try a new weapon. There are 14 types of them and each is diffrent in terms of play style skills and aesthetics. Play with friends.

2019-01-28,0,0,17,False,Recommended,700 Hours and counting on Console.Incredible game with an enormous skill ceiling. Somewhere between Dark Souls and Devil May Cry. The attaining of mastery provides endless satisfaction as you topple enormous threats with increasing skill. Using the environment to your advantage learning your enemy knowing your own abilities. It all comes together for an exhilerating experience and one that's even better with friends.Progression is steady and expanding your options feels well earned. By the time you finish the main questline you'll just be getting started. Don't buy this game for a story there is barely a husk of one.The story quests will drag a bit at the beginning but you'll need the time to get your bearings. The focus is seeing and doing and wearing and fighting cool stuff. There are some neat concepts but there's almost no narrative tying it together. There is lore you can read up on elsewhere and I highly encourage doing so if you're interested.For the love of god give us an event for easier gold crowns on Elder Dragons. Please.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2019-01-27,0,0,189,False,Recommended,Very solid game. Not the best explanations of things and not the most intuitive of controls and options at times... but easily worth the tiny rough bit of learning for a very solid and lasting game. Just look at the amount of hours some people have put in and they are still finding amusing things to do. Watch some videos and when your getting incredibly frustrated ask another player or look it up likely they didn't fully explain something and you are just missing it. If you aren't able to handle learning or having things not just handed to you the game isn't for you. No real pay to win options just the game and the grind.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-12-06,0,0,39,False,Recommended,This game is outstanding. Monster Hunter has needed a break from the handheld platform for a while now and that's mainly because of the camera. I can't stand using a camera on the 3DS games because I have an OG 3DS and the camera is awful when using the touch screen. The nipple may make those games better but there's nothing better than a C stick. I was even content with using the mouse and keyboard when I started playing this port (I'm a light bowgun main and the keyboard and mouse are pretty managable with the bowguns.) Of course then the game finally let you play with a controller and that's way better.Already the presentation is better than the older games. There's a greater sense of speed in this game and that's something this franchise desperately needed. The graphics are also a noticable upgrade and the music is so good! This is probably the most cinematic the franchise has been and makes me desperately hope for a film adaptation that focuses on action and score mainly like the games do. These games have never had good stories and that's to their credit. Who gives a crap about where Zorah Magdaros is going? I wanna jump on a Rathalos and stab it until it's grounded! I see a lot of people saying that there's too much of a grind in this game and they're right. The Monster Hunter series has always had a ton of grinding but this game actually makes that less painful with the quick way you can pick up materials. Monster Hunter is best played multiplayer too and this game's SOS flare feels great. Struggling on your own? Fire a flare as it's never too late to ask for help. This game is the best the series has to offer and is one of my favorite games of all time.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-09,0,0,19,False,Not Recommended,"Probably the worst Monster Hunter game so far. It's too much of an MMO now. Like it was grindy and somewhat like a single player MMO in the past but this is a entirely different level. Gathering points respawn in like a minute account items are everywhere to the point that ""research points"" are basically worthless and the online play makes it so you can't pause the damn game even when you're playing solo hunts.In past games you had to keep track of your inventory and possibly ditch valuable items. Now you have an item box for account items one for gathering items and one for monster parts and ores. Meanwhile tools like whetstones BBQ spits and pickaxes do not take up space have infinite durability and are constantly equipped. So unless you spend an hour constantly gathering items you probably have enough space to carry everything.As for actual gameplay there's SO MUCH HANDHOLDING I CAN'T TAKE IT. NPCS CONSTANTLY SHOUT AT YOU TELLING YOU WHERE TO GO. MAGICAL PIXIEDUST FLY THINGIES ACT AS A QUEST ARROW POINTING EXACTLY WHERE TO GO. MONSTERS HAVE BEEN DEBUFFED TO BE MUCH WEAKER THAN PREVIOUS ITERATIONS OF THE GAME.I've noticed that environmental effects such as needing cold drinks to prevent stamina draining in the desert has been removed and I assume hot drinks are gone too. Quests have been cut down to only main quests and one or two side quests every so often. The canteen offers preset meals with the bonuses shown to your face straight off and all crafting recipes are automatic and 100%.All in all this is a monster hunter game with pretty graphics more multiplayer aspects and has been dumbed down to appeal to the average gamer even though the combat is just hard enough to make those players leave anyways so moot point there.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-09,0,0,438,False,Recommended,DO NOT BUY UNLESS ON SALE. DO NOT PREPURCHASE CAPCOM GAMES (they cant port to PC)I have based this review after my first crash of the game. Not as smooth as it should be for PC. I will update my review as time goes on but as a prepurchase at $65 its very sloppy. I like capcom. I do. I remember playing them back in the Snes/PSx era of video games. Megaman Breath of fire Resident evil street fighter etc Great consoles. But over time PC gaming became far superior over console. Sure consoles are still fun but consoles are just a closed PC like a mac. Would be nice to see Capcom switch to PC as primary platform since it would smooth out issues like this. From what I have played the game is smooth for fighting. Controls could be a bit more refine but that can be corrected as time goes on. Game still needs some updates for PC. No push to talk for voice chat. very annoying but can be patched later on. Watching video tutorials cause game to lag and crash so I cant watch them or play. I do remember console days and have an xbox controllers for my rig. Times have changed with digital downloads which should offer more flexibility to predownload before the launch time. Also for digital sales When you say Aug 9th make it Aug 9th at midnight. Aug 26th. Cant play the game without it crashes. I beleive its my nvidia drivers conflicting with denuvo.

2019-01-22,0,0,158,False,Recommended,This game is great just awesome. Challenging fights and lots of enjoyment playing with friends.As a downside it has a horrible story you can't do story quests online until everyone has seen the cutscene on their own. Which is weird. So you get these moments where 4 people playing together all start the same quest solo. 3 of them leave after watching the cutscene and then join the last player after they watch their cutscene. It's a silly system. Also one of the major bosses if just boring. And you're forced to face it three times.Not bad enough to give this a negative review.

2019-02-05,0,0,165,False,Recommended,Great Gameplay Mastery through Repetition A World that Breathes and of Course there are MonstersMonster Hunter World is simply one of the few good games available.Combat is the game s absolute strongest feature which may be a struggle to get used to at first but it gets way better through progression. while Every weapon combo imaginable can be executed at level one this is a game about utilizing the tools in your possession. Do not think you can defeat these monsters with just a oversized weapon so easily. with this said if you are looking for a game that gives you additional attack moves and super duper ultimate attacks with your favorite weapon style look somewhere else. If you are looking for a game with combat that relies heavily on resource management strategy a large variety of toys to play with and the thrill of hunting down enemies big and small buy this game.It can get repetitive to which I say what game isn t? sure you may be required to hunt the same target multiple times but it does not matter so long as you have fun every time. this game does exactly that because it is all about adapting and becoming familiar with your hunt. Its about how well you do the next time around compared to how much you struggled the first time.True to its name the world is fantastic to describe it appropriately. You are going to have a lot of fun exploring each map for the first time and interacting with the world. there are going to be times where you would not even think a certain area was reachable because everything blends so well. The world is so alive that you can hear it breathe. Other features include environmental damage using the environment against your target and using other monsters against other monsters.Monsters are the heart and soul of the game and they obviously spared little to no expense creating each one to be different. Though there is little variety in physique what matters is that each one feels different to hunt and that each one has unique traits and quirks. Most of all taking them down feels satisfying.This game is not without downsides however.Sometimes monsters get easier and that carries on to the next target but other times one monster can be so hard you d swear there was a difficulty setting change. This commonly applies to two targets so I hear. I don t want to spoil anything but to put it discreetly these two monsters are only hard because of one super overpowered attack they each have. There are also monster that can be somewhat annoying and its not because they are at all hard Let s just say that the reward money does not matter I d kill Bagel Grease and The Evil NO! for free any day.There are also many times (and I do mean MANY) where things can be unpredictable random and unresponsive. Some monsters attack faster than the human mind can react by both glitch and by intention since there is no build up to some attacks. it almost feels some attacks are meant hit you sometimes no matter what. Some damaging Hitboxes are often applied to the target s entire body as well meaning a tail from a monster s trampling forward charge (which often has no build up) will have the same damage as it would if you had gotten hit in the front. Above all else prepare for lots and lots of staggering stunning slowing air time and plenty of your face in the mud. you are also going to be in situations where you feel as if an attack should hit. i'm not going to lie this is probably the number one reason for a player to quit the game because i myself was very close. The game is also lacking in personalization for something with so many armor and clothing variants. To put it simply the game lacks a glamor system. You simply can t place the stats of one outfit to another. There are specific outfits that you can layer over armor to give it a completely different look but there is a limited few and they are only obtainable either upon completing in game challenges or paying for DLC.Here is what I think of the game overall.some monster attacks feel cheap there is a ton of scenarios where you simply can t do anything to help yourself against their attacks and the game lacks basic personalization features. However it is simply a really really good game. It has solid gameplay replay ability unique monsters and a fantastic world to explore. I think that it is definitely worth your time and money.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-10-08,0,0,149,False,Not Recommended,The game itself isn't bad at all though i have played the first to the 4th generation monster hunter games (i have no touched the hand held verisons) For me almost every monster is somewhat easy since most of the attacks are recycled from other older MH games.(the newer monsters have a mixture of their own attacks added with some based off the ones from Tri and frontier and 2)The only thing you'll see standing out is the differences of how effectively you can learn to use whatever weaponyou picked. Not every weapon suites just one person and don't ever listen to anyone who brags about the Long sword (LS) being the best those kind of players never touched anything else and they use LS based on the fact they are just a bit to lazy and all on learning how other weapons work in both disvantages and advantages that is the only differences in weapons is their advantages over each other but it all still comes down to how you are able to adjust and adapt with them.A lot of toxic waste and cancer as always on the steam discussions of just about anythingwhen you have questions about anything related to the game post it with the risk of getting random poor advice more than helpful ones.the graphics are crisp. (do not try and play this game unless you have a decent graphics card and at least min of 8GB of memory if you plan to use low graphic settings for med to semi high 12GB You might get away with mostly setting 75% 80% of the settings high but only if you know that the PC you own can handle the stress)I own a 1070 GTX TI and i have it set to medium/high and at times the game tends to tear if theres a lot of animation effects going off i never have any issues on any other games set to ultra settings think capcom should consider a graphic optimization in the future or at least a fix?First timers please understand that there is an learning curve to this gameKnowing the time it takes to execute attacks based on what weapon you choose.knowing when you need to evade attacks and how to use the surrounding enviroment to aid youLearning the attack mechanics of each monster can be tricky.But you'll eventually get the hang of it.Its best to figure out what works best for you and not be the type of person to base how you play on what others tell you.Advice is always there but always learn from it and apply your own tactics with what you learned while progressing into the game.This game is going through a lot of overall graphic quality patches which is making this game very unstable.Even with my 1070 or 1080 TI graphic cards my frames drop from the low 90's all the way down to nearly 32 fps. I can play elite dangerous with high settings and exploding ships and weapon fire can be going off around my ship and my frames will not drop down below 78.capcom is just screwing things up and the only ones who are sticking around mostly are those Narcissism generation stereotypes just to whine and complain excessively about the same issues every week to a month.My only mistake was purchasing this game and thinking it would have some what a slightly semi decent semi positive group of socially interactive people apparently not.even turning the graphic settings down to medium and low and turning off a couple of useless looking settings frame rate seems to only go between 35 46 which is decent but horrible for a gaming system that can handle ultra high settings on doom and ED and other games.all you will hear when you ask about issues is that is you and you alone you hardly get any positive helpful information.Thing is now this game requires capcom to seriously fix these issuesYou can have vover 16 24GB of memory (I have 24GB and i have two VGA cards 1070 and a 1080 an also a 1030 as a backup vga i have a six core processor AMD of course none of them are overclocked and i have had random fake stereotypes tell me my drivers are outdated or my PC sucks (This is their way of saying you suck cause you can afford these things and they can not cause they live with their parents and they can only afford low quality to medium quality PC stuff even if you got a decent vga card with 2 4GB ram and 12 16GB or memory you are good. Heck i've played this game with a low profile MSI Ge force 640 2gb vga card and had no issues till they adding more content and increased the graphic requirement(any whine and dine comments expressing any form of hate racial flame war will be removed. Also anyone exhibiting behaviors of toxic cancer like drama will be added to a list if bannables via game informer Destructoid and gamesradar+ which is constantly being monitored by over 32 000 groups of player based clans fleets guilds groups etc that play different games professionally and or causually so if you can not comment without acting like a spoiled whiny high demanding childish fool then don't comment at all please and thank you everyone for reading this),MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

The map is bigger and has open world with tons of things to explore. You have to hunt the monsters and get their parts to make stronger equipments. There are many types of weapons to choose from just try out which weapon you are most comfortable with. I love the overwhelming satisfaction in hunting monsters with my favourite weapons. Hunting in group is where this game shines you will be able to team up with 3 players to hunt down monsters. You can ask for helping hands by firing SOS flares to make your hunting easier. This is definitely one of my favourite games. Highly recommended.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

With the upcoming expansion in the fall of 2019 they'll be incorporating content that would otherwise be it's own sequel. The game is perfect to play with friends but the online community is so active that you can do it with strangers or solo. Queing makes it easy to find a quest with a party and hop in instantly. The level of detail put into the environments Poogie palico customization etc. are astonishing and its easy to waste time just simply admiring the optional things to do.An honest 10/10 game and to the dev team for constant (free) updates and support.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2019-01-23,0,0,290,False,Recommended,Extremely fun game.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2019-01-23,0,0,41,False,Recommended,Started playing this game when it was first out on the PS4 and its awesome. Controls took a little bit of getting used to but after that it was so much fun. Its a beautiful game with an awesome eco system and once you have worked out how to use the weapons effieciently combat has a good flow to it especially with the Switch Axe my main weapon of choice flashy and great damage. Some cool things about the game Palico your adorable cat companion who fights by your side is very useful especially when you get a certain gadget for it which helps harvest parts of the monsters Monster Behaviours and Parts I like how certain parts are breakable others are extremely tough and you can sever tails. Its makes you think more about where your placing your attacks and what weapon you will be bringing as well as learning when and where to block or dodge. Weapons large variety of weapons with cool attacks. There will probably be at least one weapon you love. While some of the weapons look meh at low rarities at rarity 7 and above they start looking awesome if they dont already. Capturing monsters gives you more loot so if you break and sever all the parts and capture it its more effient than purely killing everything also reduces some of the grind. SOS while I am a solo player. Trying to leave out spoilers but The monster you face in the Collossal Task quest is easy but there are breakable hidden in plain sight parts that will increase the drop chance of the rarest drop from that monster. Firing an SOS really helps get that item for when your farming the monster and the SOS flare gets a lot of attention fast. Turf Wars its awesome to see the large monsters fighting for territory and as long as they dont both target you it can work out in your favour. Mounting fun looks badass and knocks the monster down if you dont get thrown off. (You have to do a certain amount of damage before you can mount again worth knowing if you play with an Insect Glaive) No fall damage hitchin a rides on wind drakes mantels that lets you glide or do other stuff is funThere are a few cons Handler/NPC Partner (She's funny how she gets into trouble but a lot of players think shes annoying) Combat is tougher with others and the money/Zenny is divided between players also if someone faints it reduces the overall money so if you need more coins. (Although when your at a certain lvl there are easy quests/bounties that do give a lot of zenny. One about killing Coral highland Shamos and one about getting fossils from the place you unlock after the Coral Highlands.) If someone gets knocked out the whole team pays for it. If you play with others and someone on your team isnt doing well and keeps going down the team will fail the mission which is a bit harsh especially when helping lower lvls. Graphics on PC and PS4 not really that much difference. I also have a 3840 x 2160 monitor so would like to be able to have a bigger resolution than the normal 1080. But it still looks amazing especially in cut scenes.Things to note I've spent countless hours on the PS4 but only just started playing on PC the PS4 controller works completely fine on the PC Steam version but the control prompts are Xbox. There is a Dual Shock mod on Nexus mods if any of you prefer a PS4 controller no install just replace a folder with the folder you get from Nexus. Also note that the share button is actually the touch pad symbol and the touch pad is the R3 button. There aren't actually that many monsters some monsters sub catagories of other monsters so basically a different colour and maybe a different or additional element. However the tempered versions and events do give good rewards plus if you want full sets of armour or fully upgrading your weapon it can be very grindy so you may be too busy to notice this until you reach the end game ranks. If Poogie the cute pig in Aestera that you can pet dress and cuddle is happy enough it can find items for you around Astera if you put it on the floor when its bouncing in your arms. You can find all sorts around the tradeyard and somewhere there is a meal voucher if you want to eat for free )I brought the Deluxe version on the PS4 when it first came out and then recently got it on PC so definitley recommending this game.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

Stopping mouse movement causes your view to continue to slingshot in whatever direction you were turning for at times almost a full second. Flicking your mouse also fails to turn your character even slightly.This video details it quite well &gt /watch?v v0Y2aDAupZ4&amp t 154sEdit 2019 all this fixed now so good game thanks capcom,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

Regarding those two issues the first has been completely fixed and the second has been mostly fixed. There are still occasional disconnects but in general it's a smooth co op experience. In fact the reason I'm writing a positive review now is because simply put this is one of the best co op experiences on PC. This is just a game in its purest state no microtransactions loot boxes or pay to win elements. You have to earn the armor you don you have to earn the next hunter rank and there's no way to boost your own stats. As times goes on I grew to love MHW more and more and really immersed myself in improving my skills and making good builds.

The quality of life changes that this game brought with it are very welcome. The constant addition of events and updated/new monsters keep the replayability of the game high enough to keep me coming back. The myriad of weapons available always give you the option to change the way you play if you ever get bored.Admittedly the game does get a little stale after a little while but it's still fun with friends and you're free to open yourself up to a new playstyle to fight the monsters all over again if you wish.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2019-02-05,0,0,136,False,Recommended,Let me preface this by saying that I had tried Monster Hunter games prior to this and couldn't stand them.This is one of the best games I have ever played. There is a grind but the it somehow manages to not feel like a grind and even then you don't hit the grind until you've reached endgame content and you're basically just trying to perfect your loadout. I have over 110 hours in this game and sometimes I feel like I've barely scratched the surface. There are so many weapons and varieties within those weapons that you will absolutely find something that matches the playstyle you are into. You pay for the game and none of the game content is locked behind paywalls. This dev team is continuing to support this title well after a year after release with crossover events new content and updates throughout. Nor do you have to dedicate your entire life to this game. Yes there are timed events but those events come back often enough that even if you miss them you'll be able to come back later to work for whatever reward you want. And to top it all off the game is stunningly beautiful with some of the best environmental design of this game type that I have ever seen.

PROS You can get lost in this game and there is always grinding to be done.New updates often.Kills time like nothing i've experienced before.Flawless graphics.Everything other than the multiplayer is exceptional.Amazing weapon trees with a lot of weapon choices available.CONS Demanding as hell (nothing is pre rendered) bought a new P.C just to experience this game in glorious 4K.Huge huge downside is that it's P2P connection which I find pretty much counterproductive that you have to fiddle around with your router settings to be able to successfully play online (if it even works).I routinely get disconnected from almost every session I play there is no help to be found about this matter.I don't think a game you pay 50 for should force you to do this to play online with friends.I've had items randomly disappear after multiple saves of the game and have not reappeared back into my box.Player interface is quite tricky and complicated to get around at first.CREDITS NOT SKIPABLE AT THE END OF STORY (had to sit there for a good 20 30 mins and you HAVE to keep them rolling)There is no way of reporting bugs ingame as far as I'm aware.I know there's a lot of negatives the positives really outweigh them in such a huge way. This game is truly spectacular only if they actually added dedicated servers and not having to rely on someone elses connection or even if the person has a different ISP that can be enough to disconnect you.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

But before you read my review if you have terrible RNG luck I advice you don't even look at the reviews and avoid this game. Otherwise you will be grinding everyday and being salty why you can't get that freaking decoration jewel needed for your combo.Graphics is 8/10 Pretty good and huge improvement from the previous seriesStory is 5/10 I can't say much but it's a pretty boring main storyline.Gameplay 7/10 It's fun to kill all the monster but seriously lack of content as there too little different monsters to hunt. It's pretty much the same few monster over and over again. Arch Tempered version only hits harder. Once you reach the endgame you're pretty much just doing the same quest over and over again because this game is very RNG dependant which is the biggest fun killer for this game.

You constantly get stuck in a getting up animation and when I try to dodge it dives and I get hit before standing up.4. Stuns lasts for up to 8 seconds.5. There are hardly any options for you to upgrade you weapons it's either bone or metal and then you can upgrade it to give it special stats or statis boosts to elements.6. The game doesn't have terrible optimisation but it does tend to freeze before you die.8. Without being able to play with friends that can run or not lose connection and being stuck on the same level makes this game very boring as I have been going through this.9 Controlls sometimes bug out such as when I'm running my character randonly draws out the switch axe and then switches into the sword form on its own while I'm running from the massive T Rex and gets me killed in one hit because it stopped me from moving.The only problems I have is I recieve random messages saying the servers lost connection but thankfully the game automatically plays in offline and it doesn't require to load up again and I can still continue playing like nothing happened. Another thing I hate is how I still haven't revieved any weapon better than the basic bone upgrade from the basic weapon even after 11 hours of playing. If you like Dark Souls can stand playing alone and losing connection and can get past the difficult levels and not having much access to weapon upgrades then this is good for you.7/10 Fix the connection issues.To me this is only worth a max of $38 aud.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2019-01-23,0,0,53,False,Recommended,A really amazing game the only flaw is that the multiplayer is not as developed and great as we may think. The main dock is not shared with other players to make story quest together firstly you have to go you and your friends by yourselves until the cutscenes then you can all quit and make party to quest together. All that makes the game not that open world as we thought you gotta travel between maps. Pretty like Xenoverse but at least there's a lobby with other players there. This game is more for Solo the multiplayer side is really forced we can say. Anyway overall it's an amazing game i mean the gameplay is really fantastic.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

Its got a lot of in depth and complex features some of which can feel a little overwhelming if you're new to the Monster Hunter genre but after a while they make sense.It's getting a thumbs down for now because I bought this game to play online and the connection issues seem to be getting worse. (To the point where I can't even manually join a server that I can see is online) Also I'm not a fan of the 16 players per server this tends to result in no one doing the quest I want to do at the time and having to wait a long time for a party to form by which point you'll likely lose connection anyway lol.As soon as these issues are fixed it will get a thumbs upEdit The connection problems appear to be fixed but I didn't really play a lot I just wanted to give the game a fair chance.

Environments are far more detailed and graphically impressive than previous games.Combat only takes a few battles to get used to with the default controls but there's alot of gameplay mechanics (Astera Functions Armor and Weapon stats) That needs a few guides to understand for beginners.Sense of progression is great as you started with normal leather armor and eventually end up with sets of armor with incredible design. Combat is satisfying with audible slashing/piercing sounds accompanied by blood rushing out of monsters.Nothing beats the satisfaction of the succesfully hunted theme song after defeating a monster.Unfortunately no native 21 9 support so you'll need a third party software to enable full screen.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

Network connectivity still has random disconnects and issues from time to time. Story coop system isn't very well done (requiring everybody to view the cutscenes before being able to play together).

2019-01-07,0,0,79,False,Recommended,I bought this game with the idea to play together with my partner. Regarding the multiplayer this game is very focused on solo play. Literaly EVERY main story quest has a stupid cutscene which for some reason makes it impossible for your (co op) partner to play alongside with. Only after you are forced to watch a cutscene you can fire a flare so that everyone beside your partner can jump in your game instance. Very frustrating. Other mishaps with the multiplayer are that you cannot see or interact with your (co op) partner at the HQ and you can't depart on an expedition together (you need to complete a quest first before you both can enter an expedition). If you are a solo player and despise multiplayer then Monster Hunter World is great. The story is a bit stretched out and while you are hunting you may occasionaly notice the head of your handler or teamleader appear with a wall of text under it. Summarizing Multiplayer very badly designed not realy a multiplayer game.Story Stretched out thin with too many NPC interactions (I don't want to see the head of my handler appear while I'm hunting!)Graphics 7/10Audio 7/10,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2019-01-12,0,0,83,False,Not Recommended,Having played most Monster Hunter games I can definitely recommend this one. **I do not have experience with the online but I have seen multiple reviews stating that it is cubersome. Starts off a bit slow just like any other monster hunter game and eases you into things a bit (Granted I am a bit bias as I knew what did what etc). Based off of what I knew and how the game flowed I can definitely tell it was dumbed down to a degree to allow the masses to enjoy the game a bit more. (This is NOT a bad thing as some of the mechanics introduced are great) +++Autocrafting Pelico tools Tools in general (No having to carry around a pickaxe / bugnet) Recyled movesets for sure (noticed a good bit of similar movesets from monsters such as the Khezu) but they do have a twist to them so they're not entirely recyled. Optimized terribly for PC (I am still able to hit 75fps with my 75hz monitor) But the fact that it eats up my CPU is god awful with a nice overclock I am still hitting 80+ usage IN ONLY this game which I attribute to my frame dips here and there. Regardless of its optimization I still love this game and the franchise itself. Glad to finally have a proper PC game that you don't have to jump through hoops to play (*cough*Monster Hunter Frontier) Is this a bad port? YES and the culprit is likely Denevo. Do I still recommend it? Yes I do because any computer that has a decent Graphics card and an OK CPU should be able to handle this fine. (x5660 overclocked to 4ghz and a 980Ti Lightning Edition with 12GB of RAM) **EditThe network issues are absolutely abhorrent I can't even alt tab without it disconnecting despite having a connection abd being completely fine otherwise. Until (Which probably won't happen) I do not recommend this game anymore. The network issues are absolutely unforgiveable. I am so tired of it kicking me from hunts and kicking people from my SOS.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2019-01-30,0,0,53,False,Recommended,This game is super fun combat is usually very fluid and feels like you are actaully taking down giant monsters capable of mass destruction. The controls are fairly simple and very consistant. There are a ton of weapon choices from the swift dual blades and insect glaive to the hulking hammer and gunlance. With a handful of ranges weapons for those who don't like getting their hands dirty you're sure to find a way to slay monsters that suits you. However this game has a couple of glaring issues if you ask me (certainly not enough of them to warrant a thumb down).The first one and it is a fairly weak argument I will admit is that many monsters can insta kill you. It is easy to dodge most of the high damaging attacks and I rarely get hit by them because the monsters usually have a long or unique animation before the attack to warn you about it. However if you slip up by dodging too late or in the wrong direction many of these attacks will knock you out from full health even if you have a full resistance build to that type. Most high level monsters also have a way to stun you knock you down or otherwise take away your movement which makes it easy for them to land these hits. Regardless once you fight a monster a couple of times you will learn how to avoid these attacks which makes them a non issue.Another issue I find and this one is VERY important and may even turn many people off of this game. You can spend anywhere from 20 to 50 minutes in a hunt just to be disconnected. Sure you go into offline mode and continue the fight solo but the higher level fights are designed to be taken on in groups. If you're new to a monster fight low on gear or any other reason for sitting out of a fight for online play and suddenly you're booted into a solo match you're screwed. You likely aren't going to pose a threat to this monster since you haven't been fighting it. Now you can't rely on teammates distracting the monster while you get a good hit in then fleeing you have to face it all alone. Early on I've had no issues whatsoever with this. That is until I reached high rank hunts. Suddenly either I drop or one of my teammates drops in almost every hunt. Considering this game came out on console over a year ago you'd think the online play would be a bit more stable.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2019-01-30,0,0,414,False,Recommended,If you're into grinding and farming then this game is for you. This is the best monster hunter game mechanics wise though still lacks contents.

2018-08-09,0,0,219,False,Recommended,"Edit 4 I'm officially going to change my review to a recommend. After installing a 1080ti I'm finally getting the performance from this game that meets my requirements. It's sad that I needed this kind of horsepower but buyer beware I suppose. After having played 80 hours at this point gameplay wise there is NO REASON NOT TO BUY THIS. This is an amazing Monster Hunter experience and I will be playing this game for YEARS to come.Original ""DOES have controller support. Runs like on two 1070's in SLI with settings cranked all the way up. Didn't have my FPS counter but the frames felt slugish and low. NO 3440x1440 support! How is this still happening in 2018?! What did they use the last 8 months for? Defintely not making a good PC port! Runs on at least a 4770k without crashing like some have reported. 0/10 until performace is optimized and 21 9 is supported. Will be retuning the game.""EDIT 21 9 support has FINALLY been adressed and an update should be coming soon. The game is still HIGHLY unoptimized and I can barely play this game at medium settings at a stable 60 FPS. Gameplay is great. Autocrafting while questing is an odd choice but it seems to work. It's just more good Monster Hunter. Will Change to reccommend once 21 9 is implemented fully and performance is adressed.EDIT 2 21 9 Support has been implimented and that checks one of the two boxes off my list (sorta) However the 21 9 doesn't completely fill up the screen and leaves small vertical black bars on side of the monitor. At this point I am STILL using a mod to give me those extra pixels of real estate back. Performance has still not been addressed and I have had to resort to playing at some fairly underwhelming settings to get a (usually) stable 60FPS.if it weren't for my G Sync monitor I would have to lower the setting to medium or low to get a stable FPS without annoying frame dips.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

Aside from that the game runs smoothly and is a solid action RPG with fantastic gameplay.No real complaints just minor things timed battles are an added challenge but can be annoying if you are in expedition mode some monsters will randomly leave the map in the middle of a fight (or even worse right as you're about to defeat it) getting into a friend's game is more steps than it needs to be (the menu option to join a friend's game is broken so is the way through Steam overlay) you have to copy/paste your session ID and your friend must search for the game using this.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2019-02-07,0,0,346,False,Recommended,I should probably mention that is my first experience with the entire Monster Hunter franchise. And I have to say it was a very welcoming and captivating one that drew me in right away.To anyone like myself who might have felt intimidated at jumping into a long running series without touching the predecessors I'd say that those fears are unfounded. The game has a highly immersive experience and is very accessible even to casuals like I am(I'm a dooting stick main myself and spend most of the game running around drinking potions and swinging an oversized instrument at monsters sometimes landing a successful hit by accident).There are plenty of strengths to this game that others would do a better job at describing. So instead I'll just highlight my biggest gripe with the game and that is the lack of monster variety(from a newcomer's point of view). After my first hundred hours I began to tire of fighting overgrown lizards however diverse colourful and behaviourally distinct they were. The game might feel a little more like a Dragon Hunter than a Monster Hunter at times but with future collaborations and DLC sure to come I'm sure that the monster variety will be less of an issue come a few updates later.Thumbs up highly recommended. Also a little ashamed to admit that the Handler eventually grew on me somewhat.

2019-02-06,0,0,122,False,Recommended,As a veteran of the series I'd say this a very well polished addition to the franchise with many quality of life changes that make it easier to get into than previous entries of the series. If you are new to the series I recommend starting out with this game since it really does 'hold your hand' for the most part when learning the mechanics of the game. I'm not saying it's necessarily a bad thing (although veterans might find this annoying for the first part of the game where there is constant tutorials) but it really helps new players ease into game. I know for previous entries of the series players mostly had to figure out things on their own for the most part and they did throw a lot of things on your plate with constant quests being thrown at you and whatnot.Even though this may seem like not to large of a game as compared to older MH games mostly since it has The least number of monsters in a MH game Fewer maps Not the addition with G Rank being in game (will change when the Iceborne expansion releases later this year) Endgame may feel 'lackluster' compared to older MH games w/ no events happeningIt does have its improvements Each map is large interactive and is one continuous map rather than zoning b/w zones Monsters react more realistically with the player other monsters and the environment Improvements to in game mechanics (ie HUD quick crafting item box management) It's a beautiful game and the best looking so far in the mainline MH gamesAnother thing is that Capcom is constantly adding content to the game via event quests new monsters festival events and collaboration events and it's all FREE! What more could you ask for?! My only gripe with the game is adding a transmog feature (I know we have layered armor in the game but I wish we could transmog our armor to any gear of our choosing) and that the weapon and armor designs for late game gear have much to be desired compared to older MH games.Other than that I'd highly recommend getting this game. New players and veterans alike will really enjoy this game. It's good wholesome fun to play especially with friends and come on who doesn't want to wreck monsters with giant weapons to make cool looking gear amirite?! Plus with the Iceborne expansion coming later this year it is a good time to get into this game.Happy Hunting!!!,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

Mainly kushala daora worse experience I have ever had in my entire life infact it's similar if not better to rip your eyelids out with the claw end of a hammer. Please remove it in iceborne. But I had a lot of fun fighting kulve t. so it evens out ig. I just don't understand why they couldn't get game testers im sure they could have got some sweaty dudes to fight a few monster here and there to tell if they are a difficult and fun but no. Why capcom I love my steel boi what have you done to him. ALSO THE SERVERS ARE STILL TRASH PLEASE FIX THEM. But yeah it's honestly a great game. 9.3/10,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-18,0,0,201,False,Recommended,Firstly most of these reviews the majority of the ones that are bad are about Server issues between the Steam Servers and Capcom. Both of them are working on it already so they'll be fixed soon( tm) most likely.This is not my first Monster Hunter game. My first was Monster Hunter Freedom Unite for the PSP.Of course you can't exactly compare Monster Hunter World and Freedom Unite but what I liked here in World better then Freedom Unite is that World is definitly easier to understand and play (Thanks to way shorter loading screens).The wait on the PC port for this game was definitly worth it in my mind even if there are a few connection Issues.Many also don't understand that this game has a offline mode you don't HAVE to play online (even if it is more fun with friends). Some people (people like me) don't even have that many connection Issues maybe a few times every 2 3 hours but that's it.The Story behind the game is somewhat boring not really worth noticing. After all most of this games fun is based on hunting Monsters and making equipment out of their parts.The PC Version of this game is at the same Version of the PS4 when it was released. That is to say the 1.0 Monster like Deviljho Behemoth (from the FFXIV Crossover) etc. haven't been included yet.I run a GTX 1060 2 Monitors have only had 2 3 crashes on 'high' settings with a few 2 second freezes here and there if I tab out of the game while hunting.TLDR this game is definitly worth getting even if there are a few problems.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

I don't even care and I understand the steam reviews and I hope that Capcom is reacting quickly because I'm one of these guys who has talked friends into this piece of crap and we have invested 100+ euros to play this as it was advertised An amazing coop experience.I gave up looking for a solution after realising that PS4 players had the same error and issues after launch (!) and this has nothing to do with the reddit theory crafting of the new Steam UI &amp friendlist causing the issues. I have played 33 hours since release on steam and I love every single part of the game The controls (gamepad is a must) the animations the depth the monsters. Please fix your +++ UPDATE THIS HAS BEEN FIXED ONE WEEK AFTER RELEASE +++And by the way I am shocked and really disappointed that none of the cool independent popular and objective go to internet reviewers like 'ACG' and others didn't mention this small little detail regarding matchmaking with friends and the need for them to watch cutscenes first and abort quests (!) to be able to join others.

With 14 weapons and even more monsters you will have lots of things to master but the in game mechanisms to teach you those skills are lacking and you are forced to seek the information from outside sources if you are new to the franchise. The habitats and monsters are well planned and executed. They exist and interact with or without you just as real nature does. While some monsters ignore your presence others will get angry at the mere sight of you.Get ready to be frustrated as you faint but get rewarded when you finallly down that tough beast.

2019-01-27,0,0,155,False,Recommended,Monster Hunter is a franchise that I was initially hesitant about getting into. Originally I also had never really formulated a solid opinion about the series considering how much talk I've heard about it from friends and online discussions. Last year I bit the bullet and gave the franchise a shot by getting Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate just to get a taste of what was to come. Played it extensively found that I loved it and eventually wanted to get into World.World is a fantastic experience for a newly introduced player like myself. It greatly refines the Monster Hunter formula by cutting out bulky concepts found in the previous games while strengthening mechanics with numerous quality of life improvements across the board. If you're a visual learner like myself this game lays out almost everything in front of you and it becomes fast to pick up and learn new habits. With an awesome gameplay loop and 14 customizable powerful weapons to fit your playstyle this game is rewarding for both newcomers and long time experienced veterans. Thanks to World I think I'll be sticking with the Monster Hunter franchise for a long time.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2019-01-26,0,0,109,False,Recommended,Do I recommend this game? Yes. For what it is.. the game ultimately does what it sets out to do. I got about 100 hours out of the game before I uninstalled however only about half of that was prior to the horrible end game grind.Pros Beautiful Graphics. Interesting engaging and dynamic monster fights. Co Op with up to 3 friends. Controller AND M+K support.Cons Repetitive fights. Only around 30 Monsters from beginning to end. Certain monster fights feel like reskins of other fights. The Co op play is not very intuitive feels very clunky. Weapons don't feel or look very unique to their numerous counterparts of the same type. Overall this is their first attempt at doing a PC port for the Monster Hunter franchise.. and it definitely feels like it too. So take that as you may. For beginners or long time fans of the series this game does a decent job of engaging everyone once you get past the pretty steep initial learning curve.Would recommend but not for $60. Catch it on a Steam sale.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-12-16,0,0,133,False,Recommended,This game is incredible particularly if you like travelling to strange exotic lands meeting strange exotic monsters and killing them.Seriously the game consists of a cycle of moving to a new land full of strange flora and fauna fighting through increasingly big and angry monsters turning their teeth and claws into weapons and armour climbing to the top of the food chain and then moving to a new area to do it all again. And what a series of beasts it is terrifying dragons which poison you with their claws before they light you on fire lizards who swallow dinosaurs whole and bloat up to gigantic size scaly flying squirrels that crackle with lightning. Quite an array of monsters and that s just the very first area a lush forest surrounding a gigantic tree which you slowly work your way up until you fight the huge dragon in the nest at the top. Good thing you can team up with up to four other hunters to tackle these beasts or you can tackle the challenge of fighting them alone (though you always have an SOS flare if you bite off more than you can chew!).The exotic locales your hunter travels to only get better as the game progresses as you see the majestic Coral Highlands and the fetid and grim Rotten Vale (filled with the dead and decaying remains of the beasts you ve fought thus far). I ll hold off on describing more of the regions you ll traverse and the monsters you fight because I promise you ll want to explore and research them for yourself. You ll get the chance to learn 14 different weapons each suiting a different playstyle allowing you to smash horns off with colossal hammers fill the enemy with explosive lead with gigantic bowguns and slice clean through tails with a range of swords. Again I won t even go into detail on the more complex weapons and techniques but I highly recommend the Official Monster Hunter World weapon overview playlist on their YouTube channel if you think the game sounds interesting. https //www.youtube.com/playlist?list PL7z ZXbhfoKH0VlmoMX1Q5Wwk1cNRvrUV If none of this is catching your fancy the game s not for you. There s not much more to the game than fighting the variety of monstrosities and using their parts to make weapons and armour to fight even bigger beasts. If that s not your thing then move along. But for those of you who think all that sounds fun then be ready for hundreds of hours of beast slaying.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-12-21,0,0,243,False,Recommended,"Tldr at the bottom.After playing this for a while now I have fallen in love with it the breathtaking graphics (which I am greatfull for the hardware I have to see it in the first place) and the storytelling for the ""main"" story line was incredible.The item design was great at some fronts (wyvern ignition) but I noticed some items had repeated textures (kadachi claws 1 2 3).The AI was ok but sometimes were wonky and sometimes things look quite weird (kirin running to a ledge but not going off yes i know it should be that way but it just looks jank ) (up a ledge down a ledge repeat) but most of the time it was ok.Difficulty was challenging but not hard it really tested every skill i had (ahem tempered kirin) but I would want more things to be doable solo (I know you can do most of everything solo but some are just tedious no remorse no surrender or just downright impossible slay behemoth i got to final phase as time ran out ).But the difficulty choices in my opinion was quite properly done to truly test every fiber of the player on certain quests but maybe a tad bit of balancing would be better in my opinion(this is coming from a dark souls player) as most of the harder quests have been just me evading and at the end timing out.The lurning curve is more of a learning slope really learing how mounting and KO damage and their diminishing returns worked what all the slinger ammos did learning what the weapon elements effects(elderseal) and ailments actually do weak points breaking and severing parts untold moves or features in the moves (demon mode preventing knockback) (slinger torches clearing poison gas in the rotten vale) and much more but it was satisfying to say the least after conquering said slope.The tutorials did help but there is little to no incentive to look into the hunting guide as it's not giving too much for you to work with (maybe add moster habits like nergigante's spikes growing and blacking and him doing the dive when all of them are black and it reseting after said dive. I know you'll say ""Oh but you should have realised it at that point."" but it's nice to get a refresher here and there and some things I don't even realise like lavisioth with its hardening lava which gives him armor which if you need to reheat once in a while to be able to easily hit it. at research level 4 5 or 6 would love it).Recommendation get the npcs (excitable a lister hunstman) to help you out in SOME NOT ALL solo runs (they don't even have to be insanely great but at least get another more ""reliable"" source of damage or bait but for important attacks like behemoth's comets to always target the player) but remove them when going multiplayer to help with some of the more tedious quests as you palico can't really replace another player.If you could in any way lower the price it would be great as the hefty price is deterring some people from buying it and since this game wants to promote multiplayer as a core feature playing with more of my friends would be better than just those who actually can afford it.SOS or randoms is not an excuse though as most people who jump into SOS don't communicate as much as you expect and can wreck games your own or others (sorry for those who I have wrecked yours).And last but not least connection issues sometimes I'm helping someone in an SOS and then we do well but suddenly dun dun dun my internet decides to cut out and I die a horrible death and fail the quest for my team or it's them not everyone has insane internet speeds and if they die and later cut connection soon after or right before their death don't count it it's not their fault and if everyone leaves or you leave the quest due to connection loss reset the difficulty please I don't know how many times I have cut out from a behemoth quest died on their screen and had to face a multiplayer behemoth ALONE.So in conclusion if you want great graphics storytelling rpg elements a really well done learing curve and memes here and there and don't mind putting up with wonky AI meh randoms slightly off difficulty mechanics the inevitable materials/gem grind and getting beaten into a pulp once in a while then Monster Hunter World is the game for you.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2019-01-26,0,0,159,False,Recommended,A rather thin experience compared to previous Monster Hunters but they're expanding upon it so here's hoping for greater Monster Hunter for the new look.Simplification always rubs the wrong way with the removal of gunner/ blademaster visual sets for the same looking armor to be used with different penalties on what weapontype you use it with. Lack of content in areas that could definitely use it environments are pretty but more than four would've been appreciated. More than 3 houses would've been appreciated the second is the best but would've appreciated being able to do more with them.Game is wonderful but needs a lot of expansion. Worth the price to enjoy what's there but veterans may feel it's a bit sparse.

2019-01-25,0,0,182,False,Recommended,As it's usually said Monster Hunter World is definitely the most accessible game in the series so far. I'm impressed with this iteration of Monster Hunter as it keeps a lot of the personality of previous Monster Hunter games. The story is pretty standard but the point of MH games are the combat and crafting not necessarily the story. The end game leaves a little to be desired as it revolves heavily around RNG versus games previous in the series.However the progression through the game is well paced. If the game starts to get stale you can always switch weapons and learn everything over again. Weapons have received numerous updates compared to older games and the controls are very fluid. The new monster designs are great and the soundtrack is amazing.In short if you like Monster Hunter pick up this game.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2019-02-01,0,0,566,False,Recommended,After waiting for so long for a proper Monster Hunter Game since they moved the title to nintendo the last MH game i played was the one for the PSP I have been truly looking forward to this game. And now a year after launch and 500+hrs in i think i can safely give my honest review of it.First the bad It has a rocky start with so much issues with regards to optimizing and tweaking your setup for it to run without chugging. Given my rig isn't the best BUT i have been able to run it without looking like a potato. Server issues and disconnects for some reason it is back the disconnects but not as often but often enough that you can get bummed out by it. If you don't like grinding and somewhat repetitive routines (not sure if this is a bad or good i guess this wholly depends on what you want in your games for me i like i like MH mechanics oddly enough it's a grindy game but for some reason i enjoy it more than say Diablo 3 which is also grindy with a bit of RNG)With that out of the way now the GOOD bits It's a breathing living world complete with weather cycles interactive environments verticality flora and fauna. It is hands down gorgeous (and i'm not even running it in Max settings! cause my rig is a semi potato any more than medium settings chugs my frame rate) so much quality of life updates from what i was used to compared to old monster hunter games (things just feels way more streamlines here in MHW) Gratifying combat and the feeling of pride and accomplishment once you've been able to best that beast in combat and carved out it's entrails for parts. Constant free content and support for the game! Cool looking armos and weapons and layered duds so you can play dress upFinal thoughts If you like killing monsters if you like collecting parts repeatedly without feeling the grind. Then this is a game for you and if you are a returning Monster Hunter player you'd be very pleased to find so much quality of life changes have made this such a fluid game. Given it still cannot match the number of monster variety to other titles of the same game but it is still one of the best Monster Hunting Game out there right now at least in my opinion. Better than say Dauntless (i tried it it and it was okay but just didn't stick with me i just felt something was missing in that game) and so did God Eater it was a good game but it also didn't scratch that itch i had for monster hunting.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2019-01-27,0,0,157,False,Recommended,As my first foray into Monster Hunter this has been a really positive experience. Here are a few pros and cons off the top of my head.Pros Excellent graphics. The game simply looks beautiful. The lighting is exceptional and there are few graphical issues other than a few small bugs that are settings related. Great gameplay. The combat while a little clunky feeling and hostile at first it really shines when you get better. Once you dedicate yourself to learning the proper tactics and anticipation it becomes quite satisfying to take out some of the monsters you initally struggled with at first Progression is tied to your gear. No level ups or perks to buy. Your gear decides the effectiveness of your build. Finally the tracking of monsters is well done. Rewarding hunts. There is a Dark Souls level of satisfaction in killing a very difficult monster and some of the monsters take a heck of a beating Cons Lack of direction. Sometimes the game just sort of leaves you high and dry without any sort of clue what to do next. Theres a few places I think they could put a tutorial in and just smooth the learning experience out or offer a better explanaition of the mechanics. Loss of control. I don't mind mechanics that punish you by restricting you but totally removing you from the driver's seat is a bit much. I feel the stun and roar mechanics could use some work. I am far less annoyed by the stun mechanic though. If you don't get hit you should be fine but the roar mechanic to me is too much. Monsters roar constantly and most of them completely freeze your character up. This in the middle of a fight can leave you totally open to attacks and gets you killed. The method to prevent this is poor in my opinion. The earplugs skill is really dumb as a stand alone skill and needs to be buffed or made a passive piece of all armor sets. Like make it so that having a full helm adds levels of it or make a berry like consumable that keeps roaring from affecting you. But as it stands I think the mechanic is a little unfair. Specs are a little much IMO. I feel that it could use a little optimization for lower power rigs.Overall this game is approaching masterpiece level to me. It is a GOTY level game. The game shows the passion of the developers through all the quirks and the character it shows. This game if it ironed out a few things could be a perfect 10 but that said it will still pull 100s of hours out of your playing time with little effort.9.5/10,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2019-02-08,0,0,357,False,Recommended,Alright. My first review. Lets go over the PROS before the CONS.PROS A lot easier than any of the previous MH titles. It feels a little more mainstream. Which is both good and bad. For me its a good thing since most of my friends now play the game and were slightly turned off from the previous titles. Extremely fun solo or multi play. Controls in PC are ok. You'll get used to it. Graphics are great especially on max settings.Cons The extremely frustrating disconnection issues are getting somewhat out of hand. I've been getting disconnected with online hunts and its ING annoying. FIX! THIS! Imagine being 8 mins in a Arch Tempered Hunt and boom you just got disconnected from your friends! Not that much variety in the weapons. Some look the same. Oh well. Hopefully the upcoming IceBorne content will make things better. Variety wise.So there! Youll love this game. But be prepared to get extremely frustrated with the disconnection issues.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

But my review will be negative until they add some PC features quality of life things to the game. They had almost 1 year to make a PC version as promised not bring us a console port missing PC game features and QOL.+ Graphics are good about 8/10 looks very nice but nothing mind blowing.+ Performance early on is great very smooth on my GTX 1080 as it should be+ Nice character creation system + My controller works fine (I regiustered it in big picture before playing to be sure)+ Loads of monsters &amp weapons (compares to Dauntless the F2P PC MH game) UI design is console style they didn't update it for PC Hitboxes &amp monster AI along with crispness of rolls/hits are inferior to Dauntless The voice acting does not match the mouth movement with what they say No 21 9 support (Really bad since I have a 34"" Gaming monitor that uses this) Mouse controls are terrible (bad PC port instead of real mouse control) Inability to change settings such as motion blur and other PC basics in the settings I get a long black screen at launch of the game that lasted about 2 5 mins(game is on SSD) so its some kind of bug happens all the time.I am only at the beginning of this game but it plays smoothly and looks nice but they left many things ""console style"" and I will not give this game a positive rating until it has 21 9 support I did not wait 8 months for them to leave out PC features like this.UPDATE 2019 They just added 21 9 support so I can finally play the game in full screen no black bars they updated many other things to improve the game as well. They keep adding new events for free so the game continues to be very fun to play.

If you wanna go stabby stabby on giant monsters solo it works but I would give Dragon's Dogma a try first.The game is great at the start when it keeps giving you new monsters and areas to learn. But do keep in mind that gradually almost without you realizing it it starts to push harder and harder towards repeating the same hunts in ever increasing numbers for ever decreasing percentual chances of drops. And tying into my mention of other people it will also gradually shift more and more into content designed from the ground up to be tackled by a team.Or you could just goof around at your leisure and mod the game as you want and do whatever. There are unofficial mods for just about anything from quality of life improvements to cosmetics to rebalance grind reducing and of course a lot that could be called cheats.So you can personalize the experience.

Grinding the same quest literally hundreds of times trying for a random chance to get a weapon or skill you want isn't fun or challenging or rewarding. It's just dumb. I need to feel like I'm actually progressing towards what I want it can't just be a completely random chance. It wouldn't even be such a problem if the odds weren't so astronomically stacked against you. If I played the quest over a hundred times and I was actually closer to getting the item I want that would be one thing. But taking away any form of progression takes the fun out.

2018-08-20,0,0,154,False,Recommended,I got this game since day 1 and it was badly optimized on release. However Capcom has made the game now very good. It should've been like this from the very start but it's very undeniable this game is far from what it was on launch on PC. In short Optimization is now better. At launch my PC could not run past 30 frames for its life but now I can get 40+ frames consistently. PC controls got better significantly. There's still the bad menu controls but camera controls are so much better since you are given the option to basically use the mouse as a MOUSE and NOT as a controller stick. Alt+Tabbing doesn't make the game crash anymore fortunately but it does disconnect you from being online. It's not as bad as the game crashing fortunately but getting disconnected mid hunt can sting a bit especially when the rewards (specifically currency) are divided between all hunters a part of the hunt. The three main problems that really killed this game for me on launch were mostly fixed out of the game essentially and now I can enjoy the game much more to the point where I would change my review to recommend the game. Right now it can only get better and hopefully no stupid decisions are made but I doubt it.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-11-26,0,0,172,False,Recommended,"As someone who has always had his eyes on the Monster Hunter series but hasn't gotten around to playing it due to it being available only on Nintendo consoles and being too lazy to actually go and buy it this game has really been a blast for me so far though I sadly haven't played it as much as I've wanted to by far.There have been a few situations here and there where I felt it was a little wonky of an experience but that was as far as I can remember at least mostly just due to me not being used to the series's style of gameplay yet.I might update this review now and then with more insights as I go.Combat In this regard the game is overall really well done. You have a very complex combat system with many weapons and each of them with a good amount of skill sets some of which you need to ""unlock"" during combat (like the Kinsect where you need to have your insect gather the red white and orange upgrades by hitting certain monster parts for optimal buffs and upgraded attack animations for a set time period). If played right the combat is also very fluid which is very important for a game like MHW.One thing I dislike so far is that when in a combo it doesnt seem to respond to slight directional input as well though this could possibly just be due to me not having figured it out completely yet.Audio Here too I think they did a pretty good job. The background audio is nice to listen to and so far I don't think I've encountered any issues at all.Multiplayer This is one point where I'm generally happy as you can create your lobby with preferences and choose to be with beginners like myself or veterans (this is of course based on players' input). You have a good few settings to configure what type of player is most likely to join and other options like kicking sending friend requests (""Guild Cards"") and so on.Now one big part I don't like is that there are connecitivity issues here and there namely getting an error when trying to join friends' sessions (here I found that just trying several times and alternating between friends on the list if they're in the same lobby can help) some desync thanksfully rarely so far and a few others that I can't remember at the time of writing this.Bugs and Issues One thing I really hate is when tabbing out to respond to a message and tabbing back in only to see certain inputs not working anymore (in my case the Y button on my controller for combat while still working in menus) and having to restart the game for it to work again.(Opening the Steam ingame overlay before tabbing out seems to remedy this issue.) A friend randomly had all combat input not work anymore randomly for a little while on a mission but it started working again a few minutes after.All in all I really like the game and would definitely recommend it to anyone interested but I hope they improve the game in these regards.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

Amazing graphics even if you run on low settings it is still better than any monster hunter that the US has gotten so far. 2. Weapons all feel satisfying and I recommend people try at least their 3 favorites as they play the game. 3. The enviroments feel real with the monster interactions.Cons1. Initial release ruined the game for a few people. The game was not released optomized but this is no longer an issue. 2. Could have more monster but I would be willing to pay up to 20 for 5 or more monsters in a pack (with their weapons and armor). Sounds bad but there is enough content for a full game here already I just want more.Update As of Dec/4/2018 this game gets a thumbs down. I keep gettinig error 5098f mw1 when I join a session. I wanted to say this is one of the best game but I can no longer say it with confidence. If capcom can fix this issue I will give it a thumbs up.

2019-01-22,0,0,93,False,Recommended,Monster Hunter is a special genre for gamers who like grinding for better weapons and armour sets. Monster Hunter World does a good job in terms of quality of life features. Although not everyone like the new mechanics (f.e. bugs instead of colour balls the new mantles etc.). I would call myself a Monster Hunter veteran. I played since MH3U through MH4U MHG/U and now MHW. Every game of these until end game content for over hundreds of hours.After a few hours I loved the mechanics and features of MHW. Some more some less. I played for about 300h on PS4. Nevertheless I hope some features of the old games find their way to World. F.e. playing as a palico store palicos with different skills and features hunter styles etc.What I really missed was the 21 9 support which was one of the main reasons to stay on PlayStation 4.

From a gameplay perspective MHW is the easiest and most accessible game in the MH franchise. I would strongly recommend going back to play gems like MH4u and MHFu if you enjoy this game. But most importantly don't give up after 5 hours!! This game takes a good 20+ hours to start getting in to. But it is so rewarding when you do.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2019-01-24,0,0,85,False,Recommended,First JRPG I've ever played and it was a lot better than I would have gave it credit for. Different weapons with different play styles for each different kind of player (Ranged dps support heavy strikes quick jabs etc) to keep you interested in the game. Once you master one weapon try others! While its fun to play with friends its also incredibly rewarding to hunt difficult monsters by yourself too and while it might be difficult its not impossible. Great game if you like challenging gameplay that rewards skill and methodical tactics.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2019-01-12,0,0,88,False,Not Recommended,A boss fighting game like any other were you punch a brick for hours and if you ever miss a dodge you die. How this game is unique is you have a set amount of time to kill the boss preventing you from playing smart and waiting for opportunities and forcing you to constantly run towards and enemy that more than likely has an attack up its sleeve that can kill you in one hit. 90% of the time the boss can fly so it uses this ability to waste your time the only way to counter flying is with a limited amount (3) consumables that force it to land for 2 seconds each. Like other boss fighting games you will find that the monsters only take damage to one area but unlike other boss games I have played you use Japanese anime weapons that are ridiculously large so you will swing for the neck hit the wing with a downward strike reflect off and be stunned for a few seconds. After doing damage to the boss it will run away from you to the opposite corner of the map forcing you to chase it and waste more time. That is the game rinse and repeat there is a story in the back ground but all the characters have a distinct Japanese feel to me that means over the top and insanely annoying. The entire premise of the game is you are part of a group of monster hunters when you are at base there are people around but they never help you in fights. Even if the story tells you that this dragon is like a god and you are going to need all the help and luck you can get. When you get back to base they don t even treat you like you are the only one doing anything they act like they all contribute to the cause. This isn t really unique to monster hunter but I think it bothers me more in this game because these people have been on the continent for like 40 years or something and no one accomplished anything till you showed up. In the end the game feels supper mediocre to me but the games has sold enough copies that I m sure they will make more pc monster hunter games in the future the only question is if they will be willing to change the formula much. In the end I bought this game to play with a friend and after you leave normal skill quests in this game you kinda are forced to play the game with others because otherwise the game just isn t fun.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2019-02-09,0,0,108,False,Recommended,One of my favorite series of all time I've sunken nearly 300 hours into the game between console and PC. Pros Numerous quality of life changes make this the most accessible entry in the series The ecosystems and the monsters that inhabit them feel more lifelike and robust than ever before Loads of free DLC in the form of free content updatesCons Multiplayer/matchmaking systems are unnecessarily complicated and frustrating until you adjust to them Compared to previous entries in the series the weapons aren't nearly as diverse in appearance PC version of the game still is synchronized with consoles with regards to the content updates,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

No SLI support Server issues like 8 out 10 times it won't connect.The port is an unoptimized peice of garbage.The UI is made with consoles inmind thus no drag and drop items with the mouse but whats a very bad decision is you need 10 20sec to access chat without the ability to use a custom keybind to it.We waited for 6 months in hope well get a good port but we got an unoptimized mess of a port that 8 out10 times won't even connect.

2019-01-25,0,0,13,False,Recommended,If you are a fan of the franchise you already know what this game is about. I wasn't till this one so I will write my review as a person who have played a Monster Hunter game for the first time.TL DR If you are an MMORPG lover who also enjoy raids with friends or grinding and leveling up your character and kill endless bosses and mobs alone this game is for you (I highly recommend playing multiplayer though) The game basically is boss fight after boss fight in every quest enemy variations are great and combat mechanics are not simple to learn yet not impossible and you'll definitely have fun while doing so. Though I'd say don't expect a mind blowing story cause you won't find it in this game the game is not about the story anyways. It's about hunting monsters and it does what it supposed to do very well.Graphics are good but I should warn you though you definitely need a good PC otherwise you won't get a good framerate or you'll end up playing the game with potato graphics cause even though the graphics are great and smooth in most occasions it's not really that succesfully optimized for older systems so even medium graphic settings looks very bad.Audio is nice and fitting soundtrack does work very well with the game which is all I need from a game soundtrack anyways. (Though when a game has a soundtrack that can be considered a masterpiece I never complain obviously)I played it with both controller and keyboard and since this game heavily depends on weapon (of your choice there is a good weapon selection in game which is a plus) combos I'd say it's way better and comfortable with a controller. But that doesn't necessarily mean that it was badly optimized for keyboard users it's doable. It's up to your preferences I guess.And last of all grinding is a real thing in this game you'll end up grinding for supplies killing endless amount of monsters and if you find grinding in games intolerable you'd end up hating this be aware of this before you buy it.TL DR ended ) Over all I really enjoy this game it's challenging it's fun and it's well worth it's price.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-10,0,0,78,False,Recommended,"This game is finally in a good enough place where I can recommend it.At launch the game was kind of a mess. Multiplayer didn't work FPS was just awful (Mostly Nvidias fault for their crap driver) and the camera controls sucked for mouse. This has all been MOSTLY fixed. Multiplayer seems to work perfectly fine now Nvidia has fixed their driver and now FPS is mostly fine (Should honestly be better than it is though) and the camera has finally been fixed so it isn't super delayed.The game is really good. It's a lot of fun to kill monsters with people or just yourself and your palico. If you do end up picking this up I'd recommend downloading and installing the mod ""Special K"" to help out with your FPS. I'm not sure if you can be banned for using it but honestly it gives absolutely no advantage gameplay wise so I doubt they would ban anyone for it. The only thing it does is disable some CPU thing that bogs down performance that isn't needed. With this mod I can play at 60 in most places.

2019-02-06,0,0,94,False,Recommended,I first got in contact with the Monster Hunter Series 10 years ago when Monster Hunter Tri was released for the Nintendo Wii. To this day Monster Hunter Tri remains my all time favourite game for the Wii. The atmosphere the gameplay the looks everything was done just right. Unfortunately Capcom decided to shut down the online service a long time ago. So I didn't play MH for a long time aswell. Then Monster Hunter World came out. I gotta say nostalgia hit me a bit... I really love MHW. It does everything MHTri did for me and even more. I don't understand the negative reviews concerned with optimization problems. It runs super smooth (I recommend the use of a controller tho). Super Great Game 10/10,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

And now with Iceborne coming out this could shape up to be the greatest entry in the series history. Have bought the game twice now and have put over 300 hours in and I am still having a blast. That said you have to enjoy the grind once you get past 50 hours but if you like the game then grinding isnt a chore. Make sure to change up your weapon type (14 of them!!) once in a while to keep the game feeling fresh.

Very addictive be it collecting resources and acquiring new weapons.Cons Some parts of the story aren't explained well e.g. finding a certain amount of monster tracks Can be RNG Grindy (Generally the grind is good creates a real sense of progress) however some items have a relatively low carve rate. Very easy to accidently delete your save file on title screen literally 2 taps and its gone.My verdict A must buy if you have a decent PC set up! 9/10.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2019-02-05,0,0,330,False,Recommended,A game about hunting monsters. When you first start out every monster scares you. By the end of it YOU are the monster. Single player is pretty vanilla but the co op makes it enjoyable. The real fun begins once you reach the endgame. There is grind but it's the fun type of grind because you're helping other people and being awesome.Pro tip for new players Don't attack monsters with your face.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
2018-08-11,0,0,141,False,Not Recommended,After you get to fighting elder dragons the game drops in enjoyment levels astronomically. All monsters will not fight you but will stun you constantly instead of letting you play the game. Its so incredibly frustrating for the monster to constantl stun you and kill you while you aren't able to move. In the 50 minutes you are allowed to fight the monster 40 of them are spent holding your on the ground or chasing the flying bastard hoping you can do some petty damage before time runs out. Not to mention the disconnects still happen no matter how good everyone's connection is. The bosses are so pathetically designed and anti fun it's a joke.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

If this were some indie game worth 15 20 bucks I would not care. But for a game this big I expected a better complete experience. Last time I am pre ordering a game. They fixed most of the bugs. Takes some time to get used to the controls and they added a helluva lot of content over time. So worth it. Grind is real though.

Whats my biggest gripe? 2 days after I rebought the game it goes on sale. Pros fun simple gameplay but with some mechanics that get challenging. Crafting and customization is rather in depth. Monsters are genuinely interesting. Weapons (like my favortie hammer) are hilariously oversized. Solid job on the atmosphere and eco systems. Lotta herbivores and small animals and just predators and monsters everywhere. Cons godawful acting and writing in these games but I expect it at this point. Graphics seem subpar to me.

2019-01-21,0,0,146,False,Recommended,Monster Hunter World is a great game and a masterful first crack at the Western market on Capcom's behalf. Sure there's a bit of a steep learning curve with the combat mechanics and maybe some of the design choices could be considered a bit idiosyncratic or redundant (looking at you Gathering Hub) but the sheer amount of fun and satisfaction you get while hunting monsters overshadows all of its flaws. Each of the 14 weapon types have their own unique playstyle every monster has its own cool mechanics and behaviors and every armor set has an interesting (if not a little over the top) aesthetic.

MHW will take patience time and a determined mindset. there are many side quests to do if you are bored wanting that last piece of your set or just wanting to play with friends. there are also many events crossovers with other games and even DLC coming out soon. multiplayer is okay some of the time but you will crash a lot. overall its a good game i would suggest to anyone looking for a game to play for hours or looking to sever some tails.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

Sure at launch there were connection issues but it wasnt unplayable back then and now its almost not existant.the only harsh thing to say about mhw is that the monster variety and the decoration grinding system could be better but i hope that will make the cut in iceborne which im very hyped about.all in all 4 out of 5 for me. keep it up capcom.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2019-02-08,0,0,260,False,Recommended,If you've ever played a Monster Hunter game you understand what you're getting into.The difference being this is the most immersive addition to the franchise. Especially when played on a proper or overpowered PC with a curved monitor and surround sound headphones. I swear on the $5 to my name if anyone plays this game for the first time with half of what I mentioned they will have a lot of fun and thrilling fights for quite a few hours.Currently for PC there's enough content for at least 150 250 hours of game play before the game feels even a little stale. (depending on how much you grind)Then what keeps the fire going is the fact that new content is being released consistently so it's beyond a solid game now.Additionally there are plenty of fun fighting events to collect special gear from other games like Devil May Cry Megaman and Final Fantasy. So thats a huge bonus in my book nothing else quite like hunting a dragon with my moogle.

2019-02-12,0,0,16,False,Recommended,10/10This game is an absolute example of grinding and hating yourself. If you are a anti social like me you will realize that Dark Souls Bosses are way easier than some of this game monsters. Prepare to hate yourself for fainting in the same corner 3 times in a row by a monster that keeps repeating the same attack. Prepare to heal and be hit by the monster with twice the life you healed as damage.Prepare to scream and cry and do lower level monsters to be able to forge and upgrade an armor set just to have a chance with the monster that keeps kicking your butt. It's really hard to play solo not impossible tho. They should have let you see other players on the map so you can ask for help not just in one area of it because nobody goes there. You can send an S.O.S. flare so other players can join you if a monster is too hard but be prepared because nobody will come in your help. At least nobody came in mine.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-08-20,0,0,196,False,Not Recommended,Let's ignore the issues that set this release apart from the consoles for a second and focus on the meat the game. Instead of bite sized areas we have open lanscapes that support a believable ecosystem. Gathering points are much easier to gather from but are more spread out waiting times between areas are gone but you have to run much further between zones. Not to mention there's always scoutflies up and ready to insult your intelligence though it definitely helps on the cluster that is the Ancient Forest. Monsters treat every zone as territory leading to conflicts that are fun to watch at first. Later (especially when Bezelgeuse starts constantly invading quests) turf wars become incredbly annoying and dangerous halting combat combat being what really makes the game shine. Unfortunately it seems like a lot of the changes in MHW come at a compromise. It's good to see that they took the combat improvements from 4U and added even more mechanics though. Anyways the open world doesn't really bother me more good than harm was done there. I can't recommend this game because it really wasn't all that fun. I feel like I put the time in just to complete it. This issue stems from the fact that the new monsters just aren't very interesting or fun to fight. I think they did a great job with the elder dragons especially Nergigante but when it comes to other additions I can't think of many monsters I want to fight again. There are a few exceptions Tobi Kadachi Bezelgeuse and Legiana are more involving and challenge your ability to dodge Odogaron feels like wasted potential though his attacks are too precise making them too easy to dodge he is a less interesting Tobi. Diablos and the Rath couple return but they're barely changed. The rest of the monsters are boring punching bags because they hardly pose a threat and/or are easy to evade. Once you have endgame gear this is even more daunting nothing besides elder dragons will challenge you.Edit Servers are still complete garbage,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

It is a solid monster hunter experience and I hope we'll get more aesthetically pleasing weapons when the Iceborne expansion is released.If you enjoy Monster Hunter games then you've probably already bought this game but if you haven't... what are you waiting for?Tobi Wan Kedachi outta 10 best game 1959,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2019-02-14,0,0,301,False,Recommended,Product received for free. One of the best games I have played in 2018. The wealth of content is enough to keep me going for hours. It is a bit overwhelming at first with the menus and all the items you can take but after a while you start to get used it. The co op is the best part where the game allows you to queue up with up to 4 people on a single quest. Or you can go at it alone. It's honestly a lot more fun to play with if you have friends. I rarely run into connectivity issues and finding my friends lobbies is a breeze if you have half a brain. This game also gets free monthly updates where they have events that collaborate with other Capcom franchises such as Mega Man and Street Fighter. They also collaborated with Square Enix and CD Projekt Red to bring Final Fantasy and The Witcher into the game too! On top of all this there are harder versions of monsters that you can fight called arch tempered monsters which add another layer of replayability to the game along with new armor sets to beef up your character. I want to tell you more but to be honest it is something you have to experience for yourself. Trust me when I say that you will not disappointed in this game.

2019-02-15,0,0,140,False,Recommended,Monster Hunter World if you haven't guessed is the newest installment in the long running Monster Hunter series. Side note is Monster Hunter THAT popular in Japan that it's basically their Call of Duty except with less scumbag exploitation and more teeth grinding boss fights?Anyway if you've heard of the Monster Hunter games or even tried a few but maybe didn't take a shine to the combat for any variety of reasons (no momentum to the attacks made them feel pretty awful hit or miss and your character kept planting themselves in place to swing so you could get swiped) this is bound to be the game that wins you over. It certainly won my heart over the course of a week around Christmas I managed to clock over 40 hours on this game usually 10+ hours per sitting.The game has given major overhauls to many key systems to make them less irritating and more modern. For one you can actually move around during combat and make attacks at the same time giving you much more of a chance to dodge without making huge sacrifices to your damage output. The Sword and Shield and Dual Blades are the most mobile weapons in the game bar none and will allow you to dance around the monster taking potshots so I'd recommend those as your starters.Next items. There's a radial menu now that has 4 sub menus you can assign items and quick chat phrases to the slots for quick access in the midst of combat. (Though I will admit that I scroll using LB + B / X since it feels more precise) You can now move while using most items which can allow you to heal up while making a necessary retreat. Or better yet keep chasing the monster you're hunting while also refreshing your Demondrug and Armorskin buffs so that you're ready to fight when you corner it.Speaking of movement no more eight directional garbage. Omnidirectional movement with realistic momentum is in and it feels wonderful. Your character feels like they have mass and momentum when sprinting full tilt which can carry into your weapon swings for a sudden charge attack or help you to away from an agitated Rathalos that's none too happy about having his tail severed. You're going to be doing a LOT of running around in this game so you're going to learn very quickly whether the movement is up to your standards. If it is then it's a surprising joy just to run around and test out all the different ways to navigate the environments.Next level design. The levels are exquisitely designed mini sandboxes that have dynamic A.I. creatures roaming around and many hazards that can help you during your hunts. There are quite a few to explore and you'll likely be intimately familiar with them after playing for a while the Ancient Forest Wildspire Wastes Coral Highlands Rotten Vale and Elder's Recess. The Ancient Forest is well a massive multi level forest that teems with life around every corner and much of it is quite hostile. The Wildspire Wastes are sprawling deserts sharing space with a surprisingly lively swamp and multiple muddy oases. I'll let you discover the rest they're all visual and auditory treats with lots of wildlife to find and carve.What else? Probably worth mentioning that the game is very much a slow burn and requires quite a grind to get your weapons. While the materials might seem really easy to gather early on (some Iron Ore claws from slain Jagras so on) they start getting much rarer and much more of them will be required as you progress. Tier 8 weapons are especially nightmarish to build up to usually requiring at least one or two Gems (extremely rare drops that come in a wide variety many monsters have a unique Gem type) and tens of multiple materials to complete. Also plenty of dosh so be sure to farm money using your Bandit Mantle early on.Conclusion Monster Hunter World is a game that simply doesn't do quick gratification but when you get invested into the game you'll find that it's really hard to pull yourself away. You'll find yourself telling yourself that you'll stop playing after you hunt that Teostra that's been smearing you across the pavement and obtain that much coveted Gem. Before long it'll be 6 AM and you'll have crafted two Tier 8 weapons a new Tier 8 Charm and a brand new set of Tier 8 armor all while wondering where the hours went.It's a game I will sing the praises of despite the many flaws it has simply because the game is so absorbing that I forget what bothered me about it. Even when getting cheap shotted by Lunastra over and over I find myself getting vengeful which is a little bit different from mad or frustrating. See with the latter I start to consider Alt F4'ing the game and playing something else just to calm down. When a game makes me vengeful I'll cuss like a sailor and yell about how unfair it is in the moment but it makes me want to play MORE just to teach the game who's in charge.At $60 it's a bit of a tough sell (as any game is these days $60 is a major asking price) but even for just a 20 25% discount I would say give this Monster Hunter game a try. The game only gets better with friends so if you have pals playing it this is one of the best co op games ever made.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2018-10-21,0,0,80,False,Not Recommended,"37 Hours in A strange creature itself I would recommend it but with some very heavy caveats. It has aspects of the adrenaline fueled Hack n Slash action games like Devil May Cry with the slower paced planned combat of Dark Souls with the strategy and planning elements of chess while having you picking up everything that isn't nailed down like an MMORPG. Completely new to the series after playing Toukiden 2 playing with a controller What I feel it does right Graphics The game is stunningly beautiful so far with the noted exception of some areas in the Coral Highlands (the third full play area you encounter) where they start using some odd opacity/normal map combinations that are too low res and with jarring bump information that stands out like a sore thumb. But strictly in terms of model and textures the game looks amazing. How they actually use those assets though... more on that later Thematic Design Mix Swiss Family Robinson with The Flintstones and a pinch of Final Fantasy. Pulleys and airships and rifles but it consistnely looks like either rough worked metals and natural materials or made directly from the parts of the creatures that you are hunting. Some of the character art pushes the limits even within those bizarre circumstances such as the Barroth armor set for your Palico (NPC helper) and the Rathian set for your hunter but overall they keep the artistic syle consistent and it goes a long way to making it feel like a consistent world Rewarding Preparation and Hunting choices Not only is there plenty of loot to beat out of the local wildlife but there's something to be said about acertaining what you need in order to advance figuring out what monster drops it then deciding how to prepare for the hunt. WIll you need to be constantly stunning the monster? Is your drop rate higher if you kill the monster or capture it? How active are they when engaged in combat? What elemental alignment do they have? What gear do you have that counters that? What weapon has the best counter to the monster's moveset and exploits their elemental weakness? Having all those choices translate into how your hunts play out is very rewarding and has a substantial impact on how you learn and improve in the game. It's a Japanese port without most of the drawbacks While the English VO seems minimal at times there aren't many of the japanese/anime tropes that usually stand out and potentially drive away people who have a strong aversion to those aspects of Japanese ports. The only one that comes up is the Law of Inverted Armor Coverage to Armor Value that you typically get with female characters with some of them creeping close to ""provocative"" but again it's quite minimal. One more hunt... It's very grindy but since it allows you (and often rewards you) for vearing off to investigate new areas and collect new materials as you are hunting it can get very addictive.Where I feel it misses RAGE (salt) Consistency Monsters will fight each other... except when they don't and they double stomp you.Calico Ally will attack the monster you're fighting... except when it won't. (typically standing by you luring the monster to level strilkes at you while you're standing up or trying to fire from range)You can use shock/pitfall traps to confine the monster then tranq them with bombs or bullets to capture them... unless you can't.And if situations arise where the fight becomes too drawn out each of them is also on a timer that allows them to run away and deny you any rewards you haven't already collected (which is typically the majority).There is a separate reward pool for capturing a monster but your gear limites you to three attempts per mission because there is no way to access your main inventory while in the field. Just to re iterate you can carry the materials for 20 max potions hundreds of rounds of ammunition hundreds of assorted bones berries etc. But you can only carry three traps into the field.So much is going on ""behind the scenes"" that would be useful information in the actual UI. Such as having AI callouts for when a monster can be slept or mounted or is about to retreat would be immensely useful but whereas they can give you menus upon menus of useless information these are left by the wayside. The number of times that I've relentlessly released attacks on a monster ""in the red"" burning through all my traps to no effect and being forced to kill the monster losing any chance at the item I was looking to farm because it's ""capture only"" and not wanting to have the time spent in vain vs the times that I've had a monster go from ""yellow"" to dead in an instant is infuriating.Monsters like the Anjanath (which appears far too early imo) Diabalos and Deviljho are the size of busses but without the deliberate telegraphed moves that suggests.There are times that the game plays well and is unreservedly enjoyable but then at others it feels like a chore if not a punishment as you fight against the whims of a cruel ""dungeonmaster"". UI Some of the UI elements in particular the crafting menus for someone coming into the MH series for the first time are initially nightmarish. When you take into account that you will most likely need several sets of armor and a few weapon types dependant on playstyle as well as different builds for each of those weapon families as well as managing the materials needed to craft ammunition ammunition modifiers and traps leaving things as raw and unstreamlined as they did does not come across as intuitive at all and only 37 hours did I start to acclimate. The ""scoutflies"" that hightlight a path to your target along with (occasionally) items of interest in world are not only inconsistent but at times confusing and unclear which can be said for a number of icons and ""flags"" that you will have to either google or learn by trial and error. It may be an acquired taste but right now it's a bitter one. Given that this is the 11th iteration of the main series one would expect that the rough edges had been smoothed away the interface to be intuitive and the systems streamlined. That simply doesn't seem to be the case prioritizing familiarity over innovation. Story/Narrative There is none. Well there is it's just so skin deep that it can be summed up in a single paragraph and most people I imagine could guess at the nuances if not guess it entirely after a couple of hours. The characters don't seem to have have any personal story arcs or development of any kind and some of the dialogue deliveries are either clunky and don't match the tone (the Handler NPC you get paired up with ocilates between being a heedless idiot and an overexhuberant airhead) or hamfistedly launch into exposition into their ""backstory"" or the games narrative. I imagine quite a bit can be forgiven if you have a history with the series but since that's not the case for me it feels like it was put in just to tick a box on the GDD. A fun time sink although new players to the series may want to either test out a previous entry or a similar game such as Toukiden (which I found to have much stronger and pervasive narative and character elements) before commiting to this game. I haven't experienced the network connection issues that many of the negative reviews mention. The formulaic combat that allows you some space to embellish and experiment with different approaches is nice but don't try it expecing a constant adrenaline rush as it has its own deliberate pacing which may be a turnoff to some people. A Strategy/Action game which leans much more heavily to the strategy elements and requires deliberate planning and execution of attacks to get the most out of time spent playing it.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2019-02-09,0,0,77,False,Recommended,Monster Hunter World is 2018s Game of the Year in my eyes.I'm a huge fan of the Monster Hunter series and have been playing since 4 Ultimate World is a fantastic game. everything from the monsters environments animations designs etc. This game is very different from its older siblings good and bad.Going off good I love the open world environments. No longer having to go in and out of loading zones is fantastic. The world really feels alive. The AI is also better as monsters are now able to fight each other palicos are more helpful (for the most part). Movement and controls are so much better. The heavy weapons feel heavy combos are more easily and fun to pull off bowguns are so much more fun. The weapon tree is a great addition and skills are better.But this game isn't perfect. I don't like how some of the weapons designs are the same but with only a few things changed mostly for the bowguns. Limited time events are dumb as in the older games they stayed forever. Limited amount of monsters (but I can see why so i'm not really disappointed). Palico customization is limited. (The older games had palico support types and skills you could customize). No snowy environment (but Iceborne is coming so lets wait and see how that works out.)There's more good and bad things I can say but the good outweighs the bad by a large margin. If you are a fan of the Monster Hunter series get this game. If you are new and interested get this game.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2019-02-09,0,0,86,False,Recommended,A year late review of Monster Hunter WorldIt s been a year for Monster Hunter World since it first came out on PS4. After 800 hours on PS4 I can say this is the game that I love the most. To start off I m not a Japanese games lover so when I started I didn t give it my full attention which this game might be my next kind of Try and Drop game. But later I got hooked on the action and it exceeded my expectation in every way. The game is basically you kill the monsters get the materials craft better gears fight harder monsters replay it until you master your weapons and dominate the monsters. The grinding is real but the rewards are worth your time. When you finally figured out how to beat a monster that you ve been struggling for a long time that s when you figured out how satisfying the game is.GraphicsThis game looks gorgeous everything is perfect and detailed. Also the performance is absolutely beast I rarely seen any hiccups or lags either. Furthermore the monsters are very detailed it has footprints and different features like special animation moves patterns auras etc. I have to say that this is the most polished Monster Hunter I've ever played.Gameplay The game has plenty of weapons to choose from so you won t get bored in anytime soon. Each of them has different playstyle and requires time &amp dedication to master it. The combos are pretty amazing some of them are based on the previous Monster Hunter game but this time they expanded it furthermore with much more useful &amp complex attack skills. Take Long Sword as an example now we have a more detailed Fade Slash and we can also do a following up Spirit Blade to build up the gauge. Not just that Helm Breaker is an absolute beast skill to use where it jumps up and ends with a high damage slash. In addition there is a skill called Foresight Slash . It s very hard to use and requires you to be in a mid combo. After a while you will figure out the monster s patterns it gives you a sense when the monster's going to roar or attack you so that you can use Foresight to dodge it and gain spirit gauge faster. Not just LS but the other weapons also has special/new moves that gives you advantage if you know how to use it correctly/timingly. For instance Guard Point of Charge Blade if you do it at the right time it can knock the monster out with KO damage just like LS s Foresight Slash it will dodge the attack and you won t lose any health. Each weapon has an important role in some situation. There is no perfect weapon or the best weapon to choose but in some cases some weapons might give you an advantage over the others. For example If I want to play safely I would choose charge blade or gunlance which give me a shield to straight up dodge the attack easier than using LS s Foresight Slash or if I want to play aggressively then LS or Dual Blades would deal much higher damage or if I want to attack the monster at a distance then Bow would be a better choice.RPG aspectThe weapons have different paths to upgrade depends on the monster and the elements. It has different element to choose from Ice Thunder Dragon Fire Raw damage etc. Most of the monster will have different weaknesses and if you choose the best one it would extract the most damage out of it. For example I mostly go with raw damage (no element) since I m kind of lazy to change up everything and raw damage is perfect for most of the situations. When you fight Elder Dragons they have a special feature called Elder Seal which is their special aura abilities that protect themselves and enable them to enrage some special moves. So if you use a weapon that has Elder Seal from Medium to High it will suppress the Elders special skills. For example Nergigante has a special move called Dive Bomb that it flies up and tries to kamikaze into you causing high amount of damage or maybe instant kill. If you or your friends use High elder seal weapons it will take a longer time to regrowth its nails on the back (a sign to tell when it s going to use the special ability) and the ability to do the Dive Bomb . So if your team doesn t have any weapons with ES you will see its nails go black faster and do dive bomb more frequently. That s the reason why you must have the patience and time to understand the monsters the patterns/features where its roams where its sleep etc. On the other hand the monsters are also very balanced you might feel overwhelming at the beginning but after a while you will eventually get it.The last part would be the core reason of the game decoration grinding and different armors/weapons grinding.The armor system is pretty good where you need to mix different monster s armors to gain the best skills out of it. Each armor has different skills to go along with it the upgrade will just be for the base armor stat which help you withstand the damage from the monster s attack and nothing else. So the best build is the one with great skills set not with a high armor number. Some weapons require specific skills set to make it better so you might want to grind for multiple monsters to build the best one that is suitable with your weapons. For example Long Sword requires high affinity and damage to be able to get the best out of Helm Breaker skill so Nergigante s helm might be the best helm because it has 2 Maximum Might skill and 1 Attack skill. Maximum Might give you more affinity (Crit Chance) while your stamina is at full. But for dual blade this skill is useless when most of the attacks/combos require high usage of stamina and barely be able to keep full stamina for a long time like Long Sword s players. That s the reason why you need to build a set for each weapon specifically. The other way to obtain skills is to use decoration and put it on the armor. The higher rarity the decorations are the better skills it gives. Also different decoration gems have different level (size) and only fit to the same size or bigger to be able to use it. The size ranging from 1 to 3 with 1 is the smallest and 3 is the largest. For example Attack skill gem is only size 1 Critical Boost is size 2 Handicraft is size 3. The armors will have different gem slot with different sizes. Decorations are very hard to find which the rarest will or might only appear in tempered threat level 3 monsters fight and of course it won t be easy and the result is also based on RNG which you might have to replay a thousand times just to get a second Attack Gem. But as I said the reward is very satisfying and this is one of the reasons. To be able to build the perfect set with the perfect decorations it will take you hundred of hours to complete it.Pros Developers are constantly updating the contents. Ice Borne DLC is coming and I can t wait for it. Other DLCs are just cosmetic and stickers to chat with the others. It s an option and you don t have to buy it. I just want to support the developers a cup of coffee for this awesome game and also be able to get something for myself.Cons You/your friends must watch the cutscene to be able to join others. Snap Head during fight when the monster appears. People leaves mid battle the monster s health is still scaled and the others are not able to join.TL DR Fight the monsters. Failed. Try Again. Replay it. Get better gears. Try it again. Killed the monsters. Advance to higher monsters. Master the weapons. Build the best set. Try out different weapons. Find the best decorations. Dominate.I would gladly give this game 10/10 and this is my personal 2018 GOTY. It s been a great year so far and with the Iceborne DLC is coming I might be able to put in another 1000 hours in 2019.https //steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id 1649814757https //steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id 1649814674,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

The game plays like they just slapped on an emulator nothing like a games should be playing if you spent half a year getting it ready for PC. As most people have noticed the framerates are low and unstable on even high end graphics cards. No support for ultrawide 21 9 screens. The mouse and keyboard controls are very unintuative and basically just a controller remapping. The game also crashed on my second hunt. Includes Denovo which is another downside to actual paying customers. Not recommended until they fixes these problems.

2019-02-15,0,0,175,False,Recommended,Feels like a cross between Dark Souls and WoW. Not as punishing as Dark Souls but this game isnt for the faint of heart.This was my first time playing a game in the Monster Hunter series. I would highly recommend playing through as much of the campaign solo as you can. Playing alone helped me learn from my mistakes and get a better feel for both monster mechanics and the attack patterns of my weapon.I found the multiplayer in this game to be the best and worst part of this game. Playing alongside a skilled and/or experienced player can be a great learning opportunity. Watch how they dodge attacks where they attack the monster and how they use terrain/traps to their advantage. Unfortunately playing with new players can be quite frustrating. You are only allowed a fixed number of deaths per mission and an unprepared player can cause you to fail a mission you would normally be able to complete solo. While exploring multiplayer I recommend focusing on survival to be polite (practice the monster solo first come prepared with potions don't take risks etc).Some tips I wish I knew when I started *Melee weapons take less physical damage but more elemental damage (ranged weapons are reversed) *High elemental resistance prevents blights (high fire resist prevents you from catching on fire)*Always upgrade your armor! Cool skills arent worth a loss of defense when you are learning (dead hunter zero damage)*You can use traps to disable monsters even if you don't intend to capture them*Some attacks have invulnerability frames allowing you to 'block' monster attacks*Breaking monster parts provide you with extra rewards*Don't be afraid to change weapons (some weapons are ill suited for certain monsters),MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2019-02-16,0,0,136,False,Recommended,As and og mh player (mhfu mhf) at first i didn't liked how the game was made. The exploration was weird also the tracking and research thing. The multiplayer seemed pretty bad cause you can only join different sessions with max of 16 players per session and the only place they are visible is the gathering hall or in quest (ofc). You can hardly interact with anyone on this game so i'd say it's more single player based which isn't something new for mh. So if you're looking out for the multiplayer it's not quite the game but still if you've got buddies to play with it can get really really fun. The storyline is about 100h of gameplay and after you complete it there is still a lot you can do. There are new collabs (witcher &lt 3) and events constantly for new gear or layered armor (costumes). The gameplay allows flexibility with different types of weapons with different mechanics to master and you don't have to grind that much to get new weapons or armor. The game seems pretty easy at first but as you reach the lategame you find yourself getting oneshotted pretty often without the right build or skills. In the end i found myself liking the game a lot and i'd say it's worth it. You can still have a lot of fun with friends while tasting the classic mh experience.ESCANOR APPROVES!!,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

2017-08-15,12,530,2780,False,Recommended,One of the best cRPG out there if you are a fan of roleplaying games this is definitely a must buy. For those who never play thier first game no worries although they take places in a same universe each has a standalone story. This one starts thousand years after the first one so you are not missing anything. One of best thing about DOS 2 is it gameplay. It's turn based slow paced but really interactive with many different elemental combinations cool interactions between each abilities and your surrounding environmental even statuses are interesting. For some examples you can create some nasty chain explosive reactions with a combo of Fire and Poison any kind of liquid (water/blood/poison/...) left on the battleground can reacted to Air turning it into a pool of Electricity deal damage and stun anyone in it. Buffs/debuffs status usually do more than one thing and may interact with eachother Stone Armor not only increase your physical armor but also stop you from bleeding/burning because you are solid rock. Peace Of Mind is the kind of ability that let you see a bigger pictures it provides stats buff and cure Blindness BUT also remove frenzy status Rage because the target have become more wise so no more bold actions. Rage on the otherhand is also another status which increase damage output but at a great cost of defense down. Surrounding environmental also plays a great part in your game say if someone go invisible and there is happen to be raining that sneaky guy will be revealed because he's wet. And because water react violently with electricity he will be taking increased Air damage but will take less damage if you throw a fireball at him. Walking through frozen ground and you may trip and get knocked down. Standing on high ground will make your spells/abilities/items reach further with increased damage. Talents in game open up your playstyles depend on what you pick. Lone Wolf or One Man Army does what it says for who want to go solo Leech turn you into a vampire allowing you to heal when standing near blood or Zombie make Poison heal you instead but normal healing will damage you. Because the game is classless you can be anyone mix and match anything you like you may be born a warrior but dream to be a mage go learn some magic and become a battlemage. Who says warrior can't be sneaky go ahead and get yourself some rogue abilities... Divinity Original Sin 2 also offer you really great roleplaying experience it has a great balance between combat and talking with rich dialogues and occasional silly humors. You can play as different races Human Elf Dwarf Undead and Lizard..yeah thats' right you can become a Lizard that spits out Fire. Each races have different racial skill and special power NPCs may also react/talk differently to you depend on your race. There are also different original characters ingame who have thier own story goals and personalites for you to play but if you want to create your own character the game also offer many different origins which called tags Soldier Scholar Outlaw ..etc which plays a part in dialogue. The Origins will remain in your game as companion and you can have different perspective on them through dialogues/questline which is really cool imo there is also a relationship system ingame (not fully included in EA will be in full game) which can create intense rivalry friendship enmity and romance! Visually the game looks great it's colorful most of the times and can be dark when needed to be infact the DOS 2 is meant to be darker and much more focused than the previous one. Having finished Act 1 in EA there are no fetch quests and unrelated to the storyline all of them is connected one way or another each tell you a story about the game's world and ultimately leading to a bigger picture. You can finish quests in different ways any path is a progression you'll never feel getting stuck there are always different paths to take things to do. Oh a maze i'm not in the mood to solve puzzle atm let's jump/fly through it dont have wings? Look around there's maybe some other hidden paths/shortcut or go do some questline maybe some of them will shed some lights of the Maze making it easier to go through. Crafting is in game (duh..! obviously it's an cprg game) and it's RICH. Just look up the crafting list in DOS 1 and before there were just a combination of two items in DOS 2 you can have a combination of total 5 items. Here comes the great part you can craft new skills by combining books of different schools. You can turn a normal rain into a mean blood storm. Mixing a Pryo spell with Necromancy you can make corpses explode dealing massive damage to nearby targets as if you cutting thier buddies down wasn't enough.. There are alot more cool features ingame but i won't include them all in this small review. So i'll add one more thing that may get some people excited There will be a Game Master Mode! which have up to 5 players in total which include 4 main players and 1 GM. Allowing you to create your own worlds and adventure with friends the devs also offer alot of tools for easier time making your own dungeon you can control anything the stats the weather music dialouges events ..etc and you can even do it on the fly!

Negatives It's been a fair bit since I played but I had an issue finishing a companion quest that was tied into the same NPC as another companion I had. Once completed one companion was stuck and could not progress. I ended up finishing the game without completing it. A few bugs here and there but nothing gamebreaking. Most notably in ""The Arx"". There was one house with locked doors in which you could run right through them.

2018-03-02,39,146,136,False,Recommended,"Divinity Original Sin 2 is like playing a very enthusiastic Dungeon Master's homebrew campaign. Said DM really fell in love with the cosmology and deities section of the Dungeon Master's Guide as well as the idea of creating an epic REALLY LONG arc where his players eventually achieve godhood. Mr. DM also put an awful lot of time into fleshing out his world and making sure you know that HIS elves are DIFFERENT (they EAT people and get their MEMORIES see) though for some reason he decided to keep his dwarves Scottish.This DM is not perfect and has his faults. For one he really loves throwing environmental effects all over the battlefield to the point of it becoming annoying. Fire spreads 50 feet in an arc! Now ice shoots out over the fire! Now smoke and lighting and tentacles spread atop the fire and ice! Yeah! Near the end of the campaign his planning starts to slip both in combat design and in lore. For instance he offers his players a variety of different endings to their grand adventure but none of them are all that great and one gets the feeling that he randomly chose the final boss by just flipping through the Monster Manual with the intent of picking a Challenge Rating 30 beastie just to tell his other DM friends that ""I PUT MY PLAYERS UP AGAINST THIS GUY ONCE AND THEY KIND OF SURVIVED!""

I adored the first one. I'm worshippping the second.This isn't a game that'll hold your hand this isn't a game that's easy and laid back. This is the game that throws you in the middle of a world and tells you to figure it out. It has multiple difficulty settings so if tactical turnbased combat isn't your strongest suit there ARE easier modes for you! But the harsh combat isn't the only thing that makes this game hard. It's the quests the world there is NO handholding. You got to figure out what to do you got to figure out which quest to solve and focus on. And boy are there many quests to focus on!Some seem absolutely random some seem like just a typical sidequest kind of job that ends up being the key ingredient in solving the big mystery! I love that I love that the first act has you stuck on an island a jail and your job is to break out. And how would one do this? There isn't just one way or two or three. There are more than that. Way more. And it's up to you to figure out the way. There are five races human dwarf elf lizard and undead. Each brings with their own talents and experience in the game. You might have trouble with certain quests because they hate your race you might need to find another way into a town because they don't like dwarves. It's extremely immersive and playing it as a coop makes it even so. I'm not sure I have words to describe to you how amazing this game is. I like difficult games I played this on Tactical which is hard and on some boss fights me and my coop partner would sit here for two hours. Reloading. Repositioning. Changing skills. Reloading. over and over untill we finally managed to beat said boss. It was one of the most amazing experiences I've had in gaming all year. Just that little bit of having to figure out how something works.There are Character Tags and Talents that you can choose that really makes this into an immersive rpg. Pet Pal allows you to talk to animals. That sad dog over there cheer him up and he'll help you. That nasty fire elemental? Guess what! She needs your help!You can have a talent that makes you stink and people dislike you because of it. Larian Studios is a dev team to follow. I cannot wait to see what comes next.(Voice acting wasn't in the original budget.

Larian Studios actually ditched their publisher and switched to crowd funding because they forced them to make and launch the game the way they didn't want it that should tell you enough.)Larian Studios as a Belgian I can say you make us proud.Please keep doing what you're doing never succumb to the attitude most major developers and publishers have it'd be a huge loss in the game industry.,Divinity: Original Sin 2 - Definitive Edition
2018-10-17,2,115,120,False,Recommended,A masterpieceIt took me around 100 hours to finish the game.The world of Rivellon is both big and alluring. It was a joy to explore every single corner of it.Each battle was challenging fun made me use different tactics and I never got tired of fighting. The game balances roleplaying and combat perfectly. In some RPGs the combat is fine but the story and characters are what keep you playing. However in Original Sin 1 I didn't really care for the story while Original Sin 2 kept me interested at all times. It really improves on the lore roleplaying and combat.It's definitely a good sequel and one of the best games of 2017.I only have two complaints Romance had no effect on the ending and the amount of puzzles in the game.It would have taken me A LOT more than 100 hours to finish the game because of the puzzles. Now don't get me wrong. The puzzles are all interesting and well executed. There are some simple puzzles moderate and very hard ones. I just don't have too much time to play video games and since there are so many puzzles in the game I had to resort to using Google way more than I'd like to admit. Now the romance and with it some minor spoilers ahead. I decided to romance Lohse. At the end of the game she asked me if I would like to travel the world with her and I can't answer her. All I can do is end the conversation and in the final cutscene the narrator tells me that she spent the rest of her life traveling Rivellon alone. Just dissapointing.But what is the game about? What's the story like?You have the ability to use Source A powerful and outlawed magic.Magic used by the gods themselves. It's what gives them power.The game starts with you being captured by Magisters who hunt and imprison everyone who can use Source. They take you to an isolated prison island. While there you make new friends discover an unbelievable truth about yourself and make interesting alliances while trying to escape the island. You will meet dragons witches paladins underground fighting arenas demons trolls ghosts and much much more.You will also uncover conspiracies and astonishing secrets. Will you be the new Divine?The game itself plays alot like the recent XCOM games. It's basically a turn based roleplaying game. Not to worry tho. You can still create a custom character and choose their stats race gender and origin story or you can simply choose one of the pre made characters. There's a wide variety of classes to choose from as well. All your favourate melee ranged and magic classes are there. It also has Steam Workshop and modders have made some really interesting class mods that are worth checking out. However if you enable mods you are not able to earn achivements. This in my humble opinion is a bit foolish. It's a singleplayer game and I should be allowed to have my fun however I want. The trainers still work and it has no leaderboards in it so I don't really support disabling achivements for mod users. It's a minor complaint but a complaint nonetheless.The game is well optimised and ran at a solid 60 frames per second at all times. I did experience two crashes during my playthrough but other than that I really didn't notice any other bugs or issues. Visually the game is lovely to look at and the soundtrack is marvelous. Don't go into it expecting remarkable next gen graphics though.It's a game I most definitely won't forget any time soon. I want a sequel and I want it now!A must play for every roleplaying fan and fans of the turn based genre should give it a go as well.Well done Larian Studios well done.,Divinity: Original Sin 2 - Definitive Edition

2017-09-30,0,0,183,False,Recommended,Be very very carefull with this game this game is not as versatile as its sound game complex mechanics favor towards certains abilities build and less favorable to another. What i means is in the higher difficulty setting some abilities becoming less effective compared to another greatly limiting your playstyle with the illusions of freedoms pick wrong abilities and you will be forced for a hit and run style involving a lot of escape to nearby waypoint.I think the greatest problem is lies in the fact that Larian studio hand crafted each fight encounter so certain fight felt kinda wonky when some enemies group get free move for several turn without any clear explanation (triggered event). Certain decisions also killed another quest automatically unknown to our knowledge resulting in loss of bonus xp ( example if you already fighting in harbor before reaching sanctuary of amadia then some people will died and no found way to prevent that)I still greatly recommend this game for this game but feeling it will be better with a lot of improvement.

2017-09-27,0,0,52,False,Recommended,Amazing RPG very engrossing in all aspects. Great story likeable characters combat makes you think and decent loot system. Two big gripes about the game1. Loot progression is somewhat borked. It's not very noticeable mid game but early (levels 1 5) and lategame items (levels 18 to 20) are extremely level dependent. Even Divine/Unique level 18 gear is sometimes not worth keeping over merely rare level 20 gear as the raw defensive or offensive stats are simply subpar. Same goes for early game gear. You won't be able to fight necessary enemies to progress through an area without equipping your party with a certain level of weapons (actual rarity doesn't seem to matter). 2. Awful skill bar managment. Not customizable and gets extremely cluttered in the midgame to endgame. Newly acquired skills seemingly fill up whatever blank spot is left on the bar. Need some options to customize what goes on the bar and what does not.,Divinity: Original Sin 2 - Definitive Edition

2017-06-08,0,0,24,True,Recommended,It's a fun game with a decent story and lots of variety on abilities.That being said it's still in Alpha (at the time of this review) and lots needs to change.The game is extremely unbalanced so if you like sitting around and watching the enemy attack you without you getting any turns for 4 to 10 rounds then you'll enjoy this game.The enemies have the same powers and abilities as your team and will use them to freeze stun poison and generally prevent you from attacking or making any actions against them or even at all during combat with no way to free yourself from the effects and this is on Explorer Mode.I'm looking forward to the full release and especially the game master portion of the game but as of right now it's unbalanced and far too difficult to even get off the starting island let alone enjoy the rest of the game.All that being said. I'm having fun playing it when the above noted isn't happening to me at almost every fight. Looking forward to enjoying it much more in the future.,Divinity: Original Sin 2 - Definitive Edition

The game doesn't tell you where to go or what to do it doesn't give you any feedback as far as quest progression without opening the log book and reading. There's no indicators on screen to tell you where to go for your quest. I have the game on normal and in the first area I get killed by everything even though most of it is my level or 1 higher.

We healed the injured reunited a broken family and righted many a social injustice. We were Heroes. But I didn't do it for myself I didnt do it for them. I did it for Rex. I made the world a better place for Rex. Rex was my Light Rex was my EVERYTHING. One day after a grueling session of gladitorial combat in an undergound arena I returned to the surface to show Rex my trophy. Only to find Rex's cold corpse and a group of Magisters laughing over thier kill........ I snapped.Source welled throughout my body coiled my chest and then rested in my heart until it exploded out of my hands. Out from Rex's corpse a bloody blob of flesh and puss rose. It shifted left and right and under the shocked gazes of the magisters slunk its way to my legs mewling and purring. Rex was back. My light was back. I don't know what happened afterwards. All I know is that anyone who attempts to seperate me from Rex has thier soul seperated from thier body and consumed. I am Zorp. Zorp the Vile but its Ok.

2018-05-29,4,39,120,False,Not Recommended,"I really want to write a positive review for this game so badly. I've never felt so conflicted on my feelings and my ""yes or no"" answer but right now i really can't suggest anyone buy this game.Why? Well.. it's kind of not finished. Sure you have an ending but... if you're a ""normal gamer"" then you're not going to get to it due to horrific game design that seemed to be untested.Simply put the first act is pretty ""okay"" it's fairly balanced but a little dull due to lacking abilities that are interesting. Then act 2 is pretty open there is a lot hidden and a lot going on the theme of the game shines. You get new skills story development and a fairly (most the time) balanced game. Act 3 then becomes oddly rushed.. with underwhelming endings to story arch and bizarrely easy fights. It's not the worst thing ever but it did make me feel a little concerned the game was losing direction.Then i hit act 4.... oh boy... act 4... i.. i'm not too sure how to describe the car wreck that is act 4. Simply put you start act 4 at level 19. The bosses and most of the enemies are level 20 which doesn't seem like a big deal... until you realize that the difference between that 1 level in gear is around... 200 300%. Yes... your items double/tripple in effectiveness from a single level. Unfortunately... you can't hit 20 without doing a number of quests in act 4... which results bosses just instantly killing your entire party in a single shot. I had a look online to see what the MLG pro gamers had for advice. The answers? Pretty much abuse flaws in the AI or bad balancing that helps you. There's no actual fair way to play act 4 you're supposed to abuse the game in order to progress. It's not something i want to do because i just don't think that's very fun.Act 4 simply isn't anywhere near finished or even tested. Not only is the balance an utter mess but so are the quests. Gone are your multiple options and dialogue with other npc's about your situation. Everything becomes a very finite line you MUST follow. A guy who got married on this exact day wants you to murder his new father in law the ONLY way to finish it is to do it. Not tell his wife not to get the local ""police"" involved not even to mention why in his basement is effectively 30000 tonnes of this worlds equivalent of nukes. Just no you're selling a product as if finished when it's clearly not. When act 4 is cleaned i will happily change my review.And yes i know people will tell me to git gud in response.",Divinity: Original Sin 2 - Definitive Edition
2017-10-02,0,0,172,False,Not Recommended,I really wanted to enjoy this title but I can't get into it. The new armor system is a let down. You can't even taunt targets without stripping them of all their armor points first. Magic is extremely difficult to use without risking friendly fire. Some of the fights are extremely poorly designed (ship fight between Acts 1 and 2 I'm looking at you) and the devs love to 'gotcha' by introducing enemies and elements into combat you couldn't have known about before starting the engagement (much save / reload and trial / error required). The illusion of choice is also especially bad. Basically you have the way the developers want you to solve the problem and then all the wrong ways. Feel free to select the wrong way if you want things to be more difficult. On top of those things I found the story to be an extremely typical 'you are the chosen one and only you can save the universe' tale. Some very eye rolling fondling over your character really turned me off of the plot. The individual character stories are more interesting but only make up a tiny percentage of what you'll spend your time doing which is mostly wandering around large environments looting barrels and managing your inventory. Some final notes. Crafting is a chore but at least it's completely ignorable. There's a ton of things to read but most of that is also easily ignored. You will likely feel compelled to play one of the 'origin' characters instead of making a custom character because you miss out on content if you don't. Graphics and sounds are fine but nothing really stands out as outstanding. The entire game is voice acted which is great although that voice acting is just serviceable. Lastly this is an incredibly long game which I suppose means good value to some but to me means bloat and poor pacing. Divinity lost me in Act 2 which is about half way through and I can't see myself playing another 40 50 hours of this.,Divinity: Original Sin 2 - Definitive Edition

The characters are completely static in anything but plot points which they do move through but without changing. They're also pretty much all boring archetypes the rugged mysterious Mediterranean man the psycho the elitist smarty pants the royal snob the sottish person etc. They never surprise you every time they react to anything its always exactly what you expect that boring cliché to say. The story is extremely derivative and seems like a plot a computer who copy and pasted plot elements from other famous RPGs like E. Scrolls and Drag Age could have come up with on its own. The dialogue choices are mainly about which piece of information you want to know in which order rather than actually role playing/having an effect. The only difference I really see is the game actually allows you to up if you kill a questgiver which isn't that unique.

Many many many times you will pick a wrong dialogue choice or suddenly get into a engagement with an enemy that has superior positioning get rekt and then load a previous save in order to position your party properly for a fight. Get used to saving and loading every 5 minutes because you're going to be doing it a lot. The game has many abilities and builds you can make but most of them are trash and it becomes clear that movement based abilities and crowd control abilities that take enemies out of the fight for a turn are far superior once you get a grasp of how the games combat works. Speaking of combat while Divinity 2 does appear to have a deep combat system at first it quickly becomes formulaic. Most fights start with your party getting bombarded by AOE spells getting CC'd and then having your squishes targeted. Tying into what I said above with builds having a tanky party that deals mainly physical damage is much better than having a mixed damage or magic damage based party. You are almost always starved for Exp and loot. Like that shiny new shield you just got for your tank? Well I have some bad news buddy it's going to be obsolete in a level. This also forces you into some fights you wouldn't get into otherwise because most often than not you need the experience from fighting and not fighting will leave you under leveled. While the world is flushed out and you can tell the developers put a lot of attention into detail I never really cared to learn more about it or the people inside of it. You are the chosen one on a quest to save the world from an otherworldly force. It's your typical RPG fare and comes off as lacking substance.Overall Divinity 2 isn't a bad game but it's a game targeted at a specific sort of person. I'm sure those people will have lots of fun with Divinity 2 but if any of my complaints seem like they would resonate with you you're probably going to feel as I did with Divinity 2.,Divinity: Original Sin 2 - Definitive Edition
2018-07-09,6,12,12,False,Not Recommended,"I want to like this game I truly do. The voice acting is superb the graphics detailed the mechanics... um complicated which is not everyone's ante but they do give you options (and options for those options (and sub optio ... you get the gist)). The story is well ahem there. Did I mention the voice acting and the optio ... I did huh? Anyway it's all fine for the first few hours. You're exploring the world is vastly um vast. The characters plentiful. But then ""Your enemies are more powerful than you. Consider fleeing."" happens. A lot. This is a direct qoute of the game's interface which actually and directly *tells* you that the given area/encounter/fight/building/quest/blahblah/yaddayadda will get long tiresome and frustrating. And man does it happen often. On CLASSIC friggin difficulty. Get ready to be OHK'd a lot. Every 'boss' encounter is a few levels above you unless you grind every single quest.And here lies the conundrum (wrappen in an enigma (wrapped in a pastry (wrapped in a 'whyohwhy'))). Theenemies world may be open but your choices are *not*. Want to ventrue this way on a whim carry me game world oh you open and free beast you? Nope enemies outlevel you you die. Want to skip running every errand in this town and continue your oh so mother of all epicness epic quest? Nope you have to talk to everything and do everyone (err or the other way around). Because at level 10 enemies level 12 spell doom (with a capital D capital O capital YOUWANTMORE?). This happens constantly meaning that for every larger fight you need a plan a trick a five barrels of cursed oil in your inventory contingency.It just gets tiresome.If you have the 10 hours a day to spend on a video game good for you have fun. If you don't you'll be playing this for weeks one fight at a time getting smashed by a 1000HP 250DMG per hit voidwoken vs your 100 armor crew.There's still a complex large ambitious no hand holding making you think game under the 5 boss fights per area aggravation.

2017-10-03,1,16,494,False,Not Recommended,Like the others too many RPG/Game busting bugs. Wait for Enhanced Edition/Sale/More patches. This game is bugged from beginning to the final quest (serious story broken ending bugs plenty of reporting on forums if you want to ruin it for youself but I recommend avoiding for a while).My final conclusion is to wait for a heavy discount and more patches to fix broken/bad content. My gameplay hours trump most (despite being inflated by afking with game running) but i've stuck it out and tried to report as many bugs as possible. Simply put this is great game potential yet mared by bugs everywhere (for a metric patch 3 addressed over 100 features and bugs alone many of which were known for months of early access). This makes the game as it stands very hard to enjoy as you don't know what is bugged and what is a feature. Moreover quests despite being completed correctly still flag as incomplete (and thus the game treats you as having not done the stuff you did) and this alone is tire screeching for any RPG. Features are generally much the same as D OS1 but again they feel like beta or just bad in some areas and splendid in others. Dialogue and Banter chat log feature has never once functioned to date. Some fights in game warrant explaination on wtf Larian was thinking (Dreamers Portal) and most of the status and features require trail and error to get a grasp of (Ring 6 Vitality apparently means 'this ring gives you constant healing equal to the HP from 7 constitution (and each point of constitution give 7% vitality which are your Hit Points). Personal preferences aside quite a number of 'intended features' are either frustrating (not being able to mouse over enemy debuffs to read description) or simply are broken/never made it into the game. There is a good deal number of dialogues that are only partly voiced meaning that its either more bugs (not playing voice script properly) or intended that way.Another Example The quest log (arguably important) is poorly implimented. Supposing you avoid the bugged logs it doesn't fully complete for each zone. It also updates per interaction (so if you find a boss then later find a note hinting where the boss is the note will be the top update). This results in you not knowing if the quest if still in your current Act (and thus you will miss out if you leave) or if the quest is continued in the next act. Its guessing game or risk forum spoilers.,Divinity: Original Sin 2 - Definitive Edition

2017-10-03,0,0,123,False,Not Recommended,We've run into a game breaking bug. After all the patches we've been through a game breaking bug shouldn't be present.My wife and I both have the game. Our inventories have become messed up we think. The only indicators we have are five blank spots when we go to Crafting inventory. We have even tracked down where they come from. During Driftwood you have a quest Strange Cargo to rescue a guy in a barrel. The moment you tell him to come with you he becomes part of your party. In his inventory are five grenade items. No matter what you do after that you will have blank spaces in your Crafting inventory. Whether you kill him on the spot or lead him safely out of town.You might wonder what a few missing spots would matter. As did we. But when you get ready to leave Act2 and go to Nameless Isle you'll either get kicked back out to the main menu during the cutscene or get Crash to Desktop. If you get kicked back out it gives Save Error 302.We haven't been able to get any attention on the issue. But I suspect more people may realize having the same problem as time goes on and people progress through the story. And they'll probably lose three days worth of progress like we did and really really not even want to finish the game anymore. So until this is fixed or maybe even if it does there's gonna be at least two negative reviews on this game from us.,Divinity: Original Sin 2 - Definitive Edition

2017-12-02,3,14,133,False,Not Recommended,"If you want a quality game without tons of random nuances please buy the Divinty Original Sin 1. This game butchered a lot of that game's charm but quickly cut off its face and wore it around as a facade. Sourcery feels flat and weak and almost entirely pointless at times due to it just being sucked out of you like nothing by most every enemy you come across (not to mention they're oftentimes weak and eat your AP like no tomorrow when you can do comparable damage or effects for the same amount AP). Some of the combat scenarios you will go through are also just tedious and can take upwards of an hour and a half per fight even when you are spending less than two minutes per character turn.Slight Edit The difficulties are also superficial in their differences. Tactician spouts on about in its description about how enemies have special effects and think more about their moves. In truth the enemies have double your base stats double vitality phys. and magic armor and quite often double your damage. They also commonly outnumber you meaning that you are up creek without a paddle. The first voidwoken you spot upon landing on the beach have ""vampire"" which lets them lifesteal damage they do. Some enemies have a bonus spell that 'spices' things up (usually a summon or something else of the sort that also has double your stats). It's not even a fair way to play the game because you often have to abuse game mechanics and essentially cheat with quicksaves and quickloads to get anywhere. I am by no means a noob at this game either. I played a coop save with a friend in the first original sin where we both picked lone wolf which rendered us locked to a two man party. We functioned as a team and got through the playthrough easy peasy as a first playthrough. That was a fair challenge. This game's difficulties are nothing more than jokes to play on people expecting a tactical difference in how the AI functions.The biggest kicker and the most apparent reason for my negative review is that the game is HORRIBLY optimized for Radeon cards. I have an AMD Radeon R9 Fury Sapphire and it absolutely begins to cook under the pressure of this game's coding. Within six minutes of starting the game mind you this is only at the main menu my graphics card's temperature jumps from 54 degrees Celsius to 72 degrees. Six minutes. On the menu. I have a water cooling system and near to seven fans in my PC that are all optimized to keep my tower as cool as possible. For comparison I can play Doom on Ultra graphics at 1920x1080 resolution for hours without my PC trying to become an easy bake oven. The problem persists even on the lowest graphics settings as if it just wants to fry my GPU (once again something that happens in no other game regardless of graphics settings). This game is absolutely a hog and even the devs know it because they always talk about needing to remove peripherals from your USB or shutting off all non essential programs. What is this a pre flight check up? Just program your game better and give AMD cards a fair chance with optimization.This problem is not just me either. Many other AMD users based on community posts support tickets and forum posts have had similar issues are just being flat out unable to play the game because it crashes their graphics drivers. If you are an AMD user avoid this game and buy its predecessor a game you will enjoy far more. This might seem like pointless ranting but as a consumer who has tested multiple things to adjust how this game functions. When I can't even play the game with my friends for more than a couple hours at a time (and at risk for damaging my PC) then this game has serious problems.",Divinity: Original Sin 2 - Definitive Edition
2017-12-09,4,23,84,False,Not Recommended,What starts as a fun first two Acts quickly devolves into a bug ridden mess with horrible AI and unfinished quests. NPC says you should team up to kill a common enemy? Be prepared for them to focus only you over the literal end of the world. Quest puzzle? Why bother it was never finished and you can just lockpick the reward. Why even raise someone in combat when the AI allies included sometimes will focus fire them to death before you get your turn to heal them. Save too often? Save bloat can break your save and it's unfixable. Want to pass a speech check? Whoops the game keeps selecting a character who you didn't level persuasion on so you can't. The freedom is amazing early on but it becomes quickly apparent that the last Act wasn't bug tested or balanced at all. If the final Act was actually fixed and low on bugs I'd recommend it but as it is there's just a frustrating unfun slog through Arx to capstone what started as a fun RPG. The last 20% of the game is a garbage fire that ruins a fun adventure.,Divinity: Original Sin 2 - Definitive Edition

2018-05-25,0,0,175,False,Not Recommended,I think Steam probably needs a neutral option for reviews this game being a prime reason why. The game was a solid experience through most of it but faltered a bit in the last chapter. Throughout the first 3 chapters I was so engrossed in the game that I tried to complete every single side quest. For the most part I found the combat fun inuitive and satisfying. However as I said the last chapter slows down a bit and the ending... well without spoiling anything... it leaves a lot to be desired. I can see what the devs were going for with the ending but it made me feel like most of the stuff I did was for nothing. On top of that there are a number of other problems that got on my nerves throughout my playthrough(s). On a number of occassions your characters are forced into unescapable dialogue and the character that enters said dialogue is just the one that happens to be closest to the NPC. As a result of this on several occassions I had to reload a save as options were locked off for me because the character that was forced into the dialogue did not have the prerequisite persuasion skill or tags. Another major issue is that I found the game was somewhat linear although it presents itself as open world. Many of the encounters will be impossible until you reach a certain level and as a result I found myself having to ascertain a particular order in which to play the encounters so that I wouldn't get trashed and in my opinion those defeats before I ascertained the order was not due to my skill level as at the point that I attempted them my characters could barely make a dent into the enemy's armour or health. I also dislike the dev's decision to make you stuck with a set of companions. I would have liked to switch out my companions at will instead of having to make my choice and go through the rest of the game with it. I didn't really have too many issues with bugs but there were a few here and there. On top of that the game has you go through questlines and jump through hoops only to find that no matter what you do everything you did was pointless. One particular instance was a side quest during the final chapter. After going through several difficult encounters because I didn't have a specific companion in my party I could not continue the questline and no matter what I did the quest automatically failed. For the most part the armour visuals in the game were not to my taste. I found many of them too exaggerated especially the higher end ones and felt that they felt out of place with the game's tone. A number of other reviews have suggested multiple playthroughs but I wouldn't suggest that. I played through it a second time andI felt that the story mode didn't have much more to offer after a single playthrough as the results and quests played out the same and the only difference would be something along the lines of a three sentence difference. And it appears to me that the major consequences all stem from the mass effect 3 esque decision you make at the game's end. I'm sure the game master mode would be a lot of fun if I could find 3 other people willing to buy a $55 game. Also you'll find yourself at a disadvantage if you create your own character as much of the content revolves around using one of the characters the game has picked for you. If you do you'll miss out on a number of quests and events in the game making the experience less enjoyable. Ultimately if you ignore the ending and you are willing to deal with a lot of the problems present in the game I would buy it on sale. But if you don't want to put in hours after hours just for a major disappointing at the end I would spend your money elsewhere.,Divinity: Original Sin 2 - Definitive Edition

2018-02-21,0,0,48,False,Not Recommended,"I loved D OS so I picked this game up expecting something similar in way of feel and experience. At the start the feeling I got was kind of like that but with characters that felt like they had more depth to them and a revamped combat system. My inital thought was ""I wonder how this will work out. Can't wait to see the full extent of it."" I felt like the first game needed an improvement on the combat system. I liked it but at the same time it felt like it needed some improvements something I hoped they had adressed in D OS2.What I met however was a combat system that the further into the game I got proved itself the most tedious gameplay I have ever experienced. The addition of armor wasn't much of a problem in the beginning. It just acted as a buffer to not go full CC at the start of combat. However the further I got the more armor the enemies got and the more boring the game became for me. Having to spend 5 10 min just grinding down enemies armor hoping you can do enough dmg to their health before they use a spell or potion to buff their armor back up feels like a bunch of kids screaming ""you can't hurt me because I got this special armor!"" As someone who really enjoyed playing a mage that could burn freeze charm or sleep enemies I couldn't get over the way the armor makes every enemy immune to all this.I tried to get over my feelings for quite some time and I liked the rest of the game (the story scenery music and just random banter and funny stuff you encounter) but the combat system ruined the experience for me. That's why I would not recommend this game if you enjoyed the combat system in the first game at all.",Divinity: Original Sin 2 - Definitive Edition

2019-01-22,2,3,83,False,Not Recommended,Product received for free. This game is one of the most overrated I have ever played and probably the most overrated RPG I have ever played.It has absolutely no respect for your time and nearly every aspect of the game is either monotonous like searching thousands of crates (if you don't you're undergeared) or every difficulty check fight requiring setup like shifting barrels or teleporting targets during dialogue. I was very disappointed with the linearity in effective character builds at high difficulty as a big fan of turn based strategy.The other aspects of the game are either obtuse and completely pointless (like the crafting system the fact the whole map loads at once or how some questlines are structured) or decent like the OST voice acting for named NPCs and the writing in the earlier parts of the game. If I had not received this game as a gift and played with a group of friends I never would have even bothered to make it past act 2.

2017-09-16,2,48,47,False,Not Recommended,1. UI Menus for crafting character sheets and so on are obstructive. Terrain such as bridges overhanging cliffs etc block nearly all vision of your party which makes it difficult to navigate through streets and valleys. Sometimes you can end up walking all the way up a hill and through a an environment hazard because you clicked on a random cliff edge above wherever your characters were.2. Combat and questsUnless you thoroughly go through each area and soak up as many quests as possible you will be underleveled and undergeared. This in combination with the ruthless AI makes combat an absolute chore that requires savescumming. Element interactions and environmental hazards are poorly explained and require experimentation to fully understand. So much can be going on during a fight that it is difficult to gauge what is happening at any given time. Aiming up and down cliffs also seems to have random restrictions placed on what you can and cannot hit (spells can't go over banisters but arrows act like ICBM's when shot up from the first floor). 3. CameraThe camera is at the perfect level of awkwardness where it requires you to zoom allll the way out to see where you're going but demands you zoom back in to pixel hunt for objects. It's easy to lose track of dead bodies in tall grass or behind bushes unless you outline them with fire spells first. Sometimes a combination of bad geometry and camera angles will make it impossible for you to see enemy NPC's at all. It is very frustrating to walk into a random ambush after failing to manually save the game.4. Map designMaps act like extended corridors for the sake of staging ambushes. Walk into an area &gt autosave function triggers &gt hostile NPC gives you 1 3 responses which almost always end up in a fight.5. Skills attributesThe effectiveness of any given build during a blind run comes down to dumb luck. Example I ran into some lava slugs in a cavern. Unless I had taken the trait that allowed me to diplomatically talk to slugs/dogs/cats I would have had to fight them with a butter knife and wool clothes. I had literally no idea that would be useful prior to that situation.

2017-09-14,0,0,155,False,Recommended,After reading alot of reviews myself and as someone who bought the game on release and played the beta 70 times over all i have to say is that this game is good but you can see why many would dislike it. So lets go over a few things about it and see.QUESTS As someone who has made about 9 different characters and playthroughs and as someone who beat it back before there was a single guide up for the game all i can say is some quests are a pain that is no lie but this game requires alot of back tracking and reading and memory but even then you can screw a whole hour of quest chain up with simple things such as accidently not saving a NPC or killing one or even killing one too early who may of been able to give hints or not picking up a right item in an area.This can kill it for some people but for me it was interesting to see how every quests could be completed by simple dialogue trees or even having a item before the quest or even stuffing it up all together and just brute forcing through it. Do i think some quests are Yes. Do they drag a little bit sometimes? Yes. but thats the nature of a long read and walk about RPG.COMBAT Now this is one that people love to on do i think it can be balls? holy hell yes this combat can be either the easiest combat in world or the hardest most unfair combat in any game it most of the time comes down to build and you characters and companions some builds are better then others but it all comes down to Turn Based Enemy First Every Fight t this means every fight most enemies are allowed to go first and will always use most biggest hit moves possible to knock off your armour and magic resist leaving you to your 1 go and mercy of every enemy as they gang up on single targets for better effectiveness. But sometimes it aint all bad when ya get hang of it and do a fight 700 times ya start to feel good when ya do a well place set of moves during your turns and completely wipe floor using barely any poitons or scrolls.ARMOUR/MAGIC RESIST Now this is a mechanic i can see people hate cause i hated it to and still do in some cases because sometimes end game tanks can look like this YOU (2000 Armour) Enemy (4000 Armour) and take this if you hit a enemy you do maybe 300 500 damage per go while some enemies can deal 800 1000 depending on difficulty and level and this just isnt fun you spend the whole game getting gold and items only for it to mean jack most fights .STORY As someone who played OS1 and genuinely enjoyed every moment of it the story in this feels lack luster and very all over the place it retcons alot but it does add some neat twists maybe too many but if you only played OS1 you may really enjoy this story taken as a spin off or alt universe but i never played the other games bar OS1/OS2 but my best friend told me everything about the entire lore of every other game so i do understand alot in the game but can see why some fans would hate it.But all in all this game is worth a playthrough if you played OS1 and truely enjoyed it and if you hate turned based rpgs then give it a miss and if you hate long reading and lots of drawn out quests.My Final Score 8.5/10 I loved it from start to finish and spent a good 50 70 hours in beta and played the hell out of this and still do from time to time when im in mood for a bit of Sin.,Divinity: Original Sin 2 - Definitive Edition

2017-09-26,0,0,230,False,Recommended,Need to stop making emotional reviews.Game is set with you imprisoned and alone you can make friends quite easily and get a team up an running quite quickly.You start with 2 pretty much sole missions. 1/ To work out what the hell a godwoken is and why they're being jailed. 2/ To solve the meaning of the universe.. etc.. the usual really.Now Questing is quite simple an idea.. someone says something to you.. you decide to follow up on it and must glean clues to resolve it in the most part the missions/quests are fairly straight forward but many are just poorly laid out others are pretty insanely difficult and very very drawn out. You'll need to talk to animals to people read books and letters persuade alot of people you're right and you'll even speak to the odd spirit or three.Combat is turn based.. for the first time in gaming history it is actually better to have a smaller team than a bigger one. As the ai always gets 5 6+ combatants and you can only have 4 max the ai then alternates with you 1 combatant at a time. ie if your team is 4 each character fights every 8 turns or so. If you have a smaller group you can plan more efficiently and capitalise on taking out the damage dealers in the opposing team before they even get a shot off. In short the combat system is crap.You have a fair sized inventary of spells and skills to use some out of combat. Class skills are the usual mmo rpg fair D&amp D style. Graphics are excellent music is ok.. not superb.. but more than good enough. Overall game design feels rushed and lacking. Later sections of the game come over as largely broken or poorly planned and rushed.But overall it is also a fun game repeatable and the ending is fairly good. (If you remember to spread your team out and not get aoe wiped in the first 5 seconds)You get to play Origin characters custom characters and these include undead.. to which all AI will attack on sight.

2016-11-20,0,0,137,True,Recommended,Ignore playtime I've cleared all available content. Took about 10 hours taking my time and reading mostly everything.Big patches are rare but the game itself is solid. It's an improvement in every way over the original. Currently only the first chapter is available. It's 'alpha' ish so it's buggy but it's coming along well. The original characters are pretty cool for singleplayer and the default 4 player is a very welcome addition. Origins are preset stories/personalities for followers (though you still control what they say they just have more options). They're race/gender specific. As is all the characters are very likeable but don't be afraid of going Custom! You don't miss out on anything big (so far) and don't feel like you're left out as you sometimes have more flexible dialogue choices.The Undead race is presently not in the game. Hopefully we'll have a sort of Zombie Forsaken esc race rather than just some skeletons.Lizard race is pretty cool. Name is a bit silly (lizard (race) vs lizard (animal)?) but they look cool and are pretty badass.Gear appearance is race specific which was going above and beyond for them but you'll want to make sure you like the way the gear looks before picking your race. IMO the elf stuff looks a bit much but eventually we'll have mods to fix that (probably).The story is more coherent and very present in all you're doing. That said there are multiple ways to handle the majority of quests. (HOWEVER do NOT sell the telekenisis gloves as you will need them in a maze later on.)The writing is more concise this time around but clearer and better. Source Magic is a nonrecharging resource which is pretty cool but so far the only ways to acquire it are obnoxious and higher level spells require you to spend source (which has a very small cap of 3 some spells taking 2) which feels clunky and tedious. That said this is only chapter 1 so we'll see how it goes.TL DR Only chapter 1 available improvement in every single way over Original Sin 1 which was already an 8/10+ game.

Probably the biggest reason though is I am oh so sick and tired of AAA games and their micro loot shit grubby greedy What this game gives you is a complete game and you don t have to pay to unlock weapons and gear. And if the first DOS is anything to go by they will most likely release an enhanced version for free if you already own DOS2 ""fingers crossed"" cause this game does have some issues My biggest complaints are 1. Inventory management is a complete mess it s terrible one of the worst I have ever seen.2. How often you need to replace your gear is terrible and feels like a chore. It doesn t feel special when you kill a boss and get that sweet epic cause when you roll back into town a vendor will most certainly sell a better one.3. The last act in Arx was not as fun as the first couple I really felt like I just wanted to finish the game and probably paid the least amount of attention in that act.4. I had casters and melee and I made it through the game just fine but I really did feel like it would have went smoother if I had all melee or casters because of the armour system.

2019-01-06,6,211,74,False,Not Recommended,I've played football management games since the days when they came on cassette tapes. I've played this franchise since Championship Manager 97 98 and I've played every version intensively. Football Manager 2019 is the worst version of the game ever. There are many reasons for this. Firstly the match engine is terrible and has been the subject of countless bug reports and complaints on Sports Interactive's Football Manager forums. One particular annoyance has been the problem of getting players to cross the ball they will seemingly do anything but. But it would be wrong to focus on my 'favourite' bug in the game as there are so many problems with the match engine and other areas of the game which explains why at the time of writing this review there are more than 20 000 posts on the bugs forum. One of the big claims to improvement by SI for this game was the revamped training system. However it is shambolic. The sheer volume of choices which should be a good thing becomes an issue when the decisions you make either have no effect or trigger immediate problems. The AI controlling player personalities driving interactions with players is simply broken. One of my favourite examples is a player who was a few months into a five year contract. I was given a heads up that he was unhappy because he wanted a new contract. He hadn't asked for a new contract much less been refused but was unhappy anyway. I opened a private chat with him but the chat was over immediately because his reaction was that he was so pleased I'd come to talk to him he didn't want a new contract any more. There are many threads on the forums devoted to the nonsensical and plain silly player interactions which really mar the game.Press conferences are the most tedious pointless aspect of the game. There is an option for allowing the AM to handle them but it doesn't matter how good your AM is he will make a mess of press conferences. The much vaunted dynamics on the game are equally ridiculous with players showing unhappiness on one screen appearing to be entirely happy on another. As a tactics buff I expected great things when I first saw the new tactics screens on FM19. However for all the choices you have you might as well not bother because the don't seem to affect matches in the slightest. It's not just the crossing problem. Pressing possession play marking... it's simply broken. On a tactic I used I had instruction for two of my players to man mark specific positions on the opposition teams. I played many many matches and never saw my players make a single attempt to mark those positions in fact the opposite seemed to be true with the opposition players being given huge amounts of time and space. The daftness of the game permeates every single element. After I played a Community Shield match I got an inbox message stating that my keeper had set a new Community Shield record by keeping one clean sheet as the previous record had been zero clean sheets. I paid good money for this game. I am not alone in being infuriated by paying for a game which is simply not ready. Unfortunately there are limited opportunities to make complaints. The obvious option in to use the Sports Interactive forums. However the level of dissatisfaction over the game being raised on the forums seems to have triggered a policy of moderators silencing complaints and banning forum users who show any dissent against the full on barrage of positive propaganda being spouted by moderators and developers. It suggests SI know they got this game badly wrong. Personally I'm so infuriated with the way SI have milked the fans with this poor iteration of the game which has compounded the problems that surfaced with FM18 after the brilliant FM17 that I will not buy any further iterations. One bad game is a blip but two consecutive bug ridden games compounded by SI's apparent policy of silencing unhappy paying customers has made me completely lose faith in the company.,Football Manager 2019

2018-10-19,2,34,162,False,Not Recommended,"I very rarely leave reviews. That is because I don't regard myself competent in most of the video game genres. But it is different for football manament games. I have been playing in this genre since 1997. My addiction and love started with Premier Manager 97. Then follows the CM98/99 CM99/00. FM 2005 is still fresh in my memories. Hours of gameplay... Lots of soul breaking matches played...And now it is FM 19. I pre ordered it. Big expectations. Bang. Incorrect squad registration roles for Turkish League. Totally unplayable in Turkey. I said ok. Football is universal. Go play somewhere else until they fix it. Took my favourite team in BPL which is Liverpool. Bang! Salah is injured for 11 months during a pre season match. Re started the game. Bang! Mane is gone for 9 months. Re started the game. Bang! Salah is gone 7 months. I said ok I will keep playing this time. 27 players in the squad. Total injuries were 145 throughout the season. Salah couldn't play a single match. Sturridge played 25 matches and scored 4 goals. The most shocking thing was I became the champion with 11 matches lost and 7 draws. I said ok. This is a pre release game. They will fix it. They always did.But no. Not this time they did. Last time I checked I am in 90 hours in this game. The further I came with a team without deleting the save is fifth match in the second season. Here is why 1. Poor match engine optimisation Your striker is very unlikely to score in one on one situations. And by unlikely I mean %5 10. Your probabilty to score goals from rigth wing/left wing crosses are much higher than to score a goal from the penalty kick. During a highlight you are very likely to see that one of your players is running completely opposite way from where everything is happening. Sometimes it is same for the other team's players. You can easily bet your home on that if your defenders started to pass the ball back and forth you will concede a goal.2. Poor VAR optimisation Around %90 of the key moments in a match contains a VAR situation The refs very unlikely to give a penalty decision without consulting the VAR.3. Player's penaltyI call this ""player's penaly"". Let me explaing what I mean. You take Chelsea. Trying to land a big name. You offer a big sum of cash. Rejected. The same transfer season your rival lands the same player for less. In another save you are Man City. You are after the same player. Offered a big sum. Gets rejected. Chelsea signs that player for less. Same scenario is also valid while negotaiting with a player. You offer 4m euro per year to a player. Gets rejected. Same player signs a contract with an AI managed club for 2m euros.One question here is very necessary. WTF?4. Translations (You don't have to read this part if your mother tongue is not Turkish) Since the first Turkish translation is introduced I have been forcing myself to play it in Turkish. But after a few continues I go back to English. The very first time it was introduced the translation was disgustingly bad. I don't remember the year I think it was 2014. Clearly a google translation. In comparison now it is a lot better this year. But still there is a major problem with the translation that must be addressed. And that is I don't feel myself that I am reading the news from a Turkish newspaper or conducting a interview with the Turkish media or listening the commentary from a Turkish commentator.It feels like a word to word translation of an English sportsman commentating or asking questions. What I mean by that is there is no translation of the jargon. It is like you read a translation of your new rented property's contract. Just word by word. Even the English idioms or figurative phrases are translated to Turkish word by word which doesn't make any sense when you read them in Turkish. ""They leave with a win in their bags"" What bags? They brought their own bags before the game? Interesting huh?I mean no offense to English culture and literature here. But this doesn't give me the same vibe when I play in Turkish.5. Unjustified buzz before the release On youtube I watched so many videos about the new purple background and a new picture in the introduction page and also a new layout in the menu.The purple background it is just a skinThe new picture(s) in the intro just a pictureThe new layout took me 3 seconds to adjustI am a veteran FM player and don't give a fuchsia about any of these.With all being said I will probably keep playing the game as it is the only AAA game in this genre. But I can't recommend this game anymore. I don't even recognize it as a game. It became a database for real proffesional football clubs with some 3d match engine in it.",Football Manager 2019

2018-11-01,3,97,813,False,Recommended,This has to be the most polished release of Football Manager that I can remember in a long time. It feels stable it runs smoothly the new features seem to work (and as intended). Most importantly the Match Engine feels like it has had attention put into the right places. At first glance it might not look like too much has changed if you've been playing Football Manager for as long as I have you'll appreciate the changes to the training module and match engine. Training has made a move to units and modules attempting to replicate what happens in professional football more accurately. Players will train in defensive and attacking units working on phases and patterns of play linked heavily to the way you want your team to play. Where previously you'd say 'Defending' now you can say what KIND of defending high engaging press? A low block dealing with crosses? It may seem like a small change but for me this is what I've been after for nearly 4 years. A way to link all the different aspects of management and coaching together. The match engine has had attention placed on helping us as gamers understand what the different match engine options sliders and instructions do and mean. You're even provided with tactical templates to build so you can see how the instructions all link together. Want to play tiki taka? There's a template for that that will set the team up to play that style. This is where FM19 excels for me this year its teaching us how the game works its helping us better understand the thought process and dedication PaulC and team have put into the match engine. There are even new user inductions for the new features too nothing has been left to chance. Perhaps its because of this that the game has felt slightly 'easier' this year I don't seem to be battling against how I feel an idea should work and how the match engine design makes it work. I can see changes I make within the ME taking effect. It has made it easier to exploit the weaknessess of the opposition which now begs the question when will the opposition manager AI do the same thing. Hopefully FM20 can continue the progress started in FM19.More reviews on my curator page https //store.steampowered.com/curator/27022862 LuchaLabs/,Football Manager 2019
2019-01-08,38,80,76,False,Not Recommended,Yes it's another Football Manger game I buy every year. But the same problem for me is still in the game. Even worse this year somehow. Here is the latest example of the problem that most recent FM games have.FA Cup FinalArsenal vs Manchester City I've stood firm and kept my inform youngster upfront for the game95th Min 1 0 Arsenal! my youngster scores! Surely winning the FA Cup!Kick off Arsenal get possestion back and pass around the back. Defender passes the ball from outside the box slowly to the GK. The GK walks towards it then runs away from the ball 1 1.Totally unacceptable I say this every year. I DO NOT CARE ABOUT THE GRAPHICS ENGINE. I still use the 2D dots (but had to look at the 3D to see WTF happened and it looks even worse on there. The GK just stands there then turns and runs away.)This is the latest example of this happening out of the 3 or 4 times its happened previously during the season. Also every other email is an injury to a player I know im managing Arsenal but come on this is crazyEDIT its happend 2 more times since this review same action. But for the other team.,Football Manager 2019
2019-01-28,6,65,398,False,Not Recommended,I honestly don't understand how this game can be so expensive especially considering next to nothing has been changed from previous versions. Whilst at times it might be fun the scripting is unreal and spoils any realism. It isn't user friendly. It's overly restrictive in some area's whilst overly detailed in others. To top it off it has a truly cancerous community and dev team that don't seem to want to make any fixes or changes to the game.The match engine is completely broken. If you are going to have 3D view and animation at least make enough varients that it isn't repetetive. Make idiotic things like 40 yard own goals almost impossible to happen (has happened twice in two different cup finals for me the odds of that ever happening irl are minute). Tactics make no difference. None. Results seem pre determined before the game has started. Players seem to do the opposite of what you ask. Some games reloading and changing things yields different results but in most it takes at least 20 games if not more before you ever get any sort of result. It took me fourty games yes FOURTY to score a single goal in one tie despite me having comfortably beaten the very same team 2 0 just a week before. One on Ones are broken. 90% of the time they will miss or hit it straight at the keeper. The amount of shots especially long range ones that are clearly saved by the keepers and magically every time clip the crossbar are given as goalkicks instead of corners. Kick off goals are insanely common. Strikers are broken as is crossing the ball. Your wingers will get 20 goals a season whilst your striker struggles to get 10. Corners and freekicks are the main way to score and even the worst players deliver a world class free kick 80% of the time. You can never win an appeal for a red card injuries are far too common.Too much is wrong. Not worth buying if you have an older version of the game.,Football Manager 2019
2018-11-01,6,62,322,False,Recommended,Feels better than the bare minimum data update rubbish of recent years. It feels much better and the response to the things you do seems to make more sense and feel less like a robotic time wasting exercise in doing stuff just because you know it's better if you do despite the mind numbing tedium. In summary bearing in mind the crap we've been putting up with this last decade or so with this lot this is definitely a step in the right direction. I think they knew the writing was on the wall and have tried to improve things and listen to their customers rather then take them for granted so applause for that but there's still work to be done.Remember every bug in the game play? Crosses One v ones always missing needing to create 30 chances to score 2 goals while the cpu beats you 3 2 with two shots total? Yeah well all of that nonsense is still there as it always has been. The engine still needs a tear down and rebuild but they clearly don't have the balls or the will to do so. Niftier graphical representations of action are not going to solve this. It's time to evolve lads and consign this engine to history imo. You've polished this turd to a shiny gleam it will not polish much further methinks.Apparentlhy the injuries were sorted for release. I'm a (game time) month in and i've had ten TEN! 2.5 a week! We haven't played a competitive game yet my training intensity is low and i've been giving the players 45 60 minute run outs. It's bloody bonkers! If this is the injury issue fixed then you need to look again. All in all at first glance it feels like we're getting there but i feel like it's just better stuff bolted onto the same old problems tbh and when i've had a decent amount of time to assess what's what i'll probably end up hating myself for being such an idiot again and giving my cash to people who probably don't deserve it all things considered. Right now though i like most of what i see.What these lot need is some decent competition to give them a proper kick up the but i don't see that happening any time soon tbh. If like me you've been bitterly dissapointed with pretty much every release in the last decade or so then probably you'll see past the gloss however that said this feels like a much better effort and whilst it won't make up for feeling fleeced by these people over the last decade or more it's certainly now approaching the game it needs to be. They need to be braver and tackle the match engine though they really do.,Football Manager 2019
2018-10-27,7,33,543,False,Recommended,As an avid championship manager and football manager officianado over the last 2 decades i will admit i had been semi bored of the similarities or lack of new features in each iteration of the game.This year changes that somewhat. The tactical overhaul makes it easier for both new players to get involved and keeps the same level of depth for the more tactically minded of managers.The training has been expanded allowing you to take charge of the weekly schedules PROPERLY. Team cohesion a little low? Best go out for a team building excercise in the community. Star striker looking a little biy chubby? Fatness to Fitness my friend.A lot of the old FM 'Memes' still exist. You can still put 40 shots on the opponent and not score whilst they have 1 on shot and win 1 0. Goalkeepers and outfield players still make minor mistakes. But the player interaction has improved massively. A lot of the time just approaching the player to talk to them about their issues can resolve the issue.All in all this game is still currently in beta. Theres still a few bugs to fix and im sure over the course of the year more will be found. I think the new era bodes well though.Long Live FM and i'm going to give this bad boy a 9/10 rating. whilst also plugging my channel for FM videos *cough* Keg Man Plays *cough cough*,Football Manager 2019
2018-11-20,9,71,343,False,Not Recommended,Two seasons in and can't really play anymore. In beta match engine was fine now it's complete and utter garbage player's instructions don't work top strikers are missing sitters again and again their 1 shot is goal mine 5 1v1 are 0 goals. You can argue some things but the beta engine was better they are selling full price game for beta test again. And please if there's closed beta test and open beta test SI really have any testers in their company? I doubt it.In beta crosses were slightly OP? Ok we'll make a winger/fullback to wait 3 opposition players to close then smash cross and get corner. Too many corners okay will make them even less. So now every tactics work's like AI is parking the bus very narrow and with no crosses working you couldn't do anything.,Football Manager 2019

2014-12-26,1,4,7117,False,Recommended,"Garry's Mod is a timeless game even when you do not play it anymore.Garry's Mod (or GMod as it is known) is branded as a sandbox game that allows you to do whatever the heck you want. You can build a spaceship out of bathtubs or you can rob someone's money printing operation.It is this unique sandbox feel that Garry's Mod was able to create very well by opening it up to the community at an early stage before a lot of games even tried. Garry's Mod allowed creators to do what they do best and create for the game. Sure Garry himself came up with ""sandbox"" mode but it is the community that made Garry's Mod what it is with the popular gamemodes such as Trouble in Terrorist Town or my favourite DarkRP.DarkRP was my favourite from the start when my friend recommended it to me whilst I was Skyping him. At this time he was playing on a server called TPS Gaming which I had never heard of. This was back in 2012 when it was only a year or so old and was on the Evocity map. We went and 'based' in the hotel and money printed not being the best law obiding citizens.The point is that DarkRP allowed me to develop my friendship with the only friend I really had on steam at that point and he is still my friend today. He eventually got a little tired of it but I continued to play and I continued to play for 5 more years spending 3000 hours on the DarkRP server alone. My journey in this server led to me making many friends even a few who are still my friends today. These friends led me to another friend group giving me even more friends. I felt like a part of a community a big community. TPS Gaming was a community and although it's not around today I still want to thank it for giving me the friends I have today and giving me countless hours of enjoyment.Thank you to Tommy for introducing me to the game and still being my friend. Thank you to Robbie for being a noob and basing with me (bad decision) and continuing to be my friend to this day.Although I hardly ever click the 'Launch' button on Garry's Mod anymore it still holds a place in my heart. &lt 3",Garry's Mod

That's horse Really Garry's Mod is a horrible terrifying twist filled mind . To this day I still can't stop thinking about Setsumi and her internal struggle to leave the 7th floor or Kaede and her attempt to fit in with the other children. What really got to me though is how Shinji wouldn't get into the ing Eva. That really bothered me. Anyway Garry's Mod is all these things and none of these things at once. Basically what I'm trying to say is that I type kind of fast and I like the way it sounds so I just keep writing bull so I can hear the wonderful clicking sound of my Razer keyboard thing that I payed way too much for with fake Charry Mx switches. However the wonderful people of Garry's Mod don't seem to mind too much about my mic spam and stuff so it's all fine. This is probably the only fun I'll have all day so please let me continue.I feel like it's my obligation to write an almost 5 paragraph essay because that's what my English class is for right? Actually English is so annoying. ""Yes I love reading books written 2 000 years ago that don't make any sense in this language."" ""Oh 'Beowulf'? It's Skyrim. That's it."" I actually try in school so I got put into honors English so I guess that's what's eating all my time.Garry's Mod has wasted so much of my time. Time that I could've spent studying or reading or other stuff I pretend to do. That's why I recommend Garry's Mod. It's one of the worst games I've every played but so stupid that you continue playing. Most people who play are little kids who don't know what they're doing but I think that's how it is with most games. Then you get others whose job it is to annoy the out of other people. Garry's Mod servers are like hell but better than hell because they're kind of real. In hell though you don't get people changing the vocaloid music you try to play on PlayX into pony so idk hell might be better. However there is one thing that I must compliment Garry on and that is the storyline.If it weren't for Garry's Mod my writing would be more clear and easy to follow but I've lost most of my brain matter because of Garry.

Tired of fixed mandatory objectives in every single game you play? This game is a perfect reprieve! Had too much enough of said reprieve? Download and play a different objective based gamemode or map! If you do not own this game right your wrong and buy it! But a fair warning this game can be incredibly glitchy at times so be prepared for that when you start playing and keep it in mind for future gameplay. All in all though the glitchiness does not at all overshadow the fact that this is an absolute MUST HAVE that you will NOT be disappointed by! However I suggest that if you are going to puuchase this game that you maybe purchase some other Source Engine titles to go with it. 8/10,Garry's Mod

When you buy Garry's Mod you are really paying $10 for a blank canvas. It's up to you to find out what you want to do with it. You can mess around in the sandbox making cities waging wars doing heists with friends really there is no limit. If you don't like to use the sandbox mode no worries. This canvas you bought can do so many other things. How about you play a game where you and many others work together to try to kill a small group of Traitors who are also trying to kill you? How about a game where you disguise as props and play a big game of hide and seek? Theres way more than just that but I hope you get my point. Valve has given us this canvas where you can do whatever you want. The Steam workshop is your portal to all of the things you can get to shape your canvas and make your game how you want it to be.

2016-12-05,12,69,3112,False,Not Recommended,"Introduction Garry's Mod. A fun sandbox style do what you want kind of game. At least that's what it's advertised as and what people say about it. Garry's Mod is however very unique. The base game is one gamemode and 2 maps with HL2 content such as weapons and props. That's about it. What provides the magnitude of content is the community itself. Since it's release there has been a plethora of content added and created for this quite simple mod. So why would I someone with over 2000 hours of this game not recommend this game? There's a ton of reasons for this and I could legitimately write a book about it but I'm going to boil it down to a set of main ideas. Gamemodes Gamemodes are strictly speaking the heart of Garry's Mod. There are a range of gamemodes available each with their own interesting rules and gameplay. Or at least there would be if it wasn't for the fact that literally only about 5 of these gamemodes are played and have oversaturated the server browser. These are Trouble in Terrorist Town Murder DarkRP (Or any very mildly modified varient they all count) Prop Hunt and Deathrun. I'm leaving Sandbox out of it because it's Sandbox. Let's boil these down to what they should be and what they actually are 1. Trouble in Terrorist TownTrouble in Terrorist Town or TTT for short is a gamemode where you're meant to find out which of your comrades are Traitors and eliminate them or kill everyone else if you're the Traitors yourself. On the face of it it's quite intriguing. You do this by investigating bodies and determine which of your fellow terrorists are not what they seem based on location at time of death weapon and if they were seen committing the deed. However what it really is is an oversaturation of addons that do not work together dropping framerates and killing any sense of mystery (Because they wear ing cosmetics!) overly abusive admins who usually are 12 and paid for it using Mum's credit card trigger happy who thought sniffing the air around them was construed as an attempt on their life and then yell ""RDM"" at the top of their lungs to every available admin who will then ban at request without investigating claims. It takes about 50 hours of pulling your hair out searching through all servers to find an actual decent one.2. MurderOh boy did you expect a paragraph? Well you're out of luck this gamemode has literally been made for YouTubers and it is a dumbed down version of TTT except there are NO good servers. At all. Next.3. DarkRPDarkRP. A place where dreams go to die and people pretend to be someone else. Which is odd because on the face of it it looks like people could be extremely creative and have fun. ON THE FACE OF IT. The idea is you can get various ""Jobs"" in city life or make your own if you're just a basic citizen. The only real rules that are universal is the fact that you don't kill people without reason and if you die you don't get to remember your previous life. But in reality very few jobs are actually played usually as a result of server rules preventing you from doing anything actually fun. As well as this server owners again oversaturate the server with about 50000 different addons and have a 60 slot server which then results in 200 ping and laggy as gameplay even if the server is shoved right up your 4. Prop HuntProp Hunt is as it is. You hide as a variety of props and hide from the Hunters and the Hunters look for props. I actually don't have an issue with this mode except for the universal oversaturated addons list and laggy servers as a result. Some server are vanilla Prop Hunt and not much can then go wrong. 5. DeathrunDeathrun is Deathrun. Runners try to avoid traps set off by Death and you are eliminated on death. Runners try to survive and then kill Death and Death kills all runners with traps. Sounds simple. HOWEVER because of the nature of this mode which is no element of mystery server owners fill it with pointshop loot that you sometimes have to pay REAL MONEY for to get as well as 187562 different large as mods and voice lines which clog the server up and renders the game unplayable due to lag. And as a side effect the players get 200 ping at about 12 players on the server even if you again for some reason decide to put the server box right up your ing Addons Addons are what adds to the experience of Sandbox by adding numerous vehicles weapons weapon mods NPC's models props and effects. Now this sounds fine if it weren't for the way the main distribution platform worked. Oh boy strap yourselves in it's going to be a bumpy ride!1. The Steam Workshop Garrysmod.org Toybox and youNow you may be thinking ""What are those two latter distribution platforms?"". Well as of nowadays they're a graveyard. But before Gmod 13 these were the main sources of addons. This had its disadvantages and advantages because it meant going directly into your Gmod folders and manually placing addons and actually going onto these websites directly in the case of Garrysmod.org or downloading an addon which you had to access in a menu on Gmod but this then meant it wasn't always there clogging your addons list in the case of Toybox. This difficulty to install and upload was a godsend because this meant you usually only found high quality good content that people had made. The Steam Workshop however is an easy distribution platform which allows content creators to develop and share their work with the players of Garry's Mod. Well that does work to an extent like that. BUT! Because saves and dupes can also be uploaded as well as the ignorable bad addons you get a wide selection of 7 year olds making bad poses machines prop constructions and overly used memes you're best not looking for them. And they usually aren't popular. But they are if they involve one thing.2. The Cancer of Five Nights at Freddy's""OH GOODY I'M GOING TO MADE FOXY FREDDY IN HIS GAPING "" Every ing FNaF fan ever.These guys. These walking tumours are usually too afraid to play the actual games themselves but buy them to support their shrine for Scott Cawthon download all the FNaF addons that Gmod has to offer which are uploaded by 7 year olds with talent and make really terribly posed ragdolls usually beg for 5 stars and then because of the amount of kids on Gmod because of an issue I haven't brought up they make it to the front page of the Steam Workshop! Like how even is that possible? And to add insult to injury they also do it on the FNaF maps but the ones with no events because they're so ing scared of the actual game. And then they ACTUALLY GET 5 STARS. A FIVE NIGHTS AT FREDDY'S SAVE MAKES IT TO THE FRONT PAGE AND PUSHES DESERVING ADDONS DOWN INTO THE CESSPIT OF HELL. The Community Now as I'm sure you know the game is filled to the brim with 10 year olds. This wasn't so prevalent back in the day before the Resonance Cascade the introduction of a certain set of people.The YouTube Influx of 2013This basically ruined Gmod of today. The popular YouTubers brought in a wave of ing fanboys who flocked to the servers running the gamemodes they were playing. People who actually played the more alternate gamemodes lost people and then the servers running them died transforming Garry's Mod into a lifeless husk of its former self filled with kids and cancer. Conclusion Gmod is a game I simply cannot recommend based on these reasons if you're wanting to play it for the extreme variety of gamemodes. If you want it to play with your friends and ONLY your friends it's a very fun game (This is literally the only reason I still play it.) But for any other reason steer clear. This game is not what it once was.",Garry's Mod

Gmod offers a lot for the price its selling for. From Trouble in Terrorist Town to Star Wars Roleplay (RP). There are so many game mods alot are RP. It's not all RP though. You can create your own maps. If it's a rip off bomberman except with watermelons. DeathRun which is basically get to end of the map by going through obstacles. Or some normal and old school hide and seek. I would recommend it to who ever is looking for a descent game with a bunch of play value. You can play this game daily and not get sick of it. Because of the community involved with it. The community involves so many people with unique mind sets that for some reason will make the gameplay much more enjoyable. Even if they're RP as a homeless person in RP trying to sell you trash for a serious amount of money. P.S you will need at least a descent PC or Laptop to play this game.,Garry's Mod

I walked away and continued with my shopping and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in his hands without paying. The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional and was like Sir you need to pay for those first. At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter. When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually to prevent any electrical infetterence and then turned around and winked at me. I don t even think that s a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly.,Garry's Mod

2014-07-06,0,0,92,False,Recommended,Gmod a very old game but a very good one. Imagine building a car from scratch with all of your friends by your side. Or making your own zombie survival camp then spawning in zombies and KILLING THEM. You could also download little things that make your game much better. And if your like me and always want to get revenge then you can run over your friends with cars kill them with props shoot them or just close down the sever but then you wouldn't be able to play. You can also play by yourself. so all in all 100/100 ( You will never forget this game ),Garry's Mod

But the developers need to make the game a little bit more explanitory when you first boot up the game in sandbox like adding a tutorial that explains how to rotate objects use admin controls make the wire mod an official component of the game and giving a tutorial on that as well so more people can build more efficiently. Overall a good game that needs some improvement.,Garry's Mod

2018-01-15,0,0,587,False,Recommended,"As someone who has wasted a week of their life playing this game I can assure you that this game is worth every second. Let me try and run you through what will happen when you purchase this game. First you will spawn in a brand new world and have a wander around. Then you might spawn a few npc's ( non playable characters / bots ) and kill them. This will keep you entertained for a good few minutes ( many hours ). After that you will have a proper rummage through all the tools weapons vehicles ragdolls and other useless crap within your menu. Eventually you will tire of this and download some addons from the workshop just to liven things up a bit. Again you will have a good look at all the garbage you have downloaded. At this point you will be thinking about making your own addons to contribute to the amazing worshop. You have many ideas and plans but in the end you end up posing a female ragdoll bent over while they are being thrusted in the by a male ragdoll. You will be proud of your creation and so upload it to the workshop naming it ""GMOD SEX LOL XD 18+"". After a few more hours of loitering around in singleplayer you will discover ""Multiplayer"". You join many servers only to discover that they are full of little Russian kids screaming at you becuase you knocked over one of their props. Not all hope is lost becuase you will then find AMAZING servers full of awesome people and this is where you will waste many hours of your life ( Well it's where I did ). Eventually you will get bored and abandon this game for many months. One day you will be scrolling through your library of games and stuble upon Gmod. You'll remember all the good times you had and start playing again. In short this game is brilliant! Just play it! You will need Half Life 2 for the textures and possibly Counter Strike Source.

2018-05-30,6,791,16,False,Recommended,I won't tell you if you'll like it or not. I'll tell you what you're getting so you can decide for yourself.Here's the major points you're most likely interested in Roughly 15 to 30 hours of content (depending on your preferred pace). No replay value outside of achievements. Not particularly challenging even on its hardest difficulty. Very well polished in its presentation and execution (sans a few initial release bugs). Minimal lore primarily discovered scattered throughout the dungeons. Introduces a few interesting inventory mechanics to the scene while cleverly borrowing/marrying the rest of its designs from other successful inspirations.And here are the comparisons you likely care most about 1. Binding of Isaac's dungeons NOT playstyle.While exploring dungeons your top down perspective room to room exploration and overall map are all borrowed from Binding of Isaac / Legend of Zelda but you do not encounter any playstyle changing items throughout each run. Your only 4 attacks (a 1 to 3 hit combo and a charged attack for most weapons) are based on whatever 2 weapon types you brought with you (Sword and Shield Big Sword Spear Glove or Bow).2. Recettear's shop management NOT depth.You place items for sale at your desired price learn from your customers' reactions how to better price them next time and upgrade your shop. Each customer is not unique in their desired target price there is no back and forth bargaining per customer there is no buying items from customers there is no recommending items to customers there is no debt with a looming due date there is only roughly 200 items total (including weapons armors potions and materials) etc.3. Stardew Valley's city NOT gameplay.You can roam around a charming city talk to townsfolk add 5 buildings/NPCs to it (e.g. Blacksmith Alchemist etc) walk to the dungeons and... that's about it. There's no farming (obviously) no shop investments (beyond paying to spawn them) no seasons or real time clock system and no relationship building of any kind.4. Rogue Legacy's progression WITHOUT the passive skill tree.Between each dungeon run (after selling your loot from the previous run) you're given the opportunity to upgrade your gear. This gear (and its upgrades and enchantments) will increase your damage health defense or move speed which in turn makes you stronger (and your next run easier) until you can progress further (and eventually beat the game). However said upgrade options are very limited rather unimaginative and likely won't impact how you approach your next run. If this review was helpful please say so via the button below. Thanks!,Moonlighter
2018-05-29,64,197,18,False,Recommended,Great game BUT...I can't see slimes because I am red green colorblind. Please add a colorblind mode.,Moonlighter
2018-10-12,4,114,18,False,Recommended,"I regret being on the fence about buying this game. I've been loving it ever since i picked it up. It has that Stardew valley feel to it but unfortunately without most of the things that makes that game adorable. On the flip side it's reminiscient of Legend of Zelda games and is entirely focused on clearing dungeon floors sort of like the Binding of Isaac.I'll try doing a pros / neutral / cons thing for this review for once.PROS + Very charming and smooth pixel graphics á la Starbound Valley+ Gameplay is something like Recettear meets Legend of Zelda with storytelling like Rogue Legacy+ Relatively fast paced and reaction / pattern intensive. Mildly hardcore but not unfair!+ Clearly inspired by older Legend of Zelda games such as those found on GBA+ Magical soundtrack parts of it dynamic (changes while playing based on what you are doing or where you are). It's the kind of music you never really get tired of listening to. Very catchy and mix up intensive.+ No enemy recycling every biome has its own unique enemies and some only show up on lower floors or at night+ Clever randomized map design with secrets to find encourages exploring+ NPC writing is good if rather lacking in quantity... (Will elaborate)+ There is no hard time limit. Like Starbound Valley but without seasons or a day clock.+ Interesting fair bosses with no ""learn by death"" patterns. If you pay attention you can overcome everything.+ The default difficulty is ""Hard"". That's not something i've ever seen before but it can be adjusted if you want to.+ Every armor piece shows on your character and they can freely be mixed and matched at your leisure. + You decide prices of items you sell. This can be stressful and confusing if you do not like thinking.+ Dark background world / story that belies the cute graphics. You have to piece this together yourself.+ Very interesting dungeons with unique aesthetics and suitable music.Now for the neutrals. I will put these in because they could be a matter of opinion or playstyle some people won't mind this at all while for others it can be very disappointing.NEUTRAL The game is a rather short one. Few weapon upgrades (although progression locked due to material requirements) Besides grinding for money there's very little else to do than conquer the dungeon. Once you unlock everything... ..You no longer have anything to do in town except resupply. Small inventory forcing you to manage it wisely and return to town often or throw items away. Clever curse system on items that requires different and still clever inventory management. I doubt there's anything to do after conquering the few dungeons. They are fun but... Mobile game length. NPCs do not remember conversations. They will repeat themselves endlessly. Random town NPCs share lines. If you talk to multiple in a row they will finish each other's monologues. Some NPCs have portraits when they talk yet no more significance than any other NPC. Scrapped story assets? There is no player NPC interaction. They will only ever monologue to you. No decisions or similar. Good shop management is not actually important as you can endlessly grind for items in the dungeons. As you have a monopoly on the market there is no flooding the economy. Endless money! No real attack variation. Usually not a problem but lacks the flair of better hack&amp slash games when it comes to combat. You cannot hire guards to your store or expel repeat offenders. Thieves will constantly leave and come back immediately. You also have to wait for said thieves to commit a crime before you can stop them even if you know them well already. Movement in six directions for the most part. Walking diagonally feels unresponsive but it's there. You only attack in four directions. This is alright as so do your enemies. Easily exploitable with our flexibility. Your character is (barely) established no backstory but everybody in town knows you.CONS Each weapon class has ONE special attack regardless of what weapon type or tier you have. This attack SUCKS. The town feels very bare bones. As if there was more planned for it but then it was all scrapped once they had the shell. The other NPCs than your guide / tutor never gets fleshed out. They seem designed to have a larger part in the story. While the other NPCs have good writing in itself (elaborating on their stories and their society as a whole) they do not Play any significant part in the game and you can easily ignore them without missing out on anything. The only real reason to even manage the shop is to afford adventuring upgrades. Cynical and repetitive. Eventually guessing prices for new items can get overwhelming as there are a lot of items and no price references.I have probably missed out on a couple things but overall i still recommend this game. It's a great experience (especially when just starting out) and it's an enjoyable dungeon crawler / loot collecting game with generally satisfying gameplay.Please ask questions in the comments field if there is anything specific you would like to know or for me to add to the review.",Moonlighter
2018-08-13,2,81,18,False,Recommended,Moonlighter is a dungeon crawler with management elements. The story takes place in a small town built around dungeons that randomly appeared one day. As Will you play a shopkeeper who gets his inventory out of those dungeons. He is told to only stay at the first level and return safely once he found enough loot but Will dreams of becoming a full fledged hero.You can explore the dungeons during the day or the night but your shop will only find customers during the day. As you start of your adventure you're still very weak. As you fight you get loot meant for your shop but it can also be used to create stronger weapons and armor as well as health and other potions. If you lose all your health in a dungeon you lose most of your loot and have the choice to try again or return to the town. If you have a short run i.e. left on an early level you might even have time for another run after storing your current loot in your chest or on display in your shop.The dungeons themselves are pretty straightforward. They all have three levels that lead to one boss room. Some room have secret rooms underneath them which are indicated by a little sparkle. The dungeons are somewhat randomized but they all follow the same pattern. For example if you come across a healing room you are on the right path. If you manage to beat a boss the next dungeon will unlock. You can always return to the previous dungeon if you need those items. Beat all four dungeons and you open the mysterious fifth door that holds the secret to the town.The enemies inside the dungeons all have specific attack patterns. It's easy to defeat to them but also to die because of them. Honestly the boss fights are much easier than getting through the dungeons. The patterns of all bosses can be easily avoided when using a bow and arrow to fight them. Once they idle you can do a lot of damage to them with a strong direct weapon. But the bosses are really easy in my opinion. You might need one or two tries to understand their pattern but once you learn how to avoid taking damage or take enough health potions with you there's nothing stopping you. I beat the 3rd boss on my first try without even preparing for it and just entering the boss room just to see what the fight looks like. And I'm not that good at dungeon crawlers. If you're a dungeon crawler lover looking for a challenge this isn't the game for you.The shop elements of the game are somewhat lackluster. You place an item you price it and then the customers will react to it. You basically have to guess the price of an item and it'll make you lose a lot of good money in the beginning if you want to play the game the way it was meant to be. I'd recommend using a price guide some specific items later on are incredibly valuable and it's very easy to sell them at 0.1% of their actual price. Honestly though the items in the last dungeon are too valuable and you'll make too much gold that you'll never find any use for. I think I beat the game while having 2m in gold left. It is justified through the story you're the second (or third given that there's another merchant selling the same items as you) person to ever enter the last dungeon and thus everyone is willing to pay a lot of gold for these items. I just hope that future updates include new upgrades or just something new to do with your leftover gold.Running the shop itself is also kinda boring. You just stand at the cash register and accept people buying your items. If you idle and don't accept they will just take the items with them and leave the shop. There are also multiple thieves that can come to your shop. You have a prompt to tackle them and get the stolen item back so if you see someone with a thief symbol come into your shop you should accept all ongoing sales and then follow them around. Later on you can upgrade the shop and get more display cases requests and an additional employee but it's just not as exciting as a typical shop simulation management game could be. And it doesn't have to be since it's not that kind of game but seeing how the dungeon crawler element isn't really difficult or long I just wish there would be a little bit more to the shop and the town life. The town itself does offer upgrades as well. You can pay for more shops to appear like a blacksmith and a potion brewer but they all just benefit yourself and don't affect anything else. I really enjoyed the game but it just feels empty. Like the NPCs could have their own ongoing story that develops with each dungeon you beat. But they just have little quirks they repeat. That doesn't change the quality of the game and make it boring I just think there's so much more potential in the game.The one thing about the game that I didn't like was the story or more specifically the ending to it. You start off as a shopkeeper trying to follow his granddad's footsteps and discover the secrets of the dungeons. Your mentor is worried about you since he's already seen someone take on more than they could handle. But you push on and open the fifth door. I'm not going to spoil the story here but there's no emotional payoff for the story. What you find behind that door is so random that it ruins everything the game has built up. It seems like they tried to copy another incredible popular RPG with it but that ending just doesn't fit with this story. The game is a lot of fun but you get excited to see where the story goes and the ending is just kinda dumb and meaningless. The ending is about how the dungeons got there and it makes sense to explain it no matter how weird your explanation for it is but to not have any payoff for the emotional conflict? It was a letdown for me.Overall I recommend this game to anyone who wants to experience a nice adventure game with a story and maybe someone who wants to test out a simple dungeon crawler game for the first time. The game is complete as it is but seeing the developers work on more content and different modes gives me hope that the current problems will also get some attention.,Moonlighter
2018-06-15,0,0,4,False,Not Recommended,"It's sad to give this a ""not recommended"" because there's a lot to like in Moonlighter. It's not really a ""bad"" game but there's not a lot of depth to it and it has a huge number of small annoyances that end up making the game feel incredibly clumsy to play.The shop mechanics are... fine but you basically do the same thing with every type of item. Figure out the best price for the item (you do this by semi randomly trying out different prices unitl the customers show a certain face) then put all the you don't think you need up for sale at that best price. You sit in your shop and wait for customers to come in bring an item to you then you hit A. Occasionally a shopliflter will come in and you have to run and stop them after which the item falls on the ground and you have to re put it up for sale. There's just not a lot going on in this section of the game.So is the combat worth it? Well... kinda. It's again fine but nothing special. You have a few different types of weapons (which can be upgraded in town). There's an alternative attack (which is usually a super underpowered charge attack) and a normal attack. You can also dodge roll. The enemies look nice and aren't terrible to fight but something feels just a bit too slow and awkward about the fighting.You also have to do constant inventory management during your dungeon runs. There are 3 floors to each dungeon but you'll probably be full after 75% of the first floor. This means that after every room you're often opening your inventory trying to figure out which stuff to dump (you can convert all objects to money while in the dungeon) and then going to the next room. This really breaks up any attempts at ""flow"" and the sheer NUMBER of different items is really silly. They tried to mix things up with an ""item curse"" system where some items have to be placed in specific spots or other items destroy items in certain adjacent slots if you return to town but this system doesn't really work at all it just makes the whole process more annoying (you can't stack ""normal"" items with cursed variants).And the small nitpicks... there are so many small things that get in the way of enjoying the game. Want to craft healing potions? Select the potion hit A on the potion move the cursor from ""no"" to ""yes"" hit A again wait for a short animation. Now repeat if you wanted more than 1 potion (which you always do). Upgrading your shop or adding a merchant? Get locked in an awkward animation where a random builder guy SLOWLY walks from off screen to where the shop will be the screen fades out then again the builder SLOWLY walks back off screen. Have an item held in your cursor and try to swap it out with another item? The item doesn't come into your cursor it goes to where the original item was so now you have to move back to that item to move it again. No way to quick sell items in the inventory No mouse support at all so you can't really speed up inventory management Buying items doesn't remove them from your ""wishlist"" so you have to do that manually Upgrading/decorating your shop seems interesting at first but the impact it has feels very minimal The dungoen design is really repetitive and no rooms really feel unique in any way. ""harder"" enemy variants are the exact same but just do more damage and have more health Many enemies can be cheesed extremely easily by hitting them through the solid level pieces with your weapon ""Story"" text that you find in the dungeons repeats itself and you can't skip them once you've started reading them (and there are a few that are 10+ dialog boxes worth of text). Each ""run"" feels extremely similar as you don't get any mid run upgradesI could go on for more. The art is great the sound/music is fine but man the game is lacking in actual fun design.",Moonlighter
2018-05-29,8,662,21,False,Not Recommended,This... is hard for me. I kickstarted this game and loved every bit of the premise of it. I wanted something like Recettear and to be fair I got that... (to an extent.) I want to see the genre succeed and expand considerably. I want more games like it. But with that said I had some core issues with this game. Perhaps you won't have those sorts of issues so please read through before deciding not to buy based on this. I still want to see the game flourish and grow.Pros Beautiful art style.An entry into a very rare genre not easy to scratch that itch.Rouguelike procedurally generated so layouts won't get repetetive.Can be an interesting challenge if you let it.The story is told indirectly through item descriptions and notes.Cons Small like a well but sadly so very shallow.Almost no items have a use beyond 20 or so to make weapons and armor.Weapons and armor are very small in number and no depth or customizability to them.The shopkeeping is very simplistic learn a price set it wait for someone to buy it. That's all.Short. 4 real dungeons 3 floors each and when you know what you're doing it can take something like 5 hours to beat.Combat wasn't overly satisfying. The bosses might have been fun but a couple of weapons can trivialize most encounters. Even when playing on the hardest difficulty.Relatively buggy. The devs chose not to beta test anything beyond the first build and dungeon of the game. This has a cost in bugs unfortunately with performance issues crashes softlocks and the like.In the end... there was just next to nothing to do. It felt so hollow... I wanted depth and complexity but instead I got a lot of pretty art with some sprinkled gameplay. In the beginning I thought the tighter focus on a smaller area would mean there'd be a lot to explore within those areas to do to spend the money you make on. But really there isn't. No big payoff. No real reward. Even the story sort of hangs you out to dry at the end.I really do hope I get to change this review into a glowing one before the end. I really *want* to love this game as much as I loved Recettear... but unless it gets a whole lot more depth I simply cannot recommend it at this time.,Moonlighter
2018-06-01,2,181,8,False,Not Recommended,"It's fun for a while but it's shallow and there's not a lot of content. It feels like the basic framework that could've been vastly expanded upon but right now it's lot of very basic gameplay systems.You have your procedurely generatored dungeons with 4 different environments and bosses (the bosses CANNOT be refought in any way a very strange decision for a rogue lite game). Enemies get slightly stronger on every floor with 4 floors per dungeon and they drop items you can sell or craft with.You have your standard overhead 2D combat with lite and charge attacks on 5 different weapons. You do not gain extra combat abilities as the game goes on and the weapons only do more damage or sidegrade to some light status effects. Combat stays the same.You have your shop in which you ostensibly play a merchant putting things on sale but really this isn't much different than selling things to a vendor in other games just slower. Every item has an internal best price you can sell to your customers at and once you find it that's it. There's an ""item popularity"" mechanic but it doesn't affect much of anything. There's shop customization but it's much shallower than in Recettear. You can basically just expand the space and install items to provide flat bonuses. There is no customization of shop ambiance to attract different customers or cosmetic touches.There's crafting which basically means you pay money at the town billboard to unlock shops before you can buy from them. The village outside your shop is pretty lifeless with a lot of nameless NPCs that have 1 3 lines of dialogue that never change. Some inexplicably have portraits hinting that NPC stories or quests that were planned but never put in. Weapons crafting is also very strange in that you can craft completely separate lines of either Physical or Elemental based weapons but the elemental weapons have a specific element per tier so you can't have say a fire based elemental weapon of the highest level only lightning. This is a hugely missed opporunity to beef up the enchanting system which only allows you to buy a flat attack damage or defense upgrade to your weapons/armor.In short a bunch of different gameplay elements mixed together can be more than the sum of its parts but this doesn't happen in Moonlighter. Everything feels very separate and still basic. The combat starts ok and fails to get more interesting the dungeons start ok and then just become very easy as you learn without any major surprises. The boss fights are fun but there's only 4 + the final boss and you can't do a boss rush or replay the fights. The shop only has one or two mechanics behind it for the entire game. There's an interesting concept here but the devs were only able to do the minimum with it.",Moonlighter
2018-06-02,5,222,11,False,Not Recommended,Games like this make me hate steams review system. The game is fun but it's pretty lacklustre to be honest. Only 5 bosses randomly generated maps paper thin story line barely engaging shop system and the most straight forward weapons and armor you've ever seen. Have you seen the trailer? Well you've pretty much seen everything worth seeing as far as story is concerned. The rest is basically an old man who tells you to stay outta the dungeons constantly well the ending is weird. There are various notes hinting at a deeper storyline but they're kinda disjointed and uninteresting. Mainly because what they actually reveal in the end is kinda stupid. The monsters are pretty good solid enemies. Lot's of creative patterns. The bosses are also consistent and solid challenges. The main problem is that you can pretty much just buy your way through any dungeons you're having trouble with. As the game goes on your income becomes stupidly high and every time you return from a dungeon without dieing you can make a massive profit. Then you can just upgrade or enchant your weapons load your inventory up with potions and then the whole dungeon is basically free. That brings us to the next problem the over simplified weapon and armor choices. They literally boil down to do you want armor that makes you 1)faster with weak defense2)average speed average defense3)slower with stronger defense. Those are LITERALLY your armor choices. And your weapons aren't much better. Everything about this game is over simplified. They figured since they were basically making a game with two different concepts they could skimp on both. Whether it's the shopping or the combat neither one is anywhere near complete.,Moonlighter
2018-08-01,3,47,12,False,Recommended,"Moonlighter is first and foremost a dungeon crawling game with strong memories of Legend of Zelda. Meanwhile the shop management segment will rarely have you shouting ""Capitalism ho!""PROS + Would you wrap your eyes around those pixels It looks quite nice! The bosses and monsters all look colourful and impressive and everything moves with a silky smoothness that is both pleasant and delightful.+ Inventory Management? Somehow they've made inventory management fun and puzzling! Trying to avoid all of your items exploding in a fit of curses turns the whole experience into it's own little puzzle to solve+ Keep your belly to the floor in those dungeons! As you're dungeon... crawling. It's fun. They're effective and interesting and there's a constant tension as you go for one more room only to die and lose everything.CONS Shopkeeper? I hardly know her! The shop keeping aspect is incredibly light and lacking. Working out the right price for an item is fun but it ends there immediately. There's not much going on in your shop. Help I'm part of the 1% and don't know what to do Money money money could be funny in a rich man's world. You'll have lots of money too much money. There's nothing to spend it on. Upgrading your equipment only costs so much so why are you really selling anything? There's a lack of soul In the most capitalistic aspect of the game it feels like it just lacks sense of soul. The town itself is devoid of personality and you rarely interact with another character outside of Old Man Jenkins. Haven't I been here before? The dungeons do become a little repetitive as all you eventually want to do is progress to the next dungeon but you've got to go through yet another full dungeon run to get to the final floor aaaaaah.Moonlighter is by no means bad it's ""alright"". It's shop management aspect suffers heavily from just having very little managment to it. Honestly I'd rather have the well known game from 2007 as at least that didn't have the option to hire someone else to do the shop keeping aspect for you removing half of the game.

2018-06-23,9,232,18,False,Not Recommended,"Good game idea addictive gameplay let down by poor controls inconsistent hit detection on inbound damage a multitude of softlocks and an overall lack of polish in terms of input handling and UI.Poor controls 8 way movement but only 4 way facing. Makes positive use of the analog stick tricky when you move diagonal is subject to finnicky zones cutting between up/down or left/right movement alongside diagonal movement. When using the d pad diagonal movement always faces the character up or down never left or right making targeting a hassle. Ledges are finnicky. Sometimes you fall down a pit with practically no provocation sometimes you have to lean on it for half a second before you actually jump down. Rolling over double wides in anything but ideal conditions has about even odds of you seeing the other side vs. seeing the door you came in on. Incoming damage is extremely unpredictable. Sometimes projectiles will hit hard cover sometimes they'll burst through it like it's not even there what finally set me off that it wasn't me was the fact that standing in the exact same location behind a pillar two long wise lava streams passed me... the first one missing completely the second nailing me. The register in the store can be tempermental sometimes requiring repositioning three or four times before allowing sales to a waiting customer.Poor UI A keyboard is also cool not. While I could get to the menu with the keyboard/gamepad switch option I was unable to figure out which key to press to actually get the UI to switch to the keyboard controls so I could see the rest of them. Gave up and just plugged in a gamepad. No ""sort my storage/inventory"" option. No ""repack my storage/inventory"" option. Walking into the dungeon resets any teleport you might have set without warning and without any ability to get it back. The teleport by your shop is just far enough out of eyeshot that it's quite possible to make it out of town without noticing you have a port up. With no fast way to switch cursor between storage and inventory when placing cursed items and causing items to be switched between inventories when over placing directly that ""mini game"" becomes bounds more tedious and much less enjoyable than it otherwise would be. No min/max recording in the merchant book regarding price reactions making finding the highest ""ideal"" price mildly obnoxious. Price reactions frequently fail to be recorded in the merchant book making finding the highest ""ideal"" price an active headache. Price bubbles on tables' lower items cover up the item above them making keeping track of what's actually out/on sale an annoyance. Trying to cursor in the up direction to the top left storage inventory slot causes the UI to switch to the previous chest instead of selecting the desired topmost leftmost item Not being able to save and put the game down at any time is an annoyance. Wishlisted item components show as wishlisted... even when they're supposed to be ""unknown.""Silver linings GREAT choice to allow crafting with vendors so long as you own the items needed they don't have to be in your inventory. GREAT choice to allow wishlisting stuff so you don't accidentally sell necessary crafting materials.Patched to a moderate degree could easily be worth the asking price of $20 but In its current state only a $5 game.

2018-12-24,25,588,865,False,Recommended,So here's a simplified list of what you'll find in Terraria This is a 2D RPG with platformer and sandbox elements It has an incredible amount of content to it Multiple classes that are shaped through armor bonuses (but you can use other items not of your class) Idk like a billion items? Lots of weapons armor cosmetics and building material. It's crazy A good healthy serving of cool and interesting bosses to fight Lots of NPC's to buy stuff from (be ready to build basically a hotel for the like 30 of them in the game now) Really good retro soundtrack but more modern that fit the creative environments they pair with. Boss fight music gets you pumped! Is it too easy for you? Try Expert mode! Don't feel like you're penalized enough for dying? Set your character to Hardcore! I almost forgot to mention SO MUCH CRAFTINGCons? Hmm. Inventory management the abundance of items will overwhelm you. I usually make a structure dedicated to storing all my loot in chests. Stay organized! Fishing is pretty useful but well it s not exactly exciting. You can get some great stuff that way though. Expect a big difficulty spike after defeating the boss in the Underworld! You ll feel like a noob all over again but once you work past it is where the game feels like it truly begins for me. Some items in the game are pretty rare and some of these rares are used to craft or otherwise obtain some of the best loot in the game. Other thought If you can play with friends or find people to run through the game with do it. It's much more fun that way. You can still enjoy it quite a bit single player however... it's not the same when you can't laugh when someone gets destroyed by a boulder trap.Story time (if you want to torture yourself and read my rambling) I bought this game ages ago back when it was still in development before any of the expansions and cleanups it's gone through. I spent $10 on this.Since then the Dev team (at least back in 2014 2015 or so when I kept up with it) would post threads about once a month at the least to let people know what was planned/ the progress of the game. It kept getting updated adding more content and mechanics. I remember being super excited when new weapon types were added rare mounts were added. Accessories so your character can fly around the map? Gimme. Something I always admire too is Re Logic did not simply focus on adding more stuff end game they kept polishing up early game too adding things like Ropes to make things easier until you get hookshots simple versions of weapons you find later like Spears wooden yo yo more early game magic items. It used to be a much less enjoyable slower grind to get to mid game content where the pace picks up.There were at least a couple times where the development with the game was supposedly going to halt and I was satisfied with it then. I'd gotten more content and enjoyment out of Terraria than most games I'd bought for $30 or more. Yet somehow maybe a year after hearing nothing a new content update would surprisingly be pushed out. This happened at least twice when I thought it would be laid to rest as is. I spent $10 on this.,Terraria
2017-05-28,23,880,391,False,Recommended,Honestly I don't know why Terraria has so many haters. This game literally has everything. Fun to play tons of things to do bosses to kill ofc it has multiplayer so you can enjoy everything with friends items to farm a lot of stuff and decorations to build with not to mention that if you hit the bottom and feel like you have completed the game you can install some mods adding a crazy amount of new features items ect ... When you're ingame (and I don't really know how to explain it) there's just something very chilling about it maybe it's the music maybe it's just every little detail about it. That's just how the game works. Perfect for chilling when you had a bad or exhausting day but it's also the perfect entertainment for your free time. 10/10,Terraria

2017-06-07,131,3532,113,False,Recommended,You feel an evil presence watching you... This is the sort of game that you boot up thinking you'll spend an hour or two on only to one day wake up face down on your keyboard surrounded by bottles and plates wondering where the past 3 weeks went. 100 hours in and I've still not defeated the current 'final' boss something that's a mixture of the games' excellent difficulty curve and a melancholy realisation that once I defeat him my time with the game will naturally come to an end. Primarily Terraria is a sandbox game. You appear in a new world with some basic equipment and no real instruction eventually you will build a small house to survive the monsters that surface during the night discover some form of corruption eating away at the world encounter new NPCs and face off against powerful Boss enemies. Despite all this you are given little direction these are merely facets of a larger game that allows players to do as they wish encountering all the world has to offer at mostly their own pace. Part of the great design behind the title is in the difficulty curve I mentioned earlier meaning challenges pitted against a player start easy and steadily increase at a rate easy to handle. Although traditional RPG elements are largely absent a discrete levelling system is present in the form of Bosses that have been defeated meaning if you don't progress through these enemies then the gameplay doesn't become more difficult. In fact the first boss doesn't spawn until you're suitably equipped with armour and health. My hours in the game are split roughly equally between single and multiplayer. Single player stands up on its own perfectly fine but in my opinion the game is much more rewarding gathering some friends and working together to tackle the bosses as the feeling of reaching new goals is shared and the ammount of 'grinding' for materials is spread across multiple people. It also helps to appreciate the brilliant soundtrack as if you voice chat with your group then spontaneous humming along loudly is to be expected. Enemy design is exciting and unique with floating eyes possessed suits of armour giant robotic worms and a ninja suspended in a giant ball of slime all making appearances. That being said whoever on the design team is responsible for 'hellbats' has earned a special sort of hatred from myself...All in all Terraria is an amazing experience from beginning to end its tone is humourous at times whist still provoking a feeling of wonderment and mystery in its exploration and fearful excitement at its combat. It's a game I will come back to time and time again looking to recapture the memories I've made and to forge new ones. It is a rare game in that with no shred of a doubt these hours I have spent were not wasted. I heartily recommend that you purchase this game. Fortune and glory kid...,Terraria
2016-05-17,23,272,1132,False,Recommended,"This review applies to Terraria 1.3.0.8 and earlier.The essence of Terraria is that it prioritizes fun! It's not a game where players must fear losing progress due to forgetting safety measures or manage breakable tools. The game knows how to bring out a sense of enjoyment and achievement. Grinding is an option not a requirement or an excuse to drag out game time. Besides there is much to discover and do in the game. Clocking in at 1 000+ hours having all 88 achievements and introducing multiple friends to the game should be indicative of that. With that being said I'll list some pros/cons I've found memorable.Pros Customization There is a staggering amount of customization available in game. You not only can choose from several basic character designs but also have a plethora of armors costumes accessories and pets for your character. You can also color/dye any of your equipment and get all sorts of flashy effects. Dyes aren't consumable so you have few restrictions on perfecting your assemblage. Exploration The Terraria world may be finite but it is incredibly diverse. Each biome has its own personality and houses many unique elements. It takes a minimum of three worlds to discover everything and that's only with absurd luck (see ""The Creation of the Guide"" painting). The game additionally has an impressive number of flavor. That rubble on the ground can be dug up and a Worm might pop out from it. You can reignite the burnt out Campfire in that small cavern. You didn't think that NPCs could fend for themselves during a Blood Moon or invasion did you? Just when you think you've learned everything about the Terraria world you discover something surprising. Creativity Terraria is as much as about creating your world as it is exploring it. Blocks and furniture are not just for aesthetics but they also introduce some neat mechanics. Players looking to engineer stuff will enjoy the contraptions possible by the wiring mechanic and designers will love being able to paint the overworld with a wide spectrum of colors. Terraria features innovative design at its finest. Progression options Like any good RPG there's a great sense of progress made in a playthrough. You mine or slay enemies for the materials needed to upgrade equipment and the world is bountiful enough that this progress never feels linear or constrained. Even the achievements flow nicely never feeling too easy cheap or absurdly difficult. You never need to rely crutch items to make progress. Rather in my experience my friends and I frequently had too many options and had to reluctantly store away some of our neat loot. There is always something to switch to if a playstyle becomes easy or repetitive. Balance A game can become boring if there is a certain playstyle players fall into. Terraria manages to find the right balance so that all playstyles have a fair shot at completing the game. There is no bottleneck or singular Infinity+1 Sword needed for progress. Diversity Terraria promotes itself as a game for any type of player and that claim certainly has truth in it. The game has gameplay suited for battlers explorers and builders and I can also tack on several options that appeal to other types of players. Collectors will balk at the quantity of items and achievements offered and players can challenge themselves to make progress with nearly any conduct. Play with only melee/ranged/magic/summoning weapons? Sure. A yo yo only run? That's popular! No crafting/mining? Certainly. Play the entire game upside down? Of course and that's bug free! If that's not enough you can fire up a world in Expert Mode for the extra challenge. There's something for everyone. I've had a friend who would ask on his first playthrough 'Can I do ____ in the game?' and I could answer in the positive the majority of the time. Just for starters you can teleport build trap filled dungeons set up PVP minigames and record the soundtrack. The game's breadth is incredible. Automation Terraria would be daunting without any form of automation. You have thousands of items hundreds of monsters dozens of mechanics and an expansive world to build on or dig through. The game offers much to ease the burden of management. Auto select picks the right tool rather than requiring manual selection. The smart cursor allows for one click digging. Quick stacking is much more convenient than depositing items one by one chest by chest. Farming is not only feasible but easy. Making measured builds is simplified with items like the Ruler. The game naturally provides the player ease of use tools so a playthrough can be focused on the fun stuff rather than on chores. Performance Many games fall off a prospective player's wishlist due to system requirements. Terraria is a game that features a crazy amount of sprites particle effects physics lighting and entity interaction. Being a 2 D game only nets you that much speed before optimizations come into play *cough*Starbound*cough*. The game's requirements are reasonable and the gameplay is optimized such that it doesn't require a bulky system to run on. I was able to run it decently on a 2007 year old desktop on Windows XP with low end specifications. The performance of the game to medium and some low end systems makes it accessible to a broad demographic of players. On the other hand if you have a high end system go ahead and fire up that Color lighting mode and enjoy Terraria in its full glory. Quality of life Many games have little quirks that people have to accept to enjoy. Not only is Terraria's gameplay mainly devoid of bugs but it also buffs out these quirks. Players are separated from worlds allowing for easy singleplayer to multiplayer transfer. Characters can ascend blocks without needing to jump. Chests containing items don't explode if you try to harvest them. Keys are easily remappable for those familiar with alternate control schemes. Quick stacking skips 'favorite' items. You can use the in game system for taking wide screenshots for giant builds. You can set player configurations to ease the smallest of annoyances. In general you never feel you're fighting the game's controls and interface. Continued updates It would be very easy for Terraria as popular as it is to offer game expansions as paid DLC. The developers instead make their continued updates absolutely free to owners of the game. The developer community relationship is superb.Cons New player friendliness The in game help system is stunted and players can easily become overwhelmed by the ever growing number of toys in Terraria's sandbox. Many people resort to a guide to help them through the game. Grinding While the game does not require noticeable grinding to progress several tangents in the game require patience and luck. That fancy teleportation item pretty much necessitates a farm in the Hallow. The last component of a PDA could be hundreds of monster drops or fishing quests away. At a rate of one quest per in game day the 200 fishing quests achievement would require 4 800 minutes (3 1/3 days) to complete without resorting to tricks. It can be frustrating to have an achievement be left incomplete as a stretch yet Terraria is not above this issue. Moddability Terraria is extensive enough that it doesn't need additional features but people have been able to decode the game and develop external software and mods for a better game experience. It would be a boon if the game was open to the modding community for extended gameplay.",Terraria

2017-11-22,0,0,184,False,Recommended,One of the best RPG of all times!Lots of possibilities for roleplay and building schematics.You want a big castle? Gather resources and build!Feeling an urge to be a pirate? Dress like one and construct a ship!Always wanted to be a mad scientist? Design an underground lab and pretend to keep NPCs as test subjects!Terraria gives us a lot of fun time a lot of hit&amp dodge fights and generally an infinite patterns for building your own town only limited by your imagination. Your efficiency in fighting depends on time spent on gathering resources but mainly on your own skill + instinct + unique tactics.There are basically 4 hero classes melee fighter marksman mage and summoner all depending on your choice of equipment.Boss fights require enormous focus and audacity as well as (usually) many tries to resolve what kind of tactics you should pick.Developers still keep on updating the game providing players with new stuff to toy with. Summary You need a game limited only by your imagination which requires lots of time to become the ultimate master? THIS GAME IS FOR YOU!,Terraria
2018-05-23,0,0,290,False,Recommended,This game brings some of my most creative side out and i'm pretty thankful for it since i like to get caught up in doing my own work. I tend to get carried away when i'm only doing a few houses and stuff The HUD may seem weird to some people but you tend to get used to that pretty quickly. You may seem lost on what to do but if you talk to the Guide (Right click him) He can give you advice that helps you out through out the entire game.,Terraria

2018-07-30,0,0,503,False,Recommended,"With a wealth of existing content dedicated developers who periodically release free updates and a bustling mod community steadily churning out high quality mods Terraria is one of the best value for money purchases you can make on Steam. The game itself is a 2D side scrolling action adventure with a strong emphisis on spelunking looting monster slaying mining crafting and character progression and a secondary emphisis on base construction. The character progression itself is a minor marvel of game design with almost everything being tied not to your character or an arbitrary level but to the weapons armor and tools you have built for yourself and the way the world around you reacts to your gear with progressively tougher enemies and harder to mine materials intuitively informing the player when it is time to upgrade to new gear and with hundreds of weapons/tools and dozens of armor sets to create thousands of materials to gather and dozens of environments enemies and boss monsters to extract them from there is indeed nearly always something new to create.Its tempting to dub Terraria as just ""2D Minecraft"" but dont be fooled its similarities are purely superficial this game perfects everything that minecraft merely conceptualized and has since outgrown and outclassed its distant voxel based cousin in almost every regard.Simply put one of the best video games on PC.",Terraria

2017-06-02,10,434,1155,False,Recommended,I have played this game for 1 055 hours.This is an amazing game. It's ability to make people gravitate back to it after an update is very nice. Speaking of updates the developers release amazing and wholesome updates from time to time. I really recommend this game for mainly two reasons it has a great replay ability were you just keep making worlds and playing it over and over again. The other reason is that you can do a lot of stuff with the world. From making giant houses and contraptions to attempting to kill a boss multiple times it is a fun game. But it is also multiplayer which is a great addition. Playing by yourself can get boring sometimes but when I play this game with my friends I just can't stop playing. I really recommend this game it is definitely worth the 10 dollars.,Terraria
2018-08-04,13,210,85,False,Recommended,I d only wish I had played this game sooner!Terraria if a fascinating game that introduces players to an open 2D world that features adventure building crafting boss battles and much more. As a player who had experienced the vanilla and the mod variant I ll be commenting for both game experiences.The vanilla original game present you with the basic components of how to play. While it can be a grind at the start to gather materials to build in the later game you ll be introduced to more content new areas enemies and NPCs. The game is hugely focused on progression which makes it quite an addiction to play. My favorite aspects of the game are the weapons and gear plus the boss battles. No item is ever the same as well as the monsters that we face. The aesthetics are also nice the Plantera mask and kimono were one of my personal favorites to dress for my character. Lots of items in the game are customizable including colour changes to upgrades for bonus stats.Now for the mod version there were even more available content for players. The mods my friends and I played with on his server were namely the Thorium Mod and Calamity mod. These mods added features such as more boss monsters items NPC and more. Some players will frown at mods and call it cheats and whatnot. However this is not the case as it brings more complexity to the original game and it's not intended for new players anyways. We played on Expert/Revengeance mode and fought additional bosses like Astrium Deus and the Siren and Leviathan. In my experience the modded variation provided and even more thrilling challenge than the Vanilla version. I recommend trying it after you ve completed the original game.In general Terraria is a must play for anyone who hasn t done so.,Terraria

With almost 2000 hours on the game i can say it is the best game ive played there are many bosses and mini bosses in the game that you will enjoy fighting. There is thousands of items and weapons in the game from a simple copper sword to a Sword that shoots out cats. If you have already beaten the game you can evn replay it on expert mode and have a whole new expierience and have all that fun over again but much much harder. And if you played through the whole game and you just dont want to play more normal terraria you can download mods although not through the workshop you can download the tmod loader and have acces to 100s of mods that can more than double the weapons and items in the game or even just get a mod to make the game even harder.,Terraria

2018-06-28,0,0,111,False,Recommended,Don't let the Minecraft comparisons put you off. Whilst Terraria is based on collecting materials and crafting this is a very different game. There is a very definate path to follow and campaign to progress through with increasingly powerful gear. You can play as a melee ranged magic or summoning based warrior and defeat over a dozen bosses. In addition to building yourself up it pays to build you own town/settlement and attract other characters. These additions offer many different invaluable skills and items to help you along.Everything is very well balanced and when you get stuck there is always more items and equipment to work towards. If I had one complaint it would be that progressing through the game isn't very intuitive. Unless you plan on a lot of experimenting and trial and error with the crafting guide I would recommend keeping the Terraria Wiki to hand.,Terraria

2018-07-26,0,0,1115,False,Recommended,"Ah yes... Terraria the game that is oftenly called a ""2D Minecraft"" even though it is much better than the one it's supposedly copying. Terraria is a fantastic game made by a team of developers who really love their job and actually care about their game as a real game and not as a product or a money making machine. It is hard to put on words why Terraria is so great and why it can keep you playing for as long as i did. First things first let's start the breakdown. Do note that this review was written when Terraria was in it's version 1.3.5.3.GRAPHICS Excellent.For a 2D pixel game the graphics on it are Fantastically made everything looks incredibly detailed and splendid it's hard to find stuff in it that stands out as being particularly ugly although some enemies come close not because of bad art but because the enemies themselves are ugly as all bloody hell. Although you probably won't have enough time to enjoy the graphics when you're shooting stuff up. SOUNDTRACK Great.The soundtrack in this game is unique and charming every piece of it is a work of art in and of itself everything in the game has some music to go along it although.... when you've played the same game for over 500 hours listening to the same songs you're gonna get tired because of the strongness that the soundtrack comes in it enchances the experience in a very delightful way but after playing for so long you grow tired of it because it's the same music over and over again.So for the first few hundred hours it's awesome but after that it starts getting repetitive so i just reccomend that you go on the internet and find some remixes which are easy to do since the entire soundtrack is conveniently packed into one simple file that you can replace at any time (Except when the game is open of course) and it will change all the musics with the game being tasked of playing the tracks as it needs to.GAMEPLAY Nailed It.The gameplay is fenomenal and there's so much you can do in this game that you'll easily lose weeks of your life trying to do all the stuff you can do. Of course everytime you start a new save file it is the same thing but it's never exactly the same thing there's always a difference even though almost everything stays the same. But don't expect that just because everything stays the same that your is not gonna get kicked let me tell you this game holds your hand less than dark souls this game is un forgiving and ruthless at the same time it's gonna kick your and once you're down on the ground stomp on your balls a couple of times it will only do it if you let it. This game requires a lot of skill in fast reflexes and critical thinking but there are still a lot of things you can use to make your life much easier. And once you start getting tired of the same old just grab yourself a backpack and go explore the forums for some mods. Some mods that i particularly reccomend are Thorium JoostMod AlchemistNPC and More Pets Mod. VARIETY Plentiful.This game oozes variety theres a really expansive assortment of weapons accessories and armors that you can use but also a giant ammount of possibilities in building furnituring and even the enemies have a lot of variations specially the zombies and the demon eyes those two combined togheter have over 30 variations! That's a f*ck ton of them! Every thing you can do has at least 4 ways about doing it the possibilities are endless and you will never get tired if you keep exploring them all. STORY What story?There is no story.... well at least not as much of a story as ""Just shoot whatever you see"" so i can't rate this part. MULTIPLAYER Perfect.If you know me you know that on my circles i praise and praise and praise Terraria's Multiplayer to no end it's the quintessential ""Best Designed Multiplayer"" for me There is very little that the game actually changes about multiplayer but what it lacks in differences it more than makes up by your own options you can choose to join one of 6 teams (Might have been expanded in the future) And get this every player has their own setting about PvP the PvP aspect isn't a focus of terraria anyway but having the ability to toggle PvP on and off at will without losing your offensive capabilities (Looking at you GTA Online) or anything for that matter is a big plus for me which i hope many survival games out there would adopt it although i know Terraria is a Sandbox and not a Survival per se but it really brings my to a boil in survivals when people just kill eachother instead of.. you know trying to actually survive anyway This system is f*cking wonderful not only that but some weapons behave differently when used in PvP for balance pourposes like every homing weapon that do not home on players. Bottom line Multiplayer is a guranteed Certificate of Quality.CONCLUSION 12/13This game is impeccable and undescribably good if you haven't played it yet go and play it you won't regret it.I can't say anything else about this game because what else can i say that hasn't already be said if you are reading this you haven't bought the game yet and if you haven't bought the game yet GO DO SO ALREADY FOR F*CKS SAKE!",Terraria

2016-01-10,0,0,640,False,Recommended,Now see some people don't like this game. Most of these people swear by minecraft. Terraria however is a totally different game. Do people refer to it as a 2D version of Minecraft? Well yes and in some ways that's exactly what it is. Let's do a compare/contrast though. Minecraft Terraria 3D 2D Randomly generated open world environment Randomly generated limited linear environment Crafting system with limitless building capabilities Crafting system with limitless building capabilites The occasional village or randomly generated dungeon Various NPCs that are unlocked through the game each with specific capabilities Open roaming with loose storyline with abstractly located dungeons temples etc. Open roaming with a definate goal multiple quests and dungeons temples and more 26 mobs in 1.3.1 Over a hundred mobs One world one character Characters can be taken from one world and ported to any other world you have made with any items on them One or two bosses throughout the game Triggerable boss battles hard mode and events such as 'Goblin army' and 'blood moon' A basic monetary system based on trading in villages based around mineable emeralds A complex monetary system with shops coins in mobs and unique items And more than I could ever put in my piddly little review. I love the game and recommend it to anyone who A. Gets lost ALL THE TIME in minecraftB. Has a computer which can't quite handle the graphics of minecraftC. Loves crafting survival games like MinecraftD. Wants to buy the gameE. Everyone else.,Terraria
2017-01-27,0,0,260,False,Recommended,Terraria is a fun exploration crafting survival game the combat is clean and fun mainly 4 classes summoner ranged melee and magic the loot grind is kind of like a mmo where you grind a certain enemy or boss to get the certain loot you want after almost 300 hours of gameplay i had to unglue myself from it as there is almost unlimited things to build and do in the game and if you want all the items weapon and vanity its no easy task to do so I beat every boss and the entire game on expert hard mode it was a blast!!!! story is bland but that how all voxel games are its best played with friends!!

This game is what you're looking for.I always pick this up every year and start a fresh character playing again and absolutely become addicted to it everytime. While the startup is slow (just like Minecraft mind you) when you start progressing through the game it really speeds up.,Terraria
2015-09-22,0,0,586,False,Recommended,This game shows people what minecraft could be. Minecraft is a great sandbox game but has nothing beyond being sandbox. Terraria takes that gameplay style and gives it a story and sense of progression/goals. If you were interested in Minecraft at any point but stopped because you got bored this game is for you. Would recommend to anyone though adult or child (though if you're really bad at video games then you might have trouble completing it).,Terraria
2018-02-23,21,171,792,False,Recommended,"Terraria at first glance can be called a ""2D Minecraft"" from some viewers but it surprisingly has a lot of differences.For starters while Terraria is indeed a 2D sandbox game the main highlight of the game isn't just creating whatever you want but working your way up from basic equipment up to fighting space invaders and SQUIDLORD. ..er excuse me the ""Moon Lord"".Speaking of equipment at no point what so ever do your tools or armor ever break. There's also currency in the form of bronze silver gold and platinum coins which can be used to buy goods from friendly NPCs. Said friendly NPCs can appear if you fufill certain conditions and have a vacent room for them. So on and so forth there are many differences between this and Minecraft that makes the whole comparison silly to bring up.Though I won't be praising everything about the game as it does have some flaws. For starters while the PC version has no tutorial every other version of the game has one. There are console and mobile exclusive events items and even music which was a personal pet peeve for me. Some accessories made from combining others together end up being less useful than if you were to use the two seperately or create an entirely different accessory the fishing achievements are quite a nightmare to go after and the beginning can be VERY tedious especially in Expert Mode. Throwing weapons are also useless past the Wall of Flesh with a majority of items involving throwing capabilities being thrown out of the window by the time Skeletron comes around.Do these gripes of mine hinder the experience as a whole?I don't think so and I still think the game is worth checking out if you're into games such as this.An additional bonus there's also a pretty awesome modding community for the game too which adds even more things you can do with the game long after you taken care of the vanilla game's final boss. Some recommended mods to check out would be Leveled Thorium and Calamity.I'd highly recommend getting Terraria if you haven't yet especially if it's on sale. Though I would also recommend playing the game with friends as it's muuuuuuch more fun and also not as tedious. ..maybe.",Terraria

2018-03-28,0,0,1943,False,Recommended,My hours of playtime should more than likely speak for themselves but I feel as though with how much I love this game it deserves a review and recommendation. What can I say about Terraria? Regardless of how often I have played it I find myself coming back to this game time and time again drawn in by its charm and sense of adventure. Everything about this game from the catchy music and friendly characters to the sheer variety of creatures items and locations all there to help or hinder you is a treat. Each new world that is generated holds its own feeling of excitement as you dive into the unknown. Even though I have put so many hours into this game I still manage to find something new even recently. If you enjoy tense battles building cities or simply exploring a strange and dangerous wold I can not begin to recommend Terraria to you enough. The devs have added so much new content over the years that I would not even attempt to explain to you what is in store you will just have to see for yourself and discover the wonderful quirky ever changing world that is Terraria.,Terraria

Killing this final boss (Wall of flesh is its name btw) sets your world into ""Hard Mode"" which can spawn many MANY different ores for different kinds of weapons never before seen in normal mode. This game has hours upon hours of constant fun and exploration. Building is very well designed and easy to get used to. Fighting is extremely varied depending on what you fight with what weapon you fight with what armor you wear what buffs you get from drinking your potions and where you fight the enemies at. Combat feels natural and keeps a steady flow of increasing difficulty throughout your exploration. This is not a game you can ""Beat"" and always has something you have never explored before. Worlds can be massive filled with many different biomes both above and below the surface. Deep mines and dungeons are extremely fun and lets coop players have tons of fun.And don't even get me started on mods...",Terraria

2018-01-07,0,0,152,False,Recommended,Terraria is one of those games where you will die and die over again because you didn't realise how some enemy or mechanic worked. That is why it is so great. The game throws you into this crazy world of giant monsters and beasts giving you only 3 basic tool at first letting you with only the tinyest bit of help discover the rest of the game so that you have to play a lot to even get past the first boss. It can get repetative but with friends this game is fun fustrating and hard. It's wierd to think that you go from mining with a copper pick to kill cthulhu's cousin...,Terraria

2018-07-22,0,0,1165,False,Recommended,Best non japanese rpg I've ever played. Played this game on android first then on pc before 1.3. I've done a playthrough for every class. The game just keeps giving. Free updates 7+ years after release with no dlc. A thriving community. The best modding API for any game I've seen and it's not even made by the publishers. Used to run 80+ fps on max settings 4k but with recent visual and physic overhauls I just don't hit that anymore. The engine could really use an overhaul which I've heard is coming. 10/10 would skip hard mode ores again.(I have no worlds with hard mode ore fishing OP),Terraria

As you progress you unlock / discover more content events and encounters. Vast replayability. You can fight as melee ranged magic summons or any combination. Each world you create is different. You may never find that diving helmet or nazar you dream of but you may need an extra chest for your extensive Yo Yo collection.This game has only gotten better through the years. The many many updates have increased content functionality enjoyment and my OCD. I've spent over 1500 hours on this gem and enjoyed every minute of it. Alone or with friends (or strangers) it's beyond amazing.,Terraria
2014-09-20,0,0,751,False,Recommended,Terraria is a Sandbox Adventure RPG and an openworld game. it throws you in with a guide and several pieces of equipment to get you started. after several nights you will have a fairly desent house some fairly desent gear and some fairly desent NPC's around your establishment if you have made them houses. this world is filled with deadly creatures from the top of the world to the deaphs of hell. and hundreds of items to match your play style be you a wooden archer or a futuristic sniper there heaps of playthroughs for you.Although behind the amazing gear and creatures there is a down side if you choose to take it the Wiki. i found that once i went on the wiki all of the enjoyment in finding more gear was gone. i knew what to expect behind every chest and what i would get from every boss and i found that i stopped playing the game all together. just to sit in my steam account next to 200 other games. luckily after a year or so i returned and i had forgotten most of what the wiki taught me and i play the game once more.Don't make the same mistake I did only take the infomation the game gives you not what a web page gives you. 8/10,Terraria

2018-01-03,0,0,1212,False,Recommended,It's easy to write Terraria off as a 2D Minecraft clone but it's far from it. It's expansive it has depth and despite the hundreds of hours I've spent in this game I've barely scratched the surface of what this game has to offer. It's definitely a game that you can easily come back to time and time again. It's got a big community around it that has produced hoards of mods that expand this replayability even more and the community has created an extensive wiki to assist new players. I wholeheartedly recommend this game to anyone! Except people who hate spiders because jesus christ the spiders in this game are creepy as Update This is now my most played game. I have still never completed this game despite numerous playthroughs. I come back to this game time and time again and I will continue to do so even after I complete it.,Terraria
2015-01-31,0,0,1434,False,Recommended,This game has taken up a couple hundred hours of my life and in no way do I regret it. Terraria is an awesome game (and is in no way a Minecraft clone even though it took inspiration from Minecraft it is a unique and fun experience people who say Terraria is a Minecraft clone are people who never played it or played it for like 2 minutes) Terraria is worth the $10 ( or whatever price for whatever version)100/10 would pour hundreds of hours into this again(that is not a typo I really do mean 100/10),Terraria

I have played a recorded 55 hours not including the console version I have (Still a good buy but not as updated) and i am still not half done the game no im not slow there is just so much to do its incredible.Please buy this game if you are looking for a cheaper better version of Minecraft,Terraria
2016-01-17,0,0,401,False,Recommended,Terraria is quite the fun sandbox game and in my opinion has created a unique genre of games in the sense that while it's still a sandbox game it's inspired many other 2D sanbox games like it such as Starbound. In any case I love the fast paced action that tends to happen when you face a boss or event. I always love the serene way of how you can just relax and build or just sit down by a lake and fish. Terraria allows many different play styles. Some people are more laid back and tend to just enjoy the game slowly while other charge straight into the fray. All and all this game is very versatile in the sense of going at your own pace. Granted it certainly ranks up in difficulty once you enter hardmode but that's besides the point. I enjoy the constant adventures and finds. There is always something I've missed that I didn't notice before. It would take a lot more than 100 hours to truly explore just one single large map on this game.In the end Terraria is a grand example of the sandbox genre and I would recommend this to anyone looking for an action packed adventure that doesn't just toss you straight into it but more so let's you ease in.10/10 Pop tarts.,Terraria

Get wood build a house since mobs spawn at night then go and mine. But once you start to play after the basics it gets serious. Giant eyeballs Burning bats shadow armor Giant skeletons Magical items Wepons Corruption Hallow Giant worns. I can go on all day! The gameplay is so much longer compared to minecraft!

Go hardcore or make rules that make the game harder. Want a miscallenious world where you get a bunch of O.P stuff and have fun with it? Well go to a server and have fun with that stuff!

On top of this many achievements to complete I also have almost completed all of the current achievements. For now I'd reccommend this game to anyone barring a stupid change later on to PC edition.

2012-01-06,0,0,216,False,Recommended,The game has tons of content and by the sounds of it an impending Linux port. It's quite addicting and fun. There are various issues I do have with it though.The game goes to classic 1 armor 1 less damage route. This is a system that keeps items relevant in the early game as well as the end game. However because of this and the game's scaling early game items quickly become worthless. Pre hardmode items even of the highest tier feel rather low tier when hardmode hits. This can be a bit discouraging. While the game has added various superior versions of weapons it still promotes linear gameplay where you unlock the highest accessible weapons and makes all the work you did beforehand feel a little wasted.Despite all this the game is still a blast to play. Some people may think what I described as a flaw as a good thing to me if the former issue were addressed (more than likely in a sequel) it would be perfect.,Terraria

2018-06-29,0,0,22,False,Recommended,This is one of the games I thought that are not worth even trying to play.But once again I was wrong.I didn t spend a lot of time playing it but I can already see a lot of options how I can change the world around me and what to do there.The graphics are simple but I like them.And I like sounds and music either.Sometimes I got stuck with controls and how to command my avatar the way I want to but I think it is just because I m not used to it yet.I created a character and entered a randomly generated world. There's a day/night cycle and during night I was attacked by zombies and floating eyeballs.I played single player but there was one NPC with me and he helped me fight them.Suprisingly I was not afraid of those zombies because they were funny and kind of cute. ) So after this first night I immediately sarted to harvest copper wood and stone to build house and some gear and weapons.Then I went to explore the world which means that I digged deep to find iron caverns chests with loot and fought more bad guys.I constructed layered workstations to forge my harvest into better weapons and gear. I built more houses that attracted new NPCs who sold me exotic items or offered fresh haircuts.Once I thought I am invincible and uderestimated my enemy.And i was almost killed by pink slime. )Terraria is very much focused on combat than building. The dungeons presents new challenges and new enemies the lower I go.Sometimes the pure act of digging can get a little grindy but there is a lot to explore and I think that I am just on the peak of an iceberk.I hope this game will stay entertaining for a long time because I think it s worth spending my time playing it.,Terraria

2017-04-15,0,0,233,False,Recommended,This game is heavily popular for a very good reason. I've followed/played this game for a very long time and i can easily say it is a very fun game. The game offers plenty of challenge that is if you don't know what you're doing. The game has plenty of bosses some of which you need to fight to progress and some that you don't need to fight. The game has mounts allowing you to get around your world much faster. The game has an expert mode for those who a massively experinced when playing Terraria. I reccomend this game for the amount of content within this 2D Pixel Survival game. If it's your first time playing I reccomend you gather some friends and play together and take time. The grind to the end is much more fun that way! To add on the game isn't very expensive and especially with the content in account.Have fun playing this game! It's quite enjoyable.

2019-02-09,1,99,101,False,Recommended,"Were you a fan of the previous God Eater titles? If so you'll most likely like this entry even if you end up scratching your head at some of the changes.If you were never a fan this game most likely won't change your mind as it's still God Eater but with a lot more polish and better keyboard and mouse controls. Changes compared to God Eater 2 Rage Burst The Blast Gun has been removed. It has been replaced by the Ray Gun. Customized Bullets are limited use now but can be used on any gun. Burst Arts take the place of Blood Arts from GE2. There are other bonuses and mechanics to fit the AGE theme and aesthetic. The Bullet Editor has been rebalanced. Because this is not GE2 Blood Bullets are not a part of the game. Multiple weapons have been buffed up for better usability such as the Buster Blade and Variant Scythe. Aragami ""feeding"" has been changed. Aragami will now go to specific points on the map where 'feeding grounds' are located. Standing on top of a feeding ground while it is active replenishes HP and OP for your character as well. You can quick devour without leading with a normal attack now. The practice range is no longer restricted to bullet testing. You can now test melee weapons. Shield Charging is a new maneuver which closes gaps much faster than Steps. Verdict Without spoiling the story gameplay has received a lot of polish to the formula. The game is also considerably harder than Rage Burst was as everything in this game is sped up. For those who want to enjoy the story the story is there and it's easy to follow without prior knowledge of other God Eater titles though prior knowledge does help. As of this review the Online features are functioning with minimal latency issues. There's plenty of incentive to play Assault Missions as well which are online 'raid' missions.",GOD EATER 3
2019-02-13,0,0,87,False,Recommended,God Eater 3 is the latest entry in the high octane action hunting God Eater series the story setting in this game takes place some years after the events of GE2RB but instead you start off in a Fenrir branch based in Europe where they treat their God Eaters like prisoners forcing them to hunt down Aragami while killing off any that don't perform to their expectations.Gameplay in God Eater 3 is faster than it's ever been before adding new features such as burst arts that enhance aerial and ground combat and shield charges for chasing down fast Aragami or using it to dodge or set up for aerial combos. Three New weapons have been added to the game which include the Dual Wield God Arc which can be transformed into a Double Bladed weapon the Heavy moon axe which is a chakram type weapon that can be transform into a massive axe and the Ray gun that can shoot concentrated laser beams that increase in size and power as you maintain it in battle. The new Ash Aragami are pretty tough as well since they can chase you down and use devour attacks to transform in battle. Also the 8 player co op assault missions are also pretty fun and intense.The port was surprisingly good with almost no issues on my end very good performance even on my crappy gtx 960 build lol and controller support working pretty well too. Also another good thing to note is God Eater 3 will be getting FREE post launch content updates over time that includes new missions additional story more types of aragami new npc ai characters to join you additional fashion and cosmetics options quality of life changes new assault missions new gameplay modes such as time attack and more. God Eater 3 also includes Dual Audio so you can change the voices to Japanese if you want!Information on the Post game updates here https //www.siliconera.com/2019/02/04/post launch god eater 3 updates will make keith a party member add costumes and bring post game missions/,GOD EATER 3

2019-02-07,1,50,41,False,Recommended,Well having played for a bit now I am pleased to say being a fan of the other two God Eaters this one has not disappointed. Mouse and Keyboard works perfectly for me I've had no problems with either one. It has better graphics and runs perfectly.My computer doesn't meet all the minimum requirements but I've had no problems with it running smooth on high graphic settings. My graphics card is only a GTX 745 and the minimum suggested one is GTX 760. So there is something for those who meet the requirements but have problems. Your computer is the issue not the game.The camera is a bit sensitive though but you can make it a slower in settings. Even then it is still a little sensitive but not as bad. So just a little thing there for those who don't like the camera moving too fast.This is one of the best things They brought back the fast devour from the first one with the shift + right click. That was one of the main things I hated not having in the second one.Unfortunately they have the crappy upgrade system from the second one. Where you have to find materials before you know what you need to upgrade your God Arc. So that was a little disappointing but something I can live with.A good thing they brought in from the second one is the abandoned God Arcs to enhance your current ones. There are two new types of God Arcs specific to this one along with a new gun that replaces the blaster and the old favourites from the other two.They basically have blood arts though they are called something different. You even have a new team combat skill to use with your companions. I won't go into many details on that though you can play it to find out anyway. It unlocks early in the game. Better ones unlock later as well.The character customisation is great. I've checked both male and female customisation options and you can create cool and attractive characters. Most accessories from the other two are also in this one though there are some which aren't like the horns.To unlock new outfits you need to buy or find schematics. The same can be said about making new God Arcs guns and a few other things you unlock later. These you can get through the basic combat missions or buy from a merchant that is unlocked when you get further into the storyline.Like the other two games they still make your character feel special and unique with having a high resonance and being skilled in combat. The storyline is also interesting. I am always curious about what is going to happen next and what caused the 'Ash Storms' in this one after the other two.For first time players of the God Arc series though I would suggest playing the other two first. They have a whole tutorial to help with controls in this one but playing the other two will give you a good idea of how combat plays out. Plus introduce you to some great characters. One you actually meet again in this one.Added Bonus Your character actually has a past. You aren't just that unknown skilled rookie that becomes the heart of your party. You were with your port which is like a branch in the other two but smaller since you were a child. You even have a childhood friend and he is your groups leader. Mature and down to earth. Plus he looks nice so that's always good.They even have a Kota/Romeo combined character who becomes obsessed with that damn 'Bugarally' like Kota in the first one. Though that comes a bit later in the story.Fans of Shio may love this. There is a Shio like character guys. She is a lot cuter than Shio was and you get to spend more time with her. That in itself is a good enough reason to get the game and play through the story if you really adored lil Shio. That little cutie has stolen my heart.Oh something I forgot to mention. You can respond the way you want in certain situations. More so then in either of the other two. It makes you feel more in control of your own character and brings with it more immersion. Talking with everyone in between missions is also quite interesting. You have some fun convo's.All in all if you are a fan of the other two God Eater games I am sure you will enjoy this one. Though that is just my opinion on the matter. c P.s. I'm gonna say stop comparing this to Monster Hunter. It isn't the same only similar in some ways. Besides this game is way better then Monster Hunter as far as I am concerned.Latest Update So I finished it. It's a bit too short especially compared to the other two games. I dunno if anything extra is meant to happen when doing those other optional missions but I have no desire to grind through them. They'll be handy if I ever need to let off steam though. w Another downside. They didn't even explain how the Ash came to be same as when they didn't explain the Blood Rain from the second one. They were just there no explanation or anything.It was worth buying but neither the second or third games can even compare to the first game story wise.,GOD EATER 3

2019-02-11,1,25,47,False,Recommended,The game is simply amazing. It has taken the best of both GE2RB and GER and combined them while fixing several issues with the previous games. Examples of this is GER's quick devours GE2RB's Blood Arts now called Burst Arts and nerfing of the custom bullet system by removing the infinite supply (so get working bullet makers find me a bullet that will take out a target in one shot). They also added color changing for accessories which I love because now the extensions are actually useful on non blonde characters.You will see several reviews complaining about the Keyboard and Mouse being impossible to play with. This is completely false outside of the mouse acceleration (which isn't that bad it just takes getting used to) the controls are no different from GE2RB and GER. Do not trust the system requirements my specs are supposedly below minimum but it feels as smooth as butter on my PC on high settings. If you can run GE2RB you can probably run GE3 as outside of environment graphics nothing has changed majorly.Tthe game hits a major difficulty spike when you enter Rank 4 missions so I suggest a lot of practicing before you hit this point this way dodging and blocking become almost second nature. The new aragami do tend to have attacks that you cannot dodge so get used to using Shift+E more often than just E. There has also been an improvement on the bond break system as breaking bonds results in a visual effect that you can't miss so people like me who end up with the aragami morphing into a ball of screen effects will know when a bond break happens.,GOD EATER 3

2016-11-04,0,0,844,False,Recommended,I have played the civ series for a long time so my perspective comes with a heavy pro civ bias. I think this game reverse the dumbing down trend in mechanics by giving players more detailed control over their cities and empires. I love the new civics and religion mechanics and feel that almost every change in mechanics was for the better.That said diplomacy is practically a pointless mechanic and will be ignored 99% of the game unless major fixes come. The religious ui seems buggy or thrown in. The ai also is lacking any skill aside from yield bonuses. I hope this is improved or this game will not see the thousands of hours played that it's predecessors earned.In conclusion I still enjoy the game thoroughly but I worry for its longevity with these issues present. And longevity is civs bread and butter. The weak ai and diplomacy make this game feel a little isolated and more of a civ builder than a competitive civ game.,Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI

2017-08-04,0,0,497,False,Not Recommended,"Can't say i would recommend this game to anyone unless they got a serious Civ itch that needs scratching.Even then i would wait for the game to go on sale not to mention the ridiculously overpriced DLC that the game have. CIVILIZATIONS The Civ's are rather poorly balanced some are way stronger then others. Personaly i don't have a problem with it since i only play it solo. If you are into the multiplayer part it might be something to keep in mind.The personalities that comes with each Civ is rather frustrating i can see what they went for by giving them agends of things they like/dislike but in the end it just turns out the AI hate you no matter what. Trying to get friendly relations with other civs is almost impossible with the AI's agendas stupidly high warmonger penalties (that apply whatever you started a war or not). RELIGION Religion is one thing i could have done without in this game. I just hate the way it is implemented. The investment you have to make to found a religion and spread it isn't really worth it as the religions tend to be rather lackluster and having to fend off an endless stream of rival religious units is just a headache to deal with. MAPS/WORLD BUILDER I also find the maps rather underwhelming not so many to pick from and they tend to be rather dull. One can always hope they add more and better map scripts eventually. Other map related issues is that you tend to spawn really close to other players. It usually ends with a super early war and an AI player knocked out as a because of it. The lack of a proper worldbuilder isn't helping either. You can access one with some modifications but it's super buggy unstable and not very good. The fact that you more or less have to use mods to be able to use the maps you painstakingly created doesn't really make it worth it. CITY MANAGEMENT At first i loved the districts but now i rather hate it. In order to get good adjacency bonuses you have to micromanage the placement of them and it's is only fun that many times. It can get frustrating to plan out things so you don't block future placements and to plan ahead for districts not yet researched.The fact that you can't remove districts kinda sucks so if you missclick when you are about to place your district or wonder... well you are stuck with it for the rest of the game. Not to mention when you conquer cities with bad district placements. I don't mind that wonders take a hex slot around the city since it's a unique building. Tho it can be a bit frustrating that some wonders have really specific placement requirements.Maybe i'm old fashioned but i miss the old city management screens. This new one is bad just like the rest of the UI. UNITS/COMBAT Not much to say really i like the new worker charges and combat isn't that different from Civ V.Some of the unit promotions are a bit lackluster and super situational. Despite the talk/hype about cities taking up more then one square (districts) you pretty much still only fight over the city center. Well sometimes you have to take down the military district. BARBARIANS Well what can i say. The barbarians are actually a legit threat now. I have come to rather like the new barbarian mechanic where they spawn scouts to look for cities that once located (and the scout returns to the camp) they will start to spawn units to attack you with. Some people hate it and i can understand them. But you can always turn it off if you wish. The thing Civ VI really needs is More map types More rule options when making a game (plz i want to turn off religion p ) Better UI seriously.. it's super bad. DLC that is actually worth the asking price. Improvements to the Diplomacy. Seriously would be nice to have a game where every Civ didn't hate you even when you don't wage any wars. The Civics cards needs a little work? Alot of them are so weak that i never use them.. If it weren't for the mods that ""fix"" some of the issues with the game i would probably have tried to get a refund long ago. But as it stands there are mods that fix some of the gamebreakers for me so now it's a game i take out for a spin every now and then when i get the urge to play a Civ game.oh btw i LOVE the building the greatwall of china.

2016-10-29,0,0,295,False,Not Recommended,The more you play it the more you realize that there's little going on behind the pretty facade and new additions compared to Civ V. The AI just can't play this game anywhere near the level required for a fun challenge the only way it'll win is by churning out units and bumrushing your capital in the first thirty or so turns aided by huge starting &amp production bonuses on medium and higher difficulties. After that initial bumrush unless you basically stop playing the game yourself the AI will just shuffle around units offer you silly trade deals and literally hate you for playing the game.And then there's the patching strategy even if you ignore that basic quality of life functionality (restart button build queue decent trade overview etc.) wasn't in the game on launch and it took them months to add modding support the fact remains that they only push out updates every few months when they have new DLC (basically stuff that modders make for free) to sell. New bugs that are introduced (game breaking or not and there's a lot of them) don't get addressed until the next time they want your cash.From what it looks like this game was rushed out by the publisher and left with a small skeleton crew to churn out DLC and the absolute minimum of bugfixes. The official forums are dead (one or two posts a day) recent reviews on Steam are basically putting it at a 5/10 and for all we know the current broken state will remain until they announce an expansion to trick people into giving the game and this publisher another shot.And yes I know I played almost 300 hours by now I loved the Civ franchise and I really wanted to discover ways to play this game in a way that's challenging and fun but most of my playing time was spent wondering where the fun I knew from earlier Civ iterations went.,Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI

2016-10-20,0,0,44,False,Recommended,Great game. Just one outsanding problem that I truly cannot believe has not ever been addressed in the previous games or this one. It is incredibly annoying that if you tell a unit (such as a scout) to move into a tile that is in the fog of war and a unit happens to be there that you couldn't see before (such as a barbarian or player you are at war with) your unit automatically attacks that unit. If your unit is a scout this usually results in its death. This is incredibly annoying. It forces you to have to inch your unit along one tile at a time to make sure you don't accidently attack something you can't see. This is especially annoying in online matches when you are trying to play quickly. If you move a unit into a fog of war tile and there is an enemy unit there the game should simply stop your unit 1 tile before so that you can quickly decide if you still want to move into that tile and attack that enemy unit that you can now see.

2017-10-09,93,3135,4258,False,Not Recommended,"tl dr Just play Civ V instead.Well I've been trying to love this game for 642 hours now (as opposed to 3532 hours wasted/enjoyed in Civ V). Some observations about this game as it stands alone now that the adjustment period from Civ V is out of the way AI's military tactics are still extremely weak. It does not assemble its units for advantage attack when it has the advantage or defend its cities effectively. You'd think a fundamental goal for any game like this would be to have fronts naturally develop as in a real life war. Nope. Scattered random skirmishes that the AI always loses. You can run the map with 1 2 infantry or cavalry units plus 1 artillery. Diplomacy mechanics bring nothing to the game. If you so much as defend yourself or retaliate against an aggressor as one does in war you're branded a warmonger. Were the Allies warmongers in WWII for conquering Germany? Leaders relentlessly spam you with their disapproval consuming ridiculous numbers of UI animation seconds before you can esc/cancel with each one. Despite claims that leaders approve of certain things it seems to be an either/or all or nothing hair trigger mechanism. A leader will love you one turn and denounce you the next because they expected you to have one more military unit that turn or something. There is no nuance spectrum or ""scoring"" to this system as far as I can tell contrary to the claim that there are several levels between ""friendly"" and ""denounced."" It's a waste of effort to try to get along with everyone while trying to win a science or cultural victory. Just let them inevitably declare war and fight them off. Firaxis has figured out how to make leader interactions annoy you further and waste even more of your time. Clearly you want to be spammed with an inconsequential 30 second message for ""good job"" ""or ""I hate you"" several times each turn often interrupting your next click and wait an additional several seconds for it to respond to multiple Esc presses. The AI engine is SLOW. I've played on an i7 5930k and an i7 6850k and on both it takes up to a minute to process AI turns in late game. I think most hours spent playing this game are for the ""please wait"" stage. Why Firaxis cannot take advantage of parallel processing or cache possible scenarios in advance while you're taking your turn I do not know. There should at least be an option (or default) where other player moves have faster animations so that you can see what's happening without losing time without making all the animations bizarrely short like in quick combat. The lack of automated builders brings more tedium to the game than it does craftsmanship. In late game I really no longer care about the details of each city there are no real mistakes to be made and I do not want to micromanage every single tile of every single city on a standard to huge map. Keeping the charge mechanic on builders but adding an option to automate (or making it a technology like a ""self reliance"" civic) would probably still encourage early game caretaking while removing late game tedium. The game in general just feels slow and tedious. This is in no small part due to terrain penalties and weak road bonuses for unit movement. (And the fact you essentially can't deliberately construct roads military engineer roads are too expensive.) Even in the middle ages no it didn't take 20 years for a unit to cross a civilization. It takes a lot of the oomph and fun out of army mobilization when it's far more practical to move single powerful units against the weak AI than to assemble melee and archer units into a tactically appropriate formation. There's simply no reason to bother with a combined arms / blitzkrieg approach in this game. I like the districts mechanic in principle but it's not flexible enough. Districts should be removable at a cost or at the VERY least there should be more information displayed in early game about the future optimal options for each tile. It's really not fun to try to wing it and guess where it will be best to place an industrial commercial or theater district in the future before you can select those districts to see the adjacency bonuses. (Or for placing future wonders each of which have strict arbitrary requirements.) At the very least there should be some sort of filter (a lens?) to display all adjacency bonuses on a tile. Tile info popovers are slow and unreliable. Just show the dang info when I mouse over. I'm not afraid. At least make it so that mousing over a resource icon by accident doesn't prevent tile info from displaying until I leave the tile and reenter. Personally I think the air unit mechanics in this game feel awkward and unnatural. Why not just emulate real life instead? Carriers in real life can project power farther and to more places at once than allowed by the 2 short range aircraft as can air bases. Jet fighters intercept attacks like in Civ V. They don't sit there and take it. No cruise missiles or ballistic conventional weapons in this game? They do exist in real life... Also by the time you can build aerodromes and project significant air power you could far more easily have created 3 times as many land units of greater power. The air game seems to be rather pointless and is placed too late in the game in terms of military advancement. Air units are too weak for the time they take to acquire. Minor note you'd also think cheap surveillance or attack drones would be making an appearance by now. Nuclear weapons are thankfully a little more realistic in this game since they really ruin whatever land you'd like to conquer but at the same time you've got to ask of what use are they in the game? The AI never has a powerful enough conventional army where you'd need nukes to defend yourself. Since you can conquer all other civs with 3 army units it's foolish to nuke them first and ruin your takings. Best guess if you're trying to win a science or cultural victory you'd like to ruin everyone else's day? If you're in the mood to go for one of those victories initiating nuclear war doesn't really fit the bill. In my experience all games devolve into domination matches. As soon as someone attacks you (inevitable) you will have an army and be branded a warmonger for defending yourself. So you might as well remove the nuisance of neighboring civs who like to attack you. Nature then takes its course. Maybe this is a bit realistic but it doesn't exactly meet the 4x varied experience Firaxis is trying to accomplish. City state and liberation mechanics are flawed. There is no real way to defend an allied city state or even just to play peacekeeper. You're not notified that they are attacked and you are not given any casus belli for declaring war. War of liberation (after the fact) also doesn't seem to become available when it should. If you do liberate a city all your units are immediately expelled from that territory bizarrely and unnaturally disrupting your advance in a way that just wouldn't happen in real life. Takes the fun out of liberating that neighboring continent that had been conquered by a single civ liberating France as in WWII is literally impossible. So tired of hearing ""best not to aid that city state"" from other leaders. What are you talking about? I didn't aid any city state. Which one??? The tech/civic boost mechanic is neat but it makes games far too uneven. Either I hit all the boosts by the luck of the map and launch a moon landing or accidentally win a culture victory in 1700 or I'm tied up in a war for 500 years (in which I can't go on the offensive to end it or else become a warmonger) miss a lot of the boosts and discover petroleum in 1960.I fired up this game this morning on a sick day to pass the time and found that it's more fun to write this review than to sit through any more hours with the game. That should tell you something.",Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI

2017-01-01,1,1,21,False,Not Recommended,I will be comparing this to past Civilization games.Lets Start off with how the game runs. The graphics are tuned down and given a more artistic style rather than the realistic style that Civilization V had. I get a Civlization Revolution feel when playing this game. With the dumbed down graphics the game runs smoother. The turns and movements run really seemlessly and its hard to even tell when it's your turn. That being said the game suffers from random crashes. Everytime I start a game an online game my friend crashes at least once due to a different problem each time. I even felt the wrath of crashing before I wrote this review. All this being said the game starts up quicker than past civ games but still rapes your ears with extremely loud music. If you can deal with the occasional crashes and the simpler art style then Civilization VI is your game.Next lets talk about the Content in the game. Civilization VI has 18 civilizations in total with the Aztecs being a preorder civ but available after the 90 day launch for free to play. Now to compare this to Civilization V after all its dlc was released there was 43 civs. Now obviously we can't compare an at launch game to a game that has gone through many dlcs and game updates. I expect Civilization VI to have th same amount of Civs after all its dlc has been released or maybe even more. 18 Civs is a good number and offers a wide variety of replayability since every civ plays differently. Whether you want to go to the conquest route that Germany offers you or the Cultural route France offers you every single one of your play styles is there.What did they add? So a lot of things have changed from past civ games. Civilization VI now has 2 trees to go down a Science and a Culture tree. With the addition of the Culture tree you know can specifically select which play style you want rather than rushing Science in order to get a cultural victory like in past Civ games. Tech such as Civil Service is now in the cultural tree. It now makes more sense. Another thing that was added was Amnenities and Housing. Amnenities has now replaced Happiness and works the same way. If your Amnitity is too low your production will slow down and your population can revolt. It seems though it's not as big of a concern as happiness was in Civilization V. Many a times did I have revolutions on my hand because my happiness was too low. There is also housing. Housing can affect how your population grows. If you don't have enough housing your population will slow to a halt and will not expand. Near mid game housing tends not be an issue due to the new Housing District which I will now talk about. One of the coolest things that has been added that was not in previous civ games is Districts. Districts can be built in a city and take the place of one tile and allow you to build specific buildlings. A Campus (Science) allows you to build universities and libraries. It also allows you to use a Great Scientist on it. Almost each resourse has a district. There is one for Housing Amenities Science Culture Gold Military and even production. The districts allow your city to look more diverse and be beautiful rather than the lands just be farms. Lastly I just want to talk about the AI. This is the thing that really drove me to make this review. The AI suck... They almost always hate you and will turn on you in a second. Civilizations have 2 traits that a player can try to appeal to and it determines whether or not they like you. I will use Rome as an example. Rome has 2 traits one is a set trait that he will alwyas have and one is a random trait. The set trait is Rome likes civlizations that expand. The unkown can be anything. It is the most difficult thing to appeal to more than one Civ because their traits all vary largely. There was a time that I become friends with a civ and then they denounced me the next turn. The AI are very unstable and Ghandi is stil a warmongering If you want a guarenteed win in Civilization VI go down the Militaristic path beacuse you will go to war with atleast 6 nations whether you are friendly or not. After reading all of this you're probably wondering if I recommend you buy it. Yes. I do recommend you pick this game up...when it's a cheaper price. The game isn't the $60 price tag for the issues it has. Maybe if the price goes down or they fix the issues that are present will I then recommend you go out and buy it now. But if you have Civilization V just stick with playing it.,Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI
2017-06-21,0,0,1110,False,Recommended,I like many other reviewers have played all versions of civ and a huge fan. I was not disappointed by Civ VI. Likes City building is by far the best it has ever been requiring the most planning ahead of any game. Exploring and the rest of the game play is fun like all the rest. Barbarians are evil. I like this Some wonders are very powerful and require well planned cities.Dislikes (minor) AI is very predictable if you don't have an army everyone will randomly declare war on you around turn 100. But walls 1 2 range units are often all you need to beat their attack. If you beat their first wave you can just walk over an knock down their cities. The DLC is overpriced but i did buy it and i do like Australia. so you know i did buy it... it did cost as much as a coffee... so i skipped coffee that day.

2016-11-02,0,0,86,False,Not Recommended,"So I've be playing all the civilization games since the first and was really looking forward to this latest installation in the series. Unfortunately this game is unfinished to the point where it's just not enjoyable. There are a lot of good things and good ideas but I'll just list what I think has be changed to make this a worthwhile game.1. AIThe main reason why the game is not enjoyable is the AI. Or rather the lack of it. And in a single player strategy game AI is everything. Some people complain about the diplomatic part of it (why did it declare war on me) but the big problem is on the unit tactical scale. It seems almost as if there is no tactical AI or coordination at all but instead the units just move one by one not really caring what the other units in the army does. The effect is comical and breaks the game. The AI will embark the army without protection of a navy and just wander around as cannonfodder. It will wander around cities without attacking because god knows why. It will get stuck in chokepoints and attack you with just one unit at a time. The missionaries will wander around in hordes of 10 or more because they all do the same calculation of which city to convert next. Etc. Etc. Basically the AI is at the level of a football team with 7 year olds where they all just run for the ball. The solution at the higher difficulties is to give ridiculous bonuses so that the AI can build neverending masses of 7 year olds but wheres the fun in that? You would be insulted if someone suggested that your football team should play a bunch of 7 year olds and you should be insulted by this.2. UIThe user interface feels unfinished and is lacking crucial features. There is for example no strategic list of all your units to get an overview where is the good old F3 screen? Or the F2 screen? And why can't I zoom out more? I pretty much always play at maximum zoom out because I can only fit like three cities in the window even then. And the part of the map that's been discovered but not visible is all virtually the same color good luck telling plains from desert. The mouse over time to get the tooltips on terrain etc. are ridiculously long. When people declare war there are no longer little icons so you can immediately see who declared on who. No they are bunched together so you have to view them one by one. Combine that with the mouse over time and combine again with a bug that forces you to redo the mouse over once you read a declaration and you've got yourself a nightmare. (You can fix this by pressing shift but that's not mentioned anywhere and why would I even have to press it to begin with)3. Cultural and religious victories...are just boring. Cultural is basically a competition of who can amass the most culture and tourism points. Religious is a competition of who can amass the most faith (and spam missionaries with it). It's too simple. At least add some more features like using faith and cultural influence to control enemy units or stage revolts and take cities or do espionage. Just something to make it feel like I can actually do something actively with my influence more than just add point after point.4. BuildersI always automated workers once my empire grew in the old games because micro managing them was boring. In civ 6 there is no automation of builders so you have to spend way to much of your precious game time building farms and mines. 5. CivilopediaIs lacking so much information that you need. There are not even any back and forward buttons. I find myself tabbing out and looking up stuff on the internet instead.6. Build times versus research timesFor me this has been an issue in many civ games but in civ 6 more than ever the build times are way too long compared to the research times. You may find yourself with AT infantry before you've even built your first crossbowman. The idea of the new heureka system is great but you'll never have time to actively pursue the boosts as you are steaming through the tech tree. 7. The tech treeLike I said the heureka system is great but sometimes the links are weird like building privateers to get boost for electricity or power plant to get ballistics? More of a problem is that there are much fewer links now so you can for example get to infantry without knowing about stuff like rifling or gunpowder. I mean come on.8. All the bugsThere also still quite a few bugs in the game. Every few hours the game just crashes and exits for no reason. The ""Last built"" text that you get in a city that just finished production is always wrong. I liberated a city state and now it's called ""City state name"" instead of Hong Kong. The list goes on.What the game doesn't necessarily need at this moment is more units and civilizations. Unfortunately that's what's going to come because that's how you sell DLC's I guess.(I know a bunch of these can be fixed by modding but my point is that I shouldn't have to resort to that)",Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI
2016-12-15,0,0,494,False,Recommended,Civilization 6 is a masterpiece of systems. You think you hate it coming over from Civilization 5 but if you just let go of your preconceptions and expectations you'll find a great game.Pros + Many systems interacting together in interesting ways (e.g. Great People Housing Cities Amentities Eurekas City State bonuses/quests etc).+ Performs significantly better than Civ5 turn to turn.+ Civilizations/Leaders have more unique abilities/traits/buildings/etc.+ With the introduction of Eurekas and Increased requirement to build city projects the Science victory is not (always) a tedious wait machine.+ With the changes to the movement system having a scout actually feels necessary.+ Barbarians present a challenge if left unchecked/ignored but are easily dealt with (usually) once you learn how to deal with them (kill the scout).+ Civilizations seem less geared for a specific victory and more capable of taking on multiple victory conditions (usually).Cons UI is on the opposite side of Civ 5. The previously mentioned systems that make the game great also make the game more complex (but still not EU4 level complex at least). Religious bonuses feel very weak and in turn religion feels very weak. And therefore civilizations who have religious focused traits feel like they have worthless aspects to their traits (but don't necessarily feel worthless themselves). AI is still stupid.,Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI

2018-07-30,98,853,1883,False,Not Recommended,"After putting in about 1500 hours at the time of writing this I think it's safe to say I can write a somehwat informed review (because I have opinions and I like to share them that's why). I'm no veteran Civ player I've only played 5 and 6 though I'm aware that 3 and 4 are still good games. However even coming from 5 which had it's own disappointing launch 6 is a massive drop in depth and quality. No matter how hard I try I cannot lose myself in this game the way I did in 5. I'm never on edge wondering what will happen next because I know what'll happen next. War. War for settling wrong. War for being the wrong religion. War for governing wrong. War for being too strong and too week (at the same time). War for not trading. War for simply existing in a manner that doesn't quite suit somebody else. What seems to be an attempt to inject some personality to diplomacy with ""agendas"" results in predictable games where everyone hates you or everyone loves you (until they don't). There's never a middle ground.On agendas certain civs simply don't play themselves as they should. Hey Brazil I see you've denounced literally everyone on Earth for making more great people than you. Would you like to change that? Maybe build a campus or theater square? No? Just gonna build another encampment? Thought so. Nice to meet you China. No I didn't realize you were the preemminent builder of wonders in the world. Do you know why? It's because you never built one China that's why. Ah Cleopatra I see you're now chronically indecisive as you simultaneously hate and love large militaries and simply can't make your mind up. These agendas will override everything else you do with/to another civ. If you are friends with America and watch helpless as the Aztecs burn and pillage their way across the continent you might be inclined to pitch in on good ol' America's behalf. But more fool you because you see America hates people who declare war on his neighbours even if those neighbours are currently enslaving his own people and turning his cities to ash. A man's got to have a code after all. Now you're a warmonger. Why? Good question but it's ok Alexander the Great still loves you.The next part of my rant jamboree is the design of the game such as unit scaling and modelling and such. Before the game was launched there were many people who expressed concern over a ""mobile game"" aesthetic justly concerned that 2K might be trying to grant their next installment with some more mass appeal at the expense of anyone being able to take this seriously. Thankfully the gameplay hasn't been dumbed down so much as screwed up (see agendas). I am not terrified of this army of strangely proportioned stretch armstrong figures marching towards me because I'm too distracted by the trader whose cart is 2 or 3 times taller than my palace. In Civ 5 when the Mongol horde was at my borders it stretched on and on like well a horde. Now it appears to be maybe 20 horses all together each being roughly the size of an entire building and altogether looking rather silly. If course there's another reason not to be intimidated by the Mongol horde or anyone else's horde for that matter. The entire combined forces of all other AI civs could be beaten back with a damp rag and a can do attitude.The AI in Civ 6 cannot war which is particularly damning in a game that always ends in a war. Alexander the Great of Macedon may command the most fearsome force known to man but rest assured it'll be soundly defeated by simply doing the following ranged units + garrion promotion place in city centres and encampments. Or just wait them out when you think the enemy has gained the advantage they'll just sit there and contemplate life or throw themselves away on fortified units with ranged support. It's worth pointing out that at launch the AI did not even know how to use boats or planes so I wouldn't hold your breath or anyone elses for any of this to change any time soon.I will now try to think of some nice things to say about Civ 6. You can use mods in multiplayer games fairly easily. See that overpowered civ from your favorite TV show that was obviously made by a fan with no thought to game balance? Yup you can bring that into a game with your friends and make them regret basking in your presence. The most fun I've managed to have in this game has been with friends where the only real competition in science culture faith and of course war are the other human players. The AI might aswell be so many other city states. Oh and the music. While I miss wartime music (listening to the cheerful Kongo theme while nuclear hellfire engulfs the planet is a bit jarring) the whole idea of music evolving with eras is just fantastic. Entering the industrial era to ""Scotland the Brave"" blaring in your ears while you agressively bagpipe the inferior nations of the world into submission is satisfying to say the least. But then you realize that you're building the same cities all over the map and that the last game you tried to get into was the same as this one and that enemy you've been contending with isn't really contending so much as falling behind because he decided to give up on winning. And then everyone denounces you for being close to winning yourself. And then I get tired of this and try and get Civ 5 to work again with a bagillion mods.(oh yeah and districts aren't that special I always end up building the same 2 or 3 different cities with no variation)(I'll stop typing now I am very tired)EDIT I have so many hours played in this game because of friends who used to enjoy playing it. As they lost interest I lost interest. There were other mods I used that also made it fun which are no longer usable since the summer patch (I think it might have been the spring one I can't remember). I cannot reccomend this game because it does not stand up on it's own as a civ game should. Time and time again the modding community has found and fixed bugs that should have been dealt with before release. Maybe the next big dlc will make Civ6 a game worthy of the franchise I don't know. Until such a time I do not think anyone should buy this game. That is my opinion and I am entitled to it no matter how many hours I have played or whether or not I ""got my money's worth"".(While I understand where some people are coming from with the ""you played a bunch but didn't like it so why did you play it"" mentality I would not take any review seriously with few hours played regardless of wether they reccomended it or not. If my friends came with the game in a sort of package deal then sure I'd reccomend it but I got them elsewhere)",Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI

2016-11-24,0,0,561,False,Recommended,Base game only 164.6 hours at time of review.If you really loved Civ 5 you'll probably love Civ 6. With the last few Civ games they have been somewhat lacking upon release only becoming complete when all of the DLC is released. Civ 6 feels pretty well polished at release though there are some problems. The AI needs to be tweaked it feels seemingly random some of the decisions the AI makes. Diplomacy is a shambles though it has improved a little in the fall patch. There is a lack of playable civ's compared to the post DLC number of civ's in Civ 5. If you didn't pre order you don't get the Aztec civ which is a really bad move by the developers/publishers. One can only hope they release the Aztecs for free later on down the line. This is all sounding a bit negative but as with the last few games the game has gotten a lot better and more complete with DLC so I have great hope the flaws will get fixed. That said I really like Civ 6 even now.It has another great soundtrack. The art style I was a bit dubious about from watching the trailers but it looks and feels great.Gameplay wise I've played 164 hours in about 3 4 weeks. The unique units/buildings for the different civ's are great you could say they could use a bit more balancing but I disagree. Germany has amazing industrial capacity Greece has really good cultural buffs Russia has good religeon buffs. It all depends on what style of victory you want to aim for. Even so some civs feel a bit too powerful at times.Overall I give this 8/10. If you love Civ I highly recommend you pick up the digital deluxe version and you will get the soundtrack and the next few DLC will be free.,Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI

The only reason I have for not reccomending it is admittedly a pretty shallow one (especially for a 4X title) but one that has left me currently unable to enjoy the game...The art style.It is im my opinion horrific. It's farily obvious that the style is evocative of Clash of Clans et al and an attempt to tap into the popularity of these games to attract a new demographic of potential players (and to make mobile and console ports much easier and quicker). The rights or wrongs of this approach are an interesting area of debate however from my own point of view it leaves a game that in its current visual state I have no interest in playing.I am fully aware that I have not played nearly enough of the game to comment on its mechanics or improvements and equally aware that criticising a game only because of its visuals is considered unfair in the extreme.

(Luckily mods can change this).Cons AI when you learn to play well you will end up at war with rest of the world in first 50 100 turns ) AI makes a lot of dumb moves like settling near you or moving troops near you but penalizes you for same moves (so let it be War!),Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI
2016-10-26,0,0,961,False,Recommended,"Product received for free. I hate reading big blocks of text so I'm not gonna waste your time by belaboring any specific point. The AI is very badI don't care how many catapults and knights you have you're not competing with my modern armors. The AI seems to be bad at upgrading their units among many other things. (Perhaps there needs to be a change in how overall army strength is calculated.)Expanded diplomacy is goodThe AI is better about letting you know how they feel about you why and when these changes take place. Being able to flat out ignore requests is nice compared to being forced to respond. ""Hey move your troops"" ""I'm going to pretend I never got that message"" One thing the AI was good at was dencouncing me for constantly ignoring their demands to move my troops.Eureka/inspirations are very goodThey give constantly keep you engaged by giving you objectives to speed things along. They encourage you to explore many of the game's features.Expanded spying is very goodPeeking as someone's city screen and taking their techs was nice but stealing great works and money recruiting rebels sabotaging production and more? Not only that but expanded promotions for spies? COUNT ME IN!!!Interchangeable social policies is very goodOne thing I disliked in Civ V was that your early choice of starting social policies had super long lasting effects and you sometimes had to adpot them before you were certain about how you wanted to play. The ability to switch out policies gives you flexibility letting you respond to the events of the game.Information era needs expansionNo death robots? Seriously?No progress notifications for culture victoriesI beat a friend in a multiplayer game because he didn't see my culture victory sneak up on the world. There are notifications for science victory steps and captured capitals but no indication of culture victory progress unless you check the menu yourself.I'm recommending this game because it's pretty darn fun despite the flaws and I hope these issues get fixed.

2016-10-27,0,0,575,False,Recommended,"My friends and I consider Civ V to be something of a modern classic. The game was just close to perfect and we were waiting for Civ VI for the series to truly come into perfection or at least come closer to it. The results are mixed. The graphics and the UI have been improved for example. Religion and culture are now easier to digest because of it. More importantly new mechanics like districts and agendas have been added to add complexity to the game and these new features mostly succeed. Civ VI is familiar but fresh an interesting new iteration to a franchise with trademark mechanics. But certain flaws have been amplified as well. The AI are all delusional psychopaths. Winning in singleplayer at Prince difficulty is an absolute joke. Usually a nearby civ will declare war on you when he or she is clearly unprepared and will then dubious tactics in fighting you. You will more or less inevitably win their cities and the rest of the game will be too easy to bother with. Diplomacy is also very limited. You cannot take out loans for example an action which is basic in real life diplomacy between state actors and has the potential to make things very interesting. The diplomacy has also now become very opaque. They are trying to make interactions with AI more realistic but they have only succeeded in making diplomacy with psycopaths somehow harder than it already is. The fact that the AI is terrible makes any kind of interaction with them ridiculous in nature and trying to approach them rationally is a waste of time. It is better to ignore them or harass them at your advantage. Trying to gain their favor is nearly useless especially when they're so bad that you can take them over at any time.However the story is very different in terms of diplomacy with city states. It has been streamlined and a screen pops up whenever you can send envoys (which you use instead of money to influence city states) so you don't have to go up and down the map looking for them. Several improvements like this along with innovations such as the civics tree keep this offering from being completely a waste. You have a separate ""technology tree"" that deals with policies which are cards that you can use to give several kinds of benefits. These cards are put in slots. The number of slots for military economic and diplomatic cards (as well as a wildcard slot) depend on the type of government you lead and the types of government are also unlocked through the civ tree. I thought this addition along with the districts is the most compelling and the best evidence that the series has advanced. Civs can now be more tailor made to your playstyle and preferences as well as according to your current needs.Several annoyances have made it here as well. Reports your spies and merchants make block the screen when you start your turn and there is no way to remove them manually. You have to wait for them to disappear. There's an excessive lag between when you read a message from another civ and the appearance of the button to exit. Unit scrolling is literally the worst thing ever. God forbid someone try to join your multiplayer game because you will have a bad time.Civ VI is certainly not a ""triumph."" Not yet. I am hopeful for the future through updates and DLCs. For now this is a solid foundation and a nice and interesting game. And one more thing Teddy Roosevelt did not have such a whiny voice.",Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI

2016-10-21,0,0,22,False,Recommended,I have played this game for 5 hours nonstop now so here's my two cents. The game is really good in comparison to some of the other civilization installments. Beyond Earth for example doesn't even compare to this. The new mechanics are really pleasing. Now when you want to build something you have to build the specific district which will have a list of building options. This is in contrast to the earlier civilization games where you could just build your buildings. Districts also take up space so you need to manage the land a little bit more. The biggest difference in this game is for me is the technology. Now there are Eurekas in the game that speed up your research. So what do you have to do to get these Eurekas you ask? Well... You have to complete the specific task prior to or during researching the specific technology. For people like me who try to build science buildings to rush a science victory it really makes them have to allocate resources differently. I was behind in science in my game even when focusing on science only because I didn't do the Eureka boosts. Overall very good game and with a few dlcs and mods it will be a masterpiece.,Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI

2016-11-02,0,0,36,False,Recommended,Great game really enjoying playing this version. Districts add a new level of depth and strategy as you cant just build every thing you want. The same with wonders you have to prioritse what your city needs.There is lots of complaints about the AI and i do agree to some extent that it needs slight improvement as the AI does not attack or defend well. Hopefully this will be fixed.The new restrictions on growth through housing and amenities as recieved alot of stick but i think this is a great feature because again it brings a new level of strategy to your city planning utilising every tile to its maximum potential to ensure steady growth.Builders now only have 3 improvements before disappearing again brings another level of strategy.The AI seems more aggressive in the early and mid game which again seems to be taking alot of stick however this is more a true representation of what it took to build a great civilization at that point of time. Wars where always inevitable and if you go into the lead on this game the AI is coming after you.The negatives for me are the fog of war which is very bland AI needs fine tuning to help make them a greater threat.Overall 9/10 This game is great for civ veterans but for newcomers its gonna be a steep learning curve cant wait too see what they do with dlc's in the future,Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI

You can't learn the new game mechanics before some assload of barbarians come ing up your life and to boot your borders mean all to barbarians there is no early city defense that you can use so tough if you are an expansionist or wanted to explore the map you are going to constantly be spending early game resources on ing barbarians. 1.)

2016-11-26,0,0,210,False,Recommended,Over all I think Civ 6 is a nice addition to the franchise. I am a huge fan of the districts and eureka moments they make the over game play feel more meaningful and requiring more thought than previous installations where you end up doing the same thing repeatedly. Initially I was taken aback by the new artwork more cartoon like and bright vivid colors. In the end I m pretty happy with the choice and really enjoy how the terrain mixes and forms a developed landscape as the game goes on. The city states are a little more beneficial compared to civ V and worth keeping around even if they can t seem to take their military out of the stoneage. There are however some issues with the game. Over all it seems easier than Civ 5. This might be in part because of the AI. As many people have mentioned the AI is rather sluggish in later era s with its military often fielding units from several eras prior. The AI also seems to be very lazy with improving its territory leaving several lucrative bonus resources unimproved late into the game. The AI also can t seem to handle the district bonuses very well building districts in poor locations when there are far superior locations within the city limits. These issues might make the game seem easier than Civ V since it benefits the player who can plan long term handsomely. Overall I still enjoy playing the game and hopefully they can get the AI working more efficiently with the new game mechanics introduced.,Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI

2016-11-19,0,0,250,False,Recommended,I have played Civ from version I to the present so I start as a fan. Every new version has annoyed me a little because it changed the game. Having said that with 2k hours on Civ V it seems the changes are something I get used to then adapt to over time then come to enjoy. Civ VI is no different for me. Is this your old Civ V game with updated graphics? No it is a complete redo of the overall game engine in many ways. It is truly fun though. Great gaphics new ways to accomplish things and overall a good time. I like the fact it is different because I can still go back to Civ V when I want. Winning via domination is harder but do able. War is downplayed a bit in this version and I do miss the giant death robots what can I say. Culture seems a bit easier to win and science I have not achieved. I like to make my own religion B.A.M brothers from another mother that is pretty cool. My first victory was cultural even though I was just a few cities away from domination. Another area I really enjoy is new natural wonders. I have looked up many of the locations I have found and learned some new beatiful places I would like to visit some day. Kudos for the geography lesson. What needs to be fixed is the AI. The denouncing you for no reason gets very annoying. Begging for the riduculous trades is a pain. At this point the game still need a little tweaking in that area alone. but is still very very fun and I will work to go through all the achievments as I have done with Civ V. Honestly though who cares I am not trying to be their buddy I am going for world domination. No matter what you do your going to make them mad because they figure your winning. Even in Civ V the whole blue jeans denouncment comes from a peaceful cultural victory. In Civ V you got denounced for spreading religion as well so I don't find it to be all that big of a deal. I am not here to make buddies but do be the most dominate civilization so yes I am going to break some eggs and they are going to be moody.,Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI

2017-06-17,2,1,220,False,Recommended,"Consider this a luke warm recommendation with strong cautions. If you enjoy battling it out down to the last min/maxed resource against a capable AI this game is not for you. Why? Because the AI is sloppy and clueless. If you enjoy developing an empire building your cities calculating the risks and rewards of build and expansionn strategies and having neighbors that get in your way and wage futile war against you you'll enjoy this game. Why? Because city building requires attention districts adjacencies terrain perks amenities and city state systems all work well. But and it's a doosy there's no diplomacy to speak of in the game so you're better with Europa Universalis if that's your thing. There are some really fabulous annoyances in Civ 6 that mean you have to have patience with developers who ignore important QoL things. Prime example? The ""create game"" option doesn't remember your settings. Which means if you have a highly ideal set of parameters and you're looking for a good start be prepared to input those settings over and over again. Otherwise create game will give you a completely vanilla set up. The AI is really clueless. Example. You have just discovered aluminum. Every single Civ that has anything to trade you will ask you to give it this rare resource. That's okay on the face of it. But if you are leading the tech race they will still ask you for it even if they are an age or two behind you and can't build a single unit with it and wouldn't be able to withiin the 30 turns it is available to them since resources do not stockpile. Then there's the dreaded warmongering penalty. The warmongering penalty is a hideous mind game the devs put into the game to torture you. What is this penalty? Having every single civ pop up frequently and lay hate on you. Imagine a game repeatedly telling you ""I hate hate hate you!"" That's Civ 6. There is no way to avoid this penalty except not playing the game. As a consequence of the warmongering penalty diplomacy is futile. There's no point in trading with civs gifting them stuff they need being nice to them in any way or forming alliances with them. There is literally no diplomacy at all in the game worth engaging in. The vaunted ""hidden agenda"" of a civ is just that they have a sneaky way of being able to denounce you and pop up routinely to hate you. Civs will turn against you on a dime declare war and remain angry for an extended time and there is no cure for that. And just so we're clear about how useless diplomacy is in the game there is no diplomatic victory condition. But you say being an experienced 4x gamer there must be a penalty against your civ to this warmongering penalty? Hahaha. No. There isn't. Except the aforementioned hate torture. If you don't mind it (and can't escape it anyway) you can gleefully wage war against the AI and predictably win. They aren't going to like you no matter what you do. There's also the religious scrum. When the AI sends a gazillion religious units against you flooding your tiles relentlessly. This is extremely annoying. You can get a good laugh out of it though by turning off Religious Victory. As you can see there are some strong reasons to not buy this game particularly if you are an experienced 4Xer who enjoys diplomacy or an able AI contest. But if you're just interested in spending a good many hours exploring building and expanding then Civ 6 will fit the bill. It's a pleasant game with enough intricate systems to grasp to be enjoyable for a number of games.

2017-06-11,0,0,302,False,Recommended,"Hey guys! I've been scrolling through the reviews lately and have found a mixed amount of comments which argue about the pros and cons of Civ VI. Be warned though! The following are my thoughts and my thoughts alone in regards to the Civ series after playing many multiplayer and single player games. Also not going to mention expansions because they don't bother me. Like what kind of expansion do you want? I am almost tempted to say that the base game has everything I need... Oooooo actually I wish for the choice of doing colony management!! Like how if I'm settling too far and they become sick of me they can ask for independence!! Perhaps even enslavement of people from other civs ) Sorry that's just my wish not actually part of the review ) MwahahahaBack on track now.I've played both Civ V and Civ VI for a while now and have loved it for as long as I remember playing games. Civ V was the first game that I ever bought and played with my money. I loved it but also hated it. Civ V became too dull predictable and repetitive extremely quickly. Although I say this I'm still one of the people who always wish for one more turn. Civ V had a problem where it involved a lot of wonder spamming and the civs that build the first few wonders tend to be the ones that manage to push on quickly enough to win the game. Civ V beginning strategies involve finding a place next to the river mountain and probably a coast. Then it proceeds to build a monument and locking your production on food. This happened every game and it doesn't matter which civ you choose as long as you follow this path. It made it especially frustrating during multiplayer games where everyone is following the same strategy. Multiplayer aside the world congress mechanic was broken. In single player veteran players would simply have to buy out the city states and voila the world is essentially yours. In multiplayer this mechanic works slightly better. However you can easily get destroyed the moment someone like Venice/Greece decides to buy out all the city states and have complete control over world religion and world ideology. This can be devastating for your civ and I've had friends who would fight over a game either due to the wonder spree jealousy or world congress mechanics.When I first played Civ VI I had my doubts. The graphics looked different and weird. The way culture science and so one worked completely differently. I like how you can gain extra science and culture through discovery and completing specific projects rather than just beelining for the specific techs which you know will give you an advantage even though it's completely useless in your scenario (Such as getting advances in boat tech because you live on the coast.) It was better than Civ V where you discover how to sail even though there's no water on the map and city states would like the great lighthouse too. With time I developed a real liking and respect for the game. With the new district system the Civ game allowed me to plan how to build my empire how to specialise and at times how to make money... Gold can sometimes be a big pain in the bum... As you play the game you even learn a lot about real life civilizations and society where everything is interconnected to a certain extent and you can't have one without another. You learn how to work with the AI and not be a pain in the bum. These simple changes to me made the game feel much more balanced unpredictable and different each time both in single player and especially in multiplayer. Housing and Amenities VS Global happiness and No Growth Limit. Mmmm this is a fascinating one. I felt that global happiness sucked... I hated it... Global happiness is too uncontrollable/manageable/reasonable/predictable/(Not)understandable. You can have two cities with luxury resources and all happiness buildings and still be unhappy... WHY!?!? Housing and Amenities in Civ VI were VERY tough to enjoy at the very beginning but it did become easier to enjoy and love in the end because it was understandable and manageable. Next!!! The AI system can be improved as many people have stated already. AI in Civ VI especially at higher difficulties would occasionally forward settle you and be angry whenever you try to settle another city. This of course has annoyed me for quite a bit throughout many games. However I do remember the same happening in Civ V. People say that the Civ VI AI is unpredictable and chaotic in comparison to the Civ V AI which is predictable to a certain extent... Where's the challenge if I can just predict the AI anyway?? Civ VI AI is more chaotic and sporadic but once you understand the mechanics of the AIs having two individual agendas they become easy to comprehend and just be a good friend (Not being an and sending troops near their borders. Civ V AI in general has a lot less to do in comparison to the Civ VI AI. One has to hate the world and anyone who settles near him/her and the other has some hidden variables which you can exploit and see results in time. All in all the developers can DEFINITELY improve on the AI which we have to be mindful is a challenging project. I've studied programming before and understand that building an AI isn't just saying ""Is he cool? Yes? Cool friends. Did he just shoot me? War please )"" Finally! Nah I'm done. Feel free to comment on my first review ever XD. I hope this helps you. Like I said before I used to be the biggest Civ V lover but it's safe to say that I've converted over to Civ VI. There's a lot to love about both games but I felt that Civ VI is more balanced and advanced both in single and multiplayer. I know there are definitely players out there who have played the series longer than I have and have a different understanding from me. These are what I felt when I played in single and multiplayer of both games. I feel that if you are on the fence about this game watch some games on youtube and perhaps ask to play on your friend's copy for a bit. Reviews are useful but in the end you know what you like only after you try it. I'm much happier with Civ VI than V and these reviews wouldn't have helped me make my decision. P.s. If you developers are reading this my ideas about colonies and enslavement isn't a must ') I actually had this interest because I played a game called Stellaris and thought that Civ would become an extremely interesting game with this mechanic. I've followed your Civ VI development from beginning to now and keep up the good work! I love the game!",Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI

2016-11-25,0,0,233,False,Recommended,"As it currently stands CiVI is a game with well crafted gameplay mechanics numerous minor bugs / brainfarts and an AI that disappoints.Absolutely loved the way the game handles its economical side this is a definite upgrade from what I experienced with CiV the civic government and amenity housing systems keep the decisionmaking surprisingly fresh all the way to the end. Great persons tailored to different timings and victory conditions are an interesting twist which adds to the game planning in a good way. Stacking more than 1 military unit to corps / armies work fine although the increased military strength from stacking feels currently a bit weak the major reason to do it at the moment is upkeep cost.The AI left me with a half disgusted feeling with ""why you do dis"". You know that feeling when the only positive modifier ally with no other friends in the game turn insane and backstab me with classical era units vs tanks just because I'm about to snatch a science victory or when Roosevelt first agrees to pay me for a joint war and then nags me about declaring wars on his continent or when they talk their personal agenda related things that just feel.. unrealistic. Why would England suddenly tell me I tread dangerous waters with their colonies when they a) have 0 colonies and b) we have had 0 interaction except sending a trader and opening borders. Also why the f*** does Rome still declare holy wars to me for converting all his cities over thousand years ago? I don't think modern day Iran declares holy wars because someone converted them from majority Zoroastrianism over 10 generations ago.I guess the way AI remembers history or plays to win and not to preserve itself is not an actual issue if you consider CiVI as a board game with permanent players rather than leaders that evolve along with the history of the world. To me this is disappointing.I did not even start to speak about the way AI manages wars. The unit management is a tough part for even human players to optimize but the AI seems to be utterly incapable of conquering cities vs civs that should be overran in terms of pure military strength. In one out of 6 games did I see an AI actually overrun another and never did they manage to grab a city from me if I had even a minor defensive army around. Also a valid offensive strategy for human players vs AI is to declare a war from defensive positions and wait for the AI to waste all its units against your fortresses.After trying out all different victory types on Emperor difficulty racking in 90hrs of gameplay I can say that I won't be returning back to the game until the AI or diplomacy is improved or the SDK released.Nevertheless the game deserves a 4/5 grade for its gameplay mechanics alone. Worth the money and fun but the lack of meaningful AI starts to hurt after a while. Also a plethora of minor annoyance things (such as traderoute and spy micromanagement) could drop the rating to 3/5 if you're feeling unforgiving.",Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI

2017-01-06,0,0,127,False,Recommended,I recommend any game that make me play 20+ hours and so I ofc recommend Civ 6. One major improvement is how it handle mods they are easily imported and activated by default and it seems to be easier to make stable mods in Civ 6 than Civ 5. However there are flaws there are several ways to victory one that defeated me in my first game on the easiest difficult lvl on the smallest map vs one opponent Egypt was religious victory. Before I had even made a swordsman I was suddenly swarmed by missionaries and lost becuse the Egypt religion became dominating. So be careful with open borders...But the BIG flaw I really saw when it comes to war I did see when I had AI only game with all starter Civs (no Aztecs) on the biggest World map out there. Starting Age Renassaince true starting locations domination victory only. I followed it from 1500 to year 1750 before I got to bed. Greece was a dominating force in Europe Egypt and Kongo split Africa with Spain in one corner. Brasil was better at expanding than USA China and India all nations with plenty of room to expand and barbarians to fight. So when I checked the game again it was 1932 and to my... annoyance? there seemed to have been very little progress. More citys had been added but no borders had been moved because of war and it was not because of lack of war the AI is simply incompetent of doing sustained war at the moment it seems even the smallest nations were still around. And first I thought the science had been screwed up because there were a lot of units around but the land units were mostly crossbowman and muskeeters and the sea units were frigattes. But looking around I found units like infantery and ironclads but they were few indeed. A Civ 5 game would never have turned out like this and I think it comes down to how ranged attack has been nerfed and that stacking is back because what I saw was these old units stacked in armies with 3 musketeers forming a unit that could go to toe with far progressed single units. And upgrading armies are costly because you need money to upgrade three units at once so the AI doesn t bother. In Civ 1 4 games you had artillery and bombers to deal with stack of units because such attack could weaken several units in the stack at once that isn t the case here because it count as one big unit.Put this togheter and you have a pretty stale war game there science progress isn t nearly as important as it was in Civ 5. Production is the King and religion is much more important now.,Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI
2016-11-23,0,0,13,False,Recommended,If you enjoyed Civilization V you will enjoy this game although you should expect quite a bit of a learning curve for the first few plays. This is because the game's mechanics are significantly altered compared Civ V to the point that they may be outright confusing if you go in expecting this to just be the same old game. Having said that there is so much to love because of all the changes that make the game so much more fun and challenging from start to finish.The only downside was the AI being a bit simple and a whole bunch of minor annoyances like the inability to name cities and UI issues but the latest update is a hefty one and fixes pretty much all of these even shakes those up AI behaviour issues.

2016-12-26,0,0,283,False,Recommended,"Although one of the strongest base Civ games I've played (playing since IV) there are many downright silly omissions. The biggest for me is the lack of a ""restart"" button to reroll for map generation you have to manually input ALL setting over again from the main menu if you don't like your start location. The result is you spending 30 60 minutes just trying to get a decent map. Further there are fewer map options than Civ 5 like the mostly Artic mostly Desert or other more niche maps are gone. The interface takes some getting used to compared to Civ 5 and barbs definitely need tweaking as they're overpowered but overall a good game.

2016-11-25,0,0,292,False,Recommended,"Civilization IV 6 is more than 5.++ Culture has been revamped its now retooled into a branching tree much like science. Advancing in culture means unlocking new government types policies and certain wonders and buildings its a big improvement over the way culture is handled in 5.++ The new districts system allows you build towards the way you want to play with a bunch of positioning and adjacency bonuses. If you do a little planning ahead you can get some very optimized outputs. Its an improvement. ++ The way wonders are handled is arguably alot fairer now. You have to give up a tile per wonder built so you can't just stack wonders all into a single city like you could in prior games (you can still do it but you're probably going to have to plan growth a bit more carefully)++ The city states system is a total improvement no longer will you have to keep throwing gold at them just so they'll like you.+ There's a day/night cycle which you can enable in the options menu which is very easy on the eyes.+ Each AI civ has particular likes Trajan of Rome likes expansive empires that fight barbarians Harald Hardrata of Norway likes civs who have a strong navy and high cultural output etc. This allows you to make naturally aligned alliances with other civs (Or know how exactly to antagonize or provoke a war with other civs.) You can make national parks in the later half of the game a four tile area of un improved land that creates tourism and provides amenities. (They replaced ""happiness"" with ""amenities"".)

I have no problems with graphics of a game who are rather pleasent to eye I especialy like how fog of war is done in style of old sea maps. Really is sad thing that this game had so much thumbs down and I really cant understand why. Main change in this Civilization it that one that you dont build cities in one hex but now you build districts so you cities expand and some new buildings are build in specific districts (militiary academy is built in solider district) and plus some districts can have bonuses depending where they are placed and also some had to be posinitoned on proper position (aquadact has to be placed near water source)Al in all this game really is one of best edition in Civilization franchise and I am only sad that I see lot of die hard fans of franchise giving it thumbs down from all wrong reasons.Plus we all forget on all new players who never played civ game before I do find this game is really great welcoming game for new comers to the franchise too.,Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI
2017-06-15,0,0,71,False,Recommended,Let's look at the most talked about topics of the game ContentIs Civ 6 more fleshed out than Civ 5? No. Of course not. Do you remember how long it took for Civ 5 to actually become good? But does that mean it's bare bones? Far from it. This feels like a Civ that's already had expansions added to it. Something that I think needs to be said is this When Civ 5 released I didn't enjoy it at all. I went back to Civ 4 almost immediately. Now that Civ 6 is released I honestly can't go back to Civ 5. The improvements to the city building system midgame pace and simple but effective art style have drawn me in and I can't go back now.Short answer The features &amp improvements Civ 6 provides outshine it's faults.AIIs the AI bad? Mostly. Basically what it comes down to is that there's this new thing called agendas. Every civilization has 2. One that is constant for that particular civ and one that randomizes each game. The idea is good it helps to portray not only the character of the leaders but give them a goal/playstyle. But it's what most people are currently complaining about because the execution is faulty. Fine Cleopatra likes civilizations with large armies and dislikes civilizations with no armies but let's say theoretically you don't have an army and she currently hates your guts. The next turn you somehow manage to create let's say 6 military units... She will begin to worship the ground you walk on. The system manages to instead of giving these leaders personality give them a multiple personality disorder. As amusing as it is in the beginning it becomes exhausting trying to keep up with who hates and who loves you turn by turn. Short answer The AI is bearable needs a rework.User InterfaceNot much I can say here all this really comes down to is personal preference. Civ 6 is a lot more complex than Civ 5 and so it makes sense that they simplified the design and art style of the UI to make things easier to interpret and understand at a glance. I personally do like it.The PricingOh boy. As much as I love the out of this game the price is honestly ridiculous. The fact that I bought this after playing through the demo twice on seperate accounts should be an indication of how much I really enjoy it. But honestly Firaxis please lower your prices. The game is wonderful and that's why I'm not giving it a downvote this review is based solely on the gameplay and not on the price. Is it worth the current price? No I don't think so.

2017-07-31,0,0,432,False,Recommended,So I really love this game. Its so addictive and it gets a thumbs up from me!However I've seen so many negative posts and reviews about this game. So many of which are unfair. Yes on release the AI wasn't great but it has improved and is continuously being tuned. The support by Firaxis is superb and they continue to listen to suggestions and the civ community.Some of the balancing done since release has improved the game a lot and made the gameplay much more fun. Every game is different you never know what mix of map placement and civs will provide you with challenges in each game.So I do get frustrated when people say the game is broken or unplayable which in my mind is pure garbage. the game works well the UI is superb and its a greatly polished game.That's not to say some negative posts do have good points. for example the DLCs provided are expensive for what they are and although the Civs they add are very good they do charge to much. But you dont have to buy them. And yes sometimes the AI some stupid things but its a game I just play it for what it is.Now whether you enjoy the game is personal preference and also Whether you can adapt from civ5 (which took me a while!) in fact i played the game like civ5 when it came out which is totally wrong and i stopped playing for a while. Whether you understand the new game mechanics and how they all join together to make this wonderful thing of beauty. Again it took me some time to learn them there is a steep learning curve to this game it took me 50hrs of game play just to understand the basics plus numerous you tube videos but once it clicked and i got it ive never looked back and the game is actually quite complicated in the way its systems all interconnect and affect one another.Overall I really enjoy the game now and I can't put it down. I did enjoy civ5 but no where near as much as this one.

Now typically if i invest 10 hours into a game that means i got my enjoyment from it i got 6 times that and will probaly triple my current game time like i have with Civ 5 4 3 and 2. Now this game does have faults but considering the fact that this game has everything Civ 5 has after Vannila and 2 DLCs minus the civs plus extras id say its worth the money. Pros Pretty graphics i love how its stylized and i love the classic map style. Has an improved diplomacy system so now i can declare war on those ers that keep converting my cities are not get as bad of a warmonger statues. About time. 2 tech trees one for culture and one for science which i think is a good feature. Districts i believe make the game feel more alive making your empire a little more interesting also making it more important to protect your borders. Governments are kinda 50/50 for me. I like how you can choose a government type through out the ages and choose your own policies to customize your government to your needs. Though the policies feel underwhelming with only a few being truly useful. Cons AI is ing stupid below difficulty 5. You need to play at 5 or higher to get a real challenge. You will blow them away in tech and culture if you play in 4 or below. Not only will you be much more advanced but they will constantly demand things from you even though they have no leverage against you. Policies feel underwhelming AI is war happy. A story about the AI is that Norway declared war on me (Difficulty 5) invaded my civ destroyed my districts. I destroy his army push him back to his nearest city i take his city as payment he begs for peace i accept it and keep his city. 10 turns later he denounces me calling me a warmonger. What the ? A story about the AI from a friend is that Teddy asked him if he would join him a joint war against England since they settled on their continent. He accepts they go to war and then the next turn Teddy declares war on him because Teddy hates it when other civs declare war on civs on the same continent as him. Lol what? Conclusion.Basically my cons are to do with the AI which most issues are solved with playing on 5 or above which any higher and the AI cheats like in all civ games. So far i love the game and find it as an improvement. It has tons of potential and i am excited to see the DLCs.,Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI

AI does not act in a realistic way at all.No multiplayer teams.Mod workshop still missing 3 months after release.

2018-03-02,0,0,245,False,Not Recommended,The more I think about it and the more analysis of Civ 6 I read the less I am liking this game. In large part because they've made a game where war is always the right answer. Everything you can do in the game you can do quicker and easier through war. Civ 6 isn't about building a civilization to stand the test of time it's about building a machine to cynically crush everyone around you. Civs can't meaningfully interact in any way besides war. There's no point in maintaining friends or alliances since the buffs they give you are minor compared to what you could get through conquest and the lack of penalty for conquest or growing across the map like a cancer means that defeating literally the entire world is objectively the best way to play. Despite some of their buffs and agendas the AI knows this and can t get a grip on international cooperation as war will help it accomplish all its goals quicker and easier.If this is a simulation of human civilization then clearly war is the only meaningful thing humans do it is the culmination of our evolution. I wonder what Carl Sagan would say about that? This makes the idea of cooperation between nations merely cynical exploitation. Since every civ always views itself in competition with everyone else there is no real trust or friendship despite minor differences each Civ is playing the same game with the same attitude. There is no actual variation in beliefs or cultures you will always be an imperialist in Civ the AI will always hate you and always be an imperialist towards you. Also no one seems to have told the devs that the nation state model of society is only applicable from the 16th century onwards and really not until the 18th century tbh. This is compared to a game like Stellaris where the complex ethics and government systems mean you can have truly diverse nations which have actual meaningful relationships have different goals and different play styles. While not without its own shortcomings at least Stellaris makes you feel like nations in the universe are unique and interact with you in different ways and the war is not always the answer.Civ 6's AI is incredibly bad. I've tried to appreciate it but there's no more lying to myself the AI can't play this game or understand its rules. The fact that each AI has an agenda breaks the by design the AI won't react to realities on the map but rather around what it is pre programmed to love. Not that it matters because it's trivial to deal with. In 245 hours played I've never been defeated or seriously threatened by the AI. Increasing the difficulty only makes the AI cheat more aggressively further breaking the game. I'm also really starting to dislike Civ 6's digital board game approach to video games. It isn't trying to use a computer to simulate a planet and society it s just a board game. For example to manage your government you literally shuffle cards. To a degree all Civ games have been board games but in this iteration the developers specifically draw attention to this. Rather than abstracting the variances of life through simulation the abstractions are based in board game design. This isn't surprising considering the lead developer was a board game designer rather than a video game designer. Through its UI and heaps of flavor text Stellaris manages to feel like your managing a living empire rather than playing Complex Catan.And Civ 6's user interface is.And the tech &amp culture quotes are unbelievably bad. Sean Bean did a great job with the trash he was had to read. For the first 245 hours I sunk into Civ 6 I enjoyed the game for what it was trying to be despite how fundamentally broken it is. When I evaluate the game based on what I think a Civ game should be Civ 6 might actually be one of the worst entries in the series. I'm going to shelf it for a while and play Stellaris as well as revisit Civ 5.Districts are cool though.,Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI

2016-11-13,0,0,0,False,Recommended,Beutiful interface and smooth gameplay. Problem is no matter what victory condition you select you always end up stuck with religious war. That or you let the missionaries suck you dry. Clearly religion has a big role here but it is being leveraged under every victory condition and all civilizations perhaps too much no matter your setup choice. It becomes tiresome after a while and takes out the longer term replayability factor.The other thing is that all civilizations react pretty much the same. You get a couple of diplomacy moves and then you end up with religious war again. Perhaps the AI needs to be refined? That is not to say this is not a good game but the classic choices that marked the series from the start are not there any more and that has probably alienated some of the players who were there at the very beginning.,Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI

Last Civ I played was 5 long time ago with all DLCs it was fun. I checked only single player content for that it was great. Coming up Civ 6 is price'y but... it simply gives alot in that package. Many fractions many things to test I have 18 hours and I didn't finish any game from start to end because I am still learning things. How to be efficient in that game. I play on King difficulty I play multi with a friend and we simply have fun. Game is well explained and probably the most friendly 4X series on Steam. I wouldn't recommend it for only singleplayer purpose... it is rather boring comparing to civ 5 scenarios.Soo anyway I paid a good money for Civ 6. I am happy from what I've got. Day and night system is gorgeous along with graphics and music. City districts are fun and give our country a nice individual look. This game feels diffrent with each fraction as a result it is fun for at least 100 hours. But only if you have time for at least 2 hour sessions.

(civil engineers design district not the city state. 4 AI clearly cheat. builds like 4 warriors and building in like 10 turns BS5 civil research and civil outlay is not realistic. 6 barbarians are cheating and unrealistic in AI behavior &amp grouping. barbarians from more than one camp send units to my cities and coordinate attack. all barbarians rebels etc under one flag. even total war droped that since Rome 1. really? dude make the game realistic PLS.7 maps sucks. no earth and fog of war is a bummer. i prefered the shadows over no map intel 8 no roads really as if civilisations like rome monglian empire or german autobahn or even the great British empires maritine routes didnt affect civs historicaly. and bs trade system much like Civ 6 trade routes have nothing to do with resources but with gold culture and science really? didnt great britian manipulate india and china with opium spices silk and tea? resources are exchanged through diplomacy really!9 great people are generated faster but are extremely limited one great act and usually tied to thier respective districts for me that is pathetic. i have to build culture districts just to get rid of writer musician and painters. three great people for one district! big balancing issue. stick with 6 much better7 is by far the worse civ i have played and i know sid colonization that came out for IMB 486 in the 90s,Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI
2018-02-11,0,0,13,False,Not Recommended,I see folks regularly whining that the AI is too warlike. However I am finding the AI is just as docile as in V. THE PROBLEM is that the AI is NOT WARLIKE ENOUGH!I dont get it. I played a game on a small map for about 70 120 turns. I got to late Classical my nearest neighbor to early medieval. I even encroached on my nearest neighbor's turf and he responded with a warning. In the end he offered me deals to exchange a luxury for open borders and a little bit of gold then traded with me. The other nearest AI player was expanding with territories and had a large army of 4 7 units. That player sniffed around my borders early on made no aggressive moves then attacked barbs instead pretty far off and out of the way.I will admit I did have a ton of resources and was rich compared to everyone else with my nearest neighbor having 50 gold compared to my 400. But I had barely any army units just one roaming warrior and archers guarding my handful of walled cities. My closest neighbor had some better improvements and at lesat his capital was a little better than my best city. The second closest neighbor had at least double my army.I forget the exact difficulty I played on but it was the one in the middle. Before folks comment I do not want to hike it up which also gives teh AI lots of buffs. I want an aggressive AI THEN i'll increase the difficulty till it's a nice challenge but not stupid hard.I will not be getting this game exactly due to it not being exciting enough lacking war focus. I will not be getting the next civ unless there is an option to make the AI aggressive again like there was in 4.,Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI

2016-12-27,0,0,150,False,Recommended,"""As our protests are in vain we hereby declare war""Civ 6 is for the most part a very fun game it is more engaging than previous Civilization Games its unique blend of realism and cartoonism is done extremely well and the district system is one of the most welcoming additions to the game. The game encourages a much more aggressive player you can't just hide away in your fort of solitude but instead must explore the world.My main two gripes with this game are war and production. Production feels like it just takes too long I wouldn't mind if there was a slight decrease to the production time of everything in the different game speeds. Although what I think is more of a problem is war the AI in this game is remarkably aggressive and stupid I haven't had a single instance where just one AI declares war on me it's always two in addition it's extremely frequent. I have been declared war because I've gone against an AI's Secret Agenda the problem is I can never find out what that Agenda is since they keep declaring war on me. I don't think Agendas should provoke war instead they should just stop friendship it shouldn't be unless the player is overtly aggressive that war should be declared. Also I suspect France is to blame for this.",Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI
2016-10-22,0,0,1157,False,Recommended,"Have you noticed that most people that have given this game a bad review have very few hours on it?Civ VI isn't a game you get down in the first playthrough. I quit the first three games because I was getting overwhelmed even on the easiest mode! The thing about this game that Civ V and the others don't have is a good layering of how you can be attacked pretty much right from the start and unlike Civ V every AI is batsh*t crazy so you aren't being singled out by AI every game. That said this is also far more fast paced in several ways than Civ 5 so if you don't get everything about the game be prepared ot be disappointed your first few playthroughs.Things I liked The AI is crazy but not stupid. You really have to watch your back on this one DISTRICTS! Set down a bowl then put in some fruit. Districts are that easy but it helps you form what kind of city you want to build. In Civ V you pretty much felt obligated to put in every building just becuase it was there to build. Now you can specialize. You have to earn trust and that trust has levels. I've never had anyone on friendly terms with me yet (my fault entirely) but when I do I know I'll have some awesome insider info because they have little secrets they won't tell anyone they aren't bffs with. NO WAITNG TO MAKE CITIES! Civ V the first 1000 turns Must wait with two cities until all city counted wonders are completed...Civ VI ""Ain t nobody got time for that!"" Build like mad they'll accomodate. I hated the game the first 10 hours or so of play but now I love the heck out of it. I figured out how to do religious wars against other religions without actually going to war and they actually throw lightning at each other as they fight! Sweet stuff! And while I was learning this and beating Rome to bits for sneak attacking me after offering friendship and open borders Spain and England were using their spies to syphon off a good hunk of my gold. Is the game worth $60? Meh not yet. Will you be sad you spent it on this compared to the other games on here? Doubtful.

You have to think of the trade off between creating a district or keeping the improvements around your city. Combat feels fresh with a good upgrade system experience and unit combining mechanics. The graphical style is awesome and although I don't spend a load of time using it the strategic view is beautiful.If I pointed out a few faults there are a few day 1 bugs and issues the notification system is not amazing too small and dismisses inconsistently. AI still does some weird things especially with its religious units. The government choices allow a lot of freedom but like the aforementioned builders / districts can feel a little micromanagey.All said a super strong entry into the franchise with lots of great things.

2017-04-07,0,0,14,False,Not Recommended,If you dream of micromanaging a civilization then Civ VI is for you! Be nagged about lack of housing and ammenities have surprise wars declared on you for attracting more great people and watch another civ win a religious victory before you've gotten out of the BC era all while on Settler difficulty!Jokes aside Civilization VI took everything good about V and threw it out the window. Sean Bean narrating cannot possibly make up for the fact that even on Settler it is rather difficult to beat the AI especially considering the AI will declare surprise wars on you constantly. Building city districts around the city center is an interesting concept though it does deter you from building near bonus resources as putting a district or wonder on it takes away the resource. They also made builders have a set number of improvements before they disappear (default was 3 improvements when I played). As mentioned above wonders are also built on tiles outside the city center. Research is separated into science and civil trees with science being technology based (obviously) and civil being used for such things as drama &amp poetry and foreign policy. I really wanted to like this game as I spent many hours playing Civ V but I just couldn't. Though the changes I listed were good or at least tolerable the fact that I lost my first game to a cultural victory before the 1700s because in a cultural victory you only need tourists not influence made me rather unhappy. The next loss was to a religious victory because you only need to have your religion in half of each oppenent civ's cities to win. After turning those two off I had a surprise war declared on me over the next 3 games with no hopes of defending myself due to lack of funds to buy or maintain military units.TLDR version This game is fine if you are fond of micromanaging housing and amenities and don't mind losing a lot but if you just want a fun Civilization game to kill hours on just stick with V.,Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI

Much more new additions including researching civics and traders who run a continuous string of trade routes creating roads between cities. I only have a couple of small complaints like that it's a little inconvenient to have to create more and more builders because their actions are limited but that adds to the dynamic of the game. Also I'm a little disappointed that they haven't fixed the fact that when you declare war on someone early in the game your warmonger penalty lasts literally for like 1000 years!

2017-08-22,2,1,205,False,Recommended,I only started playing an entry into the Civilization franchise a couple months ago when I picked up Civ 4 on disc from a local charity shop so judge my review knowing that. Yet in those few months Civilization has easily become my favourite and most beloved game series I have ever had the pleasure of playing I was obsessed with destroying other Civlizations spreading my religion throughout the world and building that extra wonder so it would get me a little closer to a cultural victory. I then moved on to Civilization V and I have to admit I was rather disapointed a fair few features I had loved from the previous entry had been removed aswell as the overall presentation of the game being clunky and seemingly unfinished. So as I bought the latest entry into the series Civ 6 I was hoping that it would return to the more simplier fun and in my opinion more flexable Civ 4.And after having a long singleplayer session in the game. Aswell as being half way through a multiplayer session I can saftely say I believe Civ 6 has captured me in a way that Civ 4 did all those months ago That isn't to say I dont have my problems with it though. I'll start of with my issues with the game as I always like to end on a high after reading through some of the other reviews here it seems most people agree that they find the art style far inferior to the art styles of previous entries and although I believe it does have some redeeming factors I have to agree that I overall prefer the more realistic art style of the entries that came before. Like I said though I do like some aspects of it one of my biggest and only problems with Civ 4 was that I sometimes struggled to read some text as the background art style is somewhat dark and gritty. Luckily though this art style takes on a much more bright and vibrant look aswell as being more soothing and pleasing on the eyes therefore I had no to very little trouble at reading the text on screen. Next I want to talk about the leader screens what I considered one of my main reedeeming factors of Civ 5 is the leader screens which I found very alive and said a lot about the nation in just one short animation. That aspect has been seemingly lost in this entry the leaders are certainly very 3D and look more real and active in Civ 6 but unfortunatily I found myself unable to learn anything about a certain leaders personality beyond a small line of text telling me that they had denouced me within 5 turns of meeting them. The backgrounds of the leaders are very stiff and are usually very similiar to one another unlike in Civ 5 when they all had they own look style and feel that really showed what kind of person you were talking to. My thrid complaint strays away from the art style and instead is an issue with the game mechanics itself. The fact is the AI is still severly broken even after a couple updates that promised to fix the issue. The AI do seem to like to declare suprise wars on you i'm fine with that but what i'm not fine with is there units incircling your cities for 5 turns without actually attacking i've heard from a few people that this problem has been since fixed but this has problem has confronted me recently so if they did try to fix it they clearly didn't do a good enough job. This is rather game breaking in a way as if it occurs it means that you are easily in a position to fight of there invasion and i've found after a couple turns they simply get bored and leave. And my final problem with the game as it is now is having to pay to recieve certain Civ's. I've already payed 50 for the game which I think is more than enough for a game of this size so I find having to pay extra for something that I don't think is outragous to include for 50 is unacceptable in my eyes.Alright my rant is now over so i'll start to list the things I like about the game for which there is many. First of all the general presentation of the screen is much improved when compared to earlier entries Civ 5 in particular the layout no longer seems cluttered untidy and generally inconvient to use but everthing has it's own place various important information regarding your nation is never more than one click away and even at the start of the game where I hadn't watched or played any tutorial as I though I may be able to pick the game up with my experiance of Civ games in the past when I was looking for a certain option or something that would tell me a certain something it never took more than 30 seconds at most to find it. I know just earlier I was complaining about the AI but that doesn't mean it's all bad I found throughout the game the AI would make deals that weren't ludicrous like the deals that i'd sometimes see coming from them in Civ 5 but instead were genuine deals and I found myself accepting more than a few of them throughout my time playing in singleplayer. The map looks no less than beautiful aswell I think it makes a lot more sense to have the places you currently don't have a unit or city or an ally's unit's or cities appear as an old timey map. I found this fog of war as you might call it made the game almost have a scare factor to it as you continued on an example would be when I was playing a multiplayer game I had just taken three of anothers players cities via my navy and then agreed to not take any more so we made peace. The guy I took the city from had an alliance with another player so he could see his units and I could hear him laughing slightly sometimes and saying RIP me which clearly meant that the units he was seeing convinced him of my defeat. But because of the fog of war I had no idea where these crazy units were so I had no idea where this attack might come from. Right up until he declared war and I could finally see his units I had absolutley no idea how big or where his force was and let me tell you his force was certainly large I lost two of the cities I had taken from him within 5 turns and I signed a peace treaty with him soon after when we realised how big of a threat the Aztects were when it came to winning the game. Overall although I have some problems with the game I still believe it to be miles above the rather disapointing in my eyes Civ 5 and almost next to Civ 4 as my favourite in the franchise I recommend this game,Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI

I know I know get good scrub but here's the thing I was pretty okay at Civ 5. I'm not saying I was hardcore good or anything (I could only get up to level 4 or whatever) but I could at least freakin win sometimes. With Civ 6 it's just not happening. Moreover when I tried googling how to win this game the pages I was reading made very little sense to me. So I thought to myself ""Okay maybe I can't just go in level 4 (Prince?) on this one let's start at level 1 that will be easier."" Oh pity the fool friends for it was I. No matter what flipping level I play this game on I cannot win! I have no idea how the other civs get so far ahead of me in science and culture immediately and what I could be doing to kick more butt. It is endlessly frustrating because I love the graphics and the creative new characters but this game makes me want to throw my laptop out the window.

Even putting the bugs aside the game itself just does not feel as engaging as Civ V did (although Civ V was not perfeect there were a lot of problems with that game too). Maybe it is because the districts feel a bit too much like micromanagement. Again personal preference. There were some memorable Civ V games that I really enjoyed I can't say the same about Civ Vi.

2016-10-30,0,0,1903,False,Not Recommended,"I love the majority of the civ series. This one is not the worst nor is it the best.This one is better than Civ 5 but not as good as Civ 3 or 4. I haven't played 1 or 2 in so long I can't compare since I remember how much I loved the games but I'm not sure if my recollection is accurate enough of those two to compare.Over all the best of the breed remains Civ3 with Civ4 being a close 2nd.There are several game design flaws in this game. Not just ""Oh I wish they'd done 'this' or 'that'.The game is just full of changes. Most of which are very obviously change for the sake of change rather then change to make it a better game.Diplomacy does not work at all. It is never rational or reasonable. And it progresses fairly quickly to everyone hates everyone so it is not just broken in the human v. AI. An example you crush a foe they are down to their last city and they beg for peace but the only terms they will accept is with you giving them all your cash on hand and all the cash you earn every turn and give them back a couple of the cities you captured. What you can ask for in diplomacy is broken. I was at war with Sumeria. Russia and India hated Sumeria and had ""denounced them"". But I could not ask them to join in the war I could only ask them to start a new war against each other. You can't even do basic things like share maps. Declarations of war have nothing to do with their ability to win the war or even their preparedness to wage a war. The chinese declared war with only 4 military units not a single one of which was close to current tech. Also the AI declaring love or hate based on nonsensical things is just plain stupid. Why in the world would any nation declare affection for another because the other built a factory a sailboat or hate one because they built a fancy light house? it is random nonsense in the place of actual logic based diplomacy. Economics does not work at all. A 6 city empire can make just as much or more cash as a 40 city one. Trade routes are more important than any thing else. In fact most everything else (economically) can be ignored until your trade routes are full and then only build it when you don't have anything more important to build. In a game I recently played a 6 city empire had a larger military and more cash on hand than mine with close to 40 cities.Road build ""works"" but is done in the most annoying way they could devise. Workers can not build roads only military engineers can but should have been called ""Combat engineers"". ""Combat engineers"" can only be built in cities with a ""barracks"" (now called an encampment). They can only build 2 roads (or other items) and then disappears. ""Caravans"" (now called Traders) will sometimes build roads (and will other times decide to go over water). So you are stuck using one of your cities to nearly constantly build ""road builders"" since these units take about as long to build as most actual military units.The tech tree is short and completed rather quickly. At which point everyone is equal for however long the game lasts. Boring.City management is cumbersome. There are no build ques. Unlike previous versions you can't simply drag a city ""worker"" to the new task. You must lock all the citizens in place except for the only one you want to move. Well now that makes perfect sense to no one. click on and Lock 20 rather than just click on the one you want to move.City state is a cute idea done badly. You surround a city state. A rival can send enough envoys to become their ""Suzerain"" and the city state will then follow that empire to war. The equivalent of this occurred. Kansas city decided that Taiwan was their most favorite place in the world. For some reason Taiwan declared war on the USA. So Kansas City followed their lead. They send out half a dozen spearmen to face down the american tanks. Sending envoys leads to that city state granting your civilization their magic power um ok??Naval power is a joke. Most of the ships of previous games have been removed. Even cargo ships are non existent since just moving a unit in to the water turns them in to a transport ship.Air power is poorly and awkwardly done as well. Even the AI seems to know it since I played to 2096 and never did see an enemy plane.Military power in general is going to disappoint. If you play to for a domination victory you'll hate this the most of all. The AI uses no logic at all. Units are just randomly sent your direction. A few ""artillery"" units but not escorted. Unit combat strength make no sense. APC's can destroy a max tech tank. A tank can attack and destroy a helicopter so even the old rock paper scissors part of the old combat logic is broken. Cavemen damage tanks with their sticks. There are game imbalancing things which can not be undone. For example one AI had a tank ""base"" strength of 107. While in my case they had a base strength of 90. I compared policies government bonuses religions and so forth. So far as I can tell I had all the stuff which gives you a bonus and he had none. It was not one unit which happened to be high level but all this units had a 17 point ""head start"" within nothing in the game giving it to him. This 17 point head start translates in to needing a 3 1 advantage in number to prevail. Not impossible but given the way units work in game (limited stack possibilities 1 unit per tile) it was vexing. The only thing equalizer was the AI's lack of tactics or logic beyond drive our stuff towards the nearest city in an unorganized mob.The game over all feels half baked (as in they took it out of the oven before it was done).The nations and leaders bonuses and such are not at all equal. I doubt much attention was payed to game balancing.The load times turn lengths responsiveness are all bad. Even on very high end computers. Scrolling the map up to move a unit for example is very time consuming as it is hit or miss if the map will scroll at all.There are more issues but for me these are the high lights. Your love/hate of the game will depend on how much control you want (the more you want the less you'll like this game). If you have played and enjoyed the previous versions (other than 5) this may well impact your ability to enjoy this one. If you like a 'war' game this one will drive you nuts.",Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI

I skipped the Civ beyond game so I'm not sure how this compares to that but what I do know from being an old timey Civilization 2 guy playing on my Dad's PC is that this game just trashes the civilization lineage. Civ 6 is garbage.The Humble Bundle is still worth it because at least you'll get other games in the bundle for $12 but I'm not sure I could justify buying this game separately for $12 on its own.

2016-10-24,0,0,55,False,Recommended,I was always expecting this game to be good I trust Firaxis and any other developers working on Civilization to make it a good game although normally you have to wait for the inevitable DLC to be released that fixes 90% of the game by adding some new mechanics etc. (Civ 5 being the primary example as most waited for Brave New World before they could enjoy it).This game however has been completely different. I have played this for 30 hours (as of 24th October) and I started and finished multiple games of Civilization and each game that I have played has felt different from the last in some way. The victory types feel quite balanced science victory and religious victory are probably the easiest I have done so far the most challenging being domination due to the warmonger system declaring war on Civilizations make it a challenge to invade and take the enemy city. The religious victory is fun to play with because you still need to have high science to get faith buildings to allow Apostles and Missionaries to be mass produced to spread around the world. I have found that the religious victory is more fun in large player games (8+ players) otherwise it feels a little easy. The science victory feels quite balanced as their are a lot of steps to the space race which allows other civilizations to work on other victories so it can get quite clutch towards the end of a game.Cultural victory can be fun although it feels quite slow for a large part of the game then towards the end when you can farm antiquities for your theatrical district then you start to make a lot of progress.As for the games performance I can run it on my laptop (Lenovo Thinkpad X220 so if you want a comparison check that) it also runs on my PC although it has a GTX1080 so I won't write much about the performace as that quite honestly is pointless sorry. As for the games options and things like that the settings can be altered to get it to run on nearly any system from what I can tell. Overall I recommend the game to anyone even those who aren't 'good' at strategy games as it is easy to learn. Also the game has Sean Bean who makes the narration ING AMAZING.Pros Easy to learn Has Sean Bean on narration Multiple and actually working victory types Graphically pleasing Great Performance Beautiful UI Each civ feels different and plays completely different from othersCons A few more civs could be nice although these have already been confirmed as coming soon There are currently a few exploits (Near infinite units by selling them when nearly dead Trading needs a workover the AI you trade with refuses 1 extra gold but you can glitch them into handing over everything they own Discussion system is poor you can't tell people not to settle close to you until they already have8.5/10 would recommend.,Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI

There could be some improvements in AI but that can be said for all previous Civ games and I don't think it deserves the harsh negativity.My personal experience with Civ VI is generally positive there are lots of improvements that can be done which they probably will add in DLCs/expacs in the future. I had a lot more fun with Civ VI than Civ V base game the game is now not as oversimplified and the graphic and sound is a lot better and some new systems were added which added some needed depth into the game.So don't let all the negative comments dissuade you if you're a Civ fan that did not enjoy Civ V base game.,Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI

There's literally no penalty to spamming cities and the loyalty system kinda encourages it. The AI build nothing but warriors basically and they wind up just being able to storm cities with waves of them. I like the idea of districts but the Wonders have basically been destroyed and are nowhere near as worth they were in Civ V. I know I'm bias to Civ V but it's just so much better of a game. I can literally sit there and play Civ V all day. I can BARELY get over 100 turns into Civ 6. I heavily regret this game and until some serious balances are made I will not be playing it further.

It will make the few problems seem much smaller. ANYWAYS..I have only 1 official game under my belt but seeing as I'm almost at 40 hours of gameplay I feel it's a good time for my initial review. There is much to appreciate from the developers this time around as they deffinately tried to up the ante so to speak on the Civ to Civ interaction and diplomacy. Was a bit hit and miss with a very loose cannon minded A.I behind nearly every cpu Civ you meet. But on to the meat and potatoes PROs + I like the new district mechanics though I wish there were more (quantity and variety of effects) buildings for each district+ I like the new builder mechanics (Having only 3 uses is a welcomed change as I no longer have 15+ builders sitting around taking up space)+ City states are more interesting and play a more needed role than prior games.+ Split research and civics trees is more good than bad. Still clunky but I like the direction they took it.+ Better than Civ 5 was pre expansions but with seemingly drunk A.ICONs Religion is painful No diplomatic victory option. It was janky in Civ 5 but it enabled some gameplay options that are missing from this game (like focusing on economy with mostly peaceful intentions). The AI is as bad as all the reviews say The start location scripting/city placement issues are as bad as the reviews say (rumors of another civ spawning directly next to people leading to turn one domination) I appreciate what the devs attempted to do with the AI agendas to give them some diversity but it turned the AI civs into loose cannons. With almost non existant diplomacy it's a bad combonation. No penalties for building wide no benefit to building tall.I would say pick it up through Humble Bundle while you can (just a few days left!) or get it on sale elsewhere.(Shoutout to igmatto I borrowed their Pro/Con list as a starting point &lt 3),Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI

I've never known anything like it. Given the price I'd urge Firaxis to fix their buggy multi player before messing about with DLC and expansions. With the above in mind I've no choice but to 'down vote' Civ 6.,Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI

With some Gods and Kings and BNW like expansions VI has the potential to be the best yet!Widening cities into districts is a really neat new feature and city state mechanics are better in VI already than in V. The religious victory is boring but all other victories are fun to pursue. Some Civs (Norway) are just awful and need some buffing but most civs offer a lot of unique abilities and units/infrastructure to make each game you play new and exciting. The soundtrack is also amazing!It does seem like the civs bias towards culture victories and I'd love to see some more science focused civs!,Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI

I really like the progression of the game through the decades but I feel the latest installment lost a few ""lessons learned"" from past games.Likes. The split trees of advancement for social and education. Brilliant. How it affects units buildings governments is ""spot on"". The fact that certain ""prerequisite"" are required for wonders. Awesome the only thing I like to see is a bonus build percentage for the actual civilivation who built it (to give the civilization histrical credit) Ex. Pyramids (2x build speed for Eqyptions). Theological combat. Still gives the thrill of battle without losing all of your advances in diplomacy as long as you don't take it too far that is.Dislikes. The Tech tree. Having to scroll through it is a pain. The previous trees were way better in this regard. Theology overlays. Way too hard to see what is underneath when moving clergymen. Graphics. Interesting. I wonder what the actual target demographic for this game is now. Info panels. Not having the columns ""sort"" the information from low to high high to low is a pain. My biggest ""pet peeve"" is doing away with the initial location ""reboot"" and having to reload everything in the main menu until I don't get Montazuma starting his civilization in the middle of the desert. Also having to rechoose EVERY aspect of starting a game (ex. difficulty leader map size etc.). Also why can't ""chained"" units ""auto explore"" together? It seems a natural fit to have a land combat unit linked with a exploring sea vessel. Historically this is accurate as well. Remember the Conquistadors? Units. It took me forever where to find the unit list without the Military Advisor. For those who never have found it click on a unit's name. Not showing a unit's move length in other player's territory. Not showing an artilliary or air units attack range. Overall I recommend this game. Realistically I am thinking of returning to Civ V for my Civ ""fix"".",Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI

2016-11-05,0,0,36,False,Not Recommended,What a disappointment!So many of the little annoying things that were resolved or less of an issue in Civ 5 are issues in Civ 6. If you take the time to do an advanced setup to a game and it starts you off in the jungle at a total disadvantage there's no quick restart. So you'll have to back all the way out the game DOESN'T save your previous settings so you have to create it all over again before rolling the dice. Civ 5 had a great quick restart button that resolved this. Takes so much more time to get started and you have fewer options to choose from makes NO sense. What happened to raging barbarians or the other extras you could add to the world you create? I'm sure there will be some additional add on I'll have to pay extra for to get it in the future. I logged over 1 000 hours in Civ 5 and I doubt I'll do 1/10th of that with the way the game is now.

First of all with the barbarians attacking you over and over again even before turn 20 and etc... that can make your early game really annoying. And another thing is how (and again imo) the culture victory seems so easy considering the other types of victory and sometimes even inevitable even if you dont want to.I m sure you all notice that the computers research that doubles the tourism is way too abusive.My final note is that the major problems that have been pointed out by most players like the AI. and other bugs have been improved and i think all the little problems will be solved soon with patches (this guys listen to the community the prove is this fall 2016 patch).And overall it s a great game with the potential of getting even better.,Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI

This looked like an awesome purchase and what might be an awesome game especially based on how highly my friends praised this game. As I started the game the in game tutorial AI said one line I was then prompted with a selection to chose whether or not I was new to the whole Civilization franchise or new to just Civilization 6. I am brand new to the Civilization franchise so I selected that option. Following the prompt went away and nothing happened. Nata. Nothing. Apparently if you have no idea how to play the game whatsoever you're still expected to know exactly how to play. I waited a solid 5 or so minutes for something to happen and for someone to help me but I guess I'm just not worthy enough to learn how to play the game. Oh well.,Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI
2016-10-25,0,0,26,False,Not Recommended,Bottom line A buggy unbalanced disappointment. Wait for patches at best the first expansion at worst.To put things in perspective I've had it for eight hours and have beaten the AI on 'Deity' level already. Having played all of the series since Civ 2 I know they all have their own exploitable/broken elements but not to this degree.If this were an early access version it'd be one thing but it's not this is a full price game. There's not a lot of point in re treading the same complaints as everyone else but I may as well run off a few of the worst elements for the sake of it (i) Awful UI missing loads of important information e.g. where your city will next expand its borders. (ii) I hope you liked having to re confirm all of your trade routes every thirty seconds in Civ 5 because it's back and now you have to do it for spies as well! It very much feels like any 'improvement' in the amount of mid game peacetime activity the player has to engage in is more down to this sort of busy work than any fundamental shift in the game's focus or depth. (iii) Even the main menu seems to be broken having forced me to log out of my machine both times I've quit the game to get it to terminate properly.On the plus side the new districts model is nice and culture has been reined back in so that it now requires actual effort to win a cultural victory rather than more or less receiving it by default. On the down side (iv) Religious victories are broken as hell at the moment.I know Civ 5 took a lot of flak when it first launched but having played through vanilla Civ 5 recently to satisfy my curiosity after so many years with the expansions it was fun in its own sparse way. Eight hours into Civ 6 and I'm probably going to head back to Endless Legend and Stellaris for my 4X fix until some balance patches (or even the first expansion) arrive.,Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI
2018-02-24,1,1,21,False,Not Recommended,"This game is garbage just like Civ 5 was. If like me Civ 4 was for you the highpoint of this series then avoid this rubbish at all costs. ""One unit per tile"" completely ruined the game. The limit of one unit per tile seems to have broken the AI entirely which you'll notice is one of the main complaints you hear even from people who enjoy the game. Not to mention that it's totally immersion breaking (a rare achievement for something as abstract as a strategy game) tedious to manage (like playing a board game with too many peices) and entirely misplaced in a 4X If you don't like doomstacks then don't play 4X. This is a strategy game strategy games are about resource management and so the combat in a 4X should refelct that. It's about managing the composition of your armies like any other resource in the game and doomstacks are the natural expression of that. If you want real fighting in your game go play Total War or any tactics game. What a stinker!",Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI

2016-11-15,0,0,729,False,Recommended,"I will start by saying that by no means is this a perfect game and that there are things that can be improved upon however in saying that the release of this game is very satisfying as a whole and the game as it is exists far from a bad state in the same way Civilization BE was.These are my issues with the game Fresh Water This is a cool concept but it's very tedious in my opinion and cripples cities that don't have good tiles around them further. You can only spend so many turns wandering around and Aquaducts come in quite late. Neighbourhoods come in even later which only makes it worse. This amongst other issues makes Coastal cities kind of not that good unless you start next to a river.Tile Occupation This is a general term I'm going to use to regard districts and wonders which both devour the yields of a tile as far as I'm aware which can mean you well obviously lose yields. This is doubly an issue in water rich/coastal areas where all you have in countless empty water tiles and water doesn't yield a whole lot or has any wonders or buildings that act like Petra it seems. You do get a few buildings but they only provide so much. You could make the argument that you don't need to put a city adjacent to the coast now with the Harbor district though that's not always an option with water accesibility as mentioned before and especially early on you don't have your aquaducts.Some minor issues off the top of my head Lack of ability to restart the game in the pause menu. The game ""forgets"" settings you put for a map (resource amount map type etc) which needs to be redone every time. Aside from that however I do like almost everything else about the game. The district system as a whole is amazing and allows a lot of design and town planning for players. The changes to great people is really really good and makes them as useful as Wonders in most cases. The Civics Culture and Tourism changes are also 10/10 in my opinion. Before Tourism felt like it was a tacked on thing that you could only really do in the midgame if you weren't lucky with Wonders. Now it feels like something you can work towards much better if you put the effort in from the get go.Overall I feel Civ 6 is an improvement. I would however wait a patch to have everything ironed out as the game in itself is in a state where its problems are only really patch demanding issues and aren't really all that game breaking as a whole.

2016-11-20,0,0,35,False,Recommended,Yet another Civilization game. Is it worth it? Short answer yes. It does feel like an advancement over Civ V (with DLCs!).I didn't like the graphics when I saw the first trailer but in game it looks gorgeous! Sadly optimisation isn't the best. My PC with i5 6600k and R9 390 struggles on highest details in the end game when most of the map is uncovered and there are lots of units on the screen. DX12 patch fixed it a little bit but it still makes my PC hot like a Mount Doom. Also I love Sean Bean as a narrator the quotes get old after couple playthroughs but I cannot complain.They made many little changes which in my opinion are brilliant. I will write about some of them.You have districts! Your city is no longer a one tile with improvements around but a real metropolis! You need build them to prosper but it is also devastaing when foreign army will destroy one of them. Wonders are built on a tile as well! It does feel much better to have it like that. Also you need a specific tile to build it. You want to build Pyramids? Well do you have a desert tile...? No? You are on Tundra what did you expect!The builders have only a couple uses and then they disappear. They also don't build roads the roads will spawn naturally when the trade routes are established. You remember that wonderful road between you and your neighbour? He is now using that road to transport that huge cannon just to your doorstep I love it.You now generate envoys for city states no longer buying them back with loads of money. But I don't feel that they matter as much as they did in Civ V there is no United Nations.There is a religion victory but it isn't fleshed out enough. Are you playing on a small map with Brazil and try to go for a domination victory? Well watch out because missionaries and apostles don't sleep. Also now there is theological combat and it isn't the best thing to win those fights everytime because when a religion units dies it can create a relic. Also everytime I try to win with religion I win with culture.Online speed in game. I'm one of those people that jsut can't play on standard speed it is so slow. I appreciate that you can choose from online speed to marathon speed.AI isn't the best it never was. Atleast I know why I was denounced and can do something about it. I could go on and on but the bottom line is this game is really good. It's not cheap but believe me you will spend countless hours playing it.If you're not familiar with the series maybe wait for a discount but I think this game it's a great starting point much better than Civ V with DLCs.,Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI

It has a slot of good points there's things i really like (the new civics system for example) and there's things i'm not keen on (the fact that another civ spawns right next to you is really annoying) but all of this becomes a bit irrelevant as it continuously crashes and always at the same point around turn 500. i've researched the issue and people have been reporting it since Nov 16 so for approx 90% of the time the game has been out they have known of the issue (they have replied to posts about the issue) but to this day they haven't fixed it. I've done all the checks my PC specs are fine but it still happens.I've played Civ since Civ 3 i even bought the god awful beyond earth game and i do enjoy them for the most part but this game is so annoying i can't recommend it as it's so buggy which is a shame because the potential for a good game is there but until they pull their finger out and get the basics right I can't say it's worth buying even with discount,Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI

There I saw the ILS bug (Infinite Load Screen) sounded a lot like my problem and with solutions! Well I spent all day running through each option and installing and reinstalling the game.

2017-04-21,0,0,1228,False,Not Recommended,Being a long time fan of the series and lots of hours on the game I must say I have a love/hate relationship with Civ 6. Lots of good ideas went into this game with the strategical placing of the districts but the AI either makes it too easy or too hard. There is never this good balance to enjoy the game until the end. Diplomacy is really getting on your nerve all the time and is dumb as you wont believe. Civs that are getting crushed should at least be looking for alliances with same sized civs. AI is a bit too much one minded/ideological and not enough realistic/realpolitik to make it believable.Those fixed agendas are simply simple minded stupid. Result is you will often realize too late one civ has crushed its neighbors and become an unstoppable giant on the other continent you have not met yet most often the Mali for some reason. The handicap on harder difficulties should come on a continuous path during the game and not as much at the start. You will often find at the start your nearest competitor with two more military units one more settler and some workers. This is simply too much while you get only a warrior and a settler.And then the AI is not quite opportunistic with its units. For instance a troop inside a city will never attack one of your injured unit at the wall. And then this tendency of AI of putting its first city just outside your border even before meeting you is just plain cheating on its part. Your first city act as a magnet for unmet scouts and settlers while you won't have the slightest idea where your opponents are. And the fact you don't get any compensation for failed wonder is so annoying and unrealistic.It just disappears out of thin air often without even any indication why. Previous civs managed wonders better. All in all this could be so much better and less frustrating.,Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI

2016-10-28,0,0,17,False,Not Recommended,Full disclosure been playing Civ since the very first Civ. Didn't hate on Civ 5 and easily played 800+ hours with each an every version until this one. After playing this for 5 6 hours I finally think I can qualify why I don't like this game. 1. Civ 6 is too slow. Civ games always had a pace to them and for the most part I would get into a rhythm playing them and stuff would just click. Civ 6 on the other hand has two issues. First the turn time taken by the AI is far too long longer even than the too long times of Civ 5. Second the pace of the game is simply too slow. I don't know if there's just too much going on too much to attend to or what but it just doesn't work for me. The individual components (districts/spread out cities new barbians builder) seem to do ok on their own but the combination is what appears to make the game drag.2. Information is pretty much hidden. There's a lot going on under the covers in the game but the game does a terrible job of explaining much of it. The advisor priorities make very little sense much of the time unless there's still a ton of information I need to discover. Thumbing through the Civlopedia is a joke it's thoroughly lacking in good information.The graphics don't really bother me. Maps appear smaller which also helps diminish the grand scale of the game. All in all the game isn't horrid but it sure seems to lack the magic Civ experience so prevalent in previous iterations.Maybe like Civ 5 it'll come into its own in another year or so. One can hope.,Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI

2018-09-10,0,0,417,False,Recommended,Overall I enjoy this installment and it offers several new mechanisms that differentiate it from Civ V (my first civ game). The district placement prevents every city form being a Jack of all trades and makes land even more valuable. Restricting movement onto/off of cliffs and requiring the actual movement cost to move onto terrain (i.e. moving on flat ground having one movement point remaining then moving on a hill that requires two is no longer allowed) creates new considerations that need to be made when planning troop movement for battles as well as new options for defending cities. A new diplomatic screen that shows why the AI likes or hates you can be extreamly helpful. Religion and espionage are included in the base game again and not an expansion (although a world congress type organization is still missing). Several other changes also help to change up gameplay but you can read the description to know if they are things that interest you. This does not mean it has no flaws. Far from it. The AI as I m sure you have read in countless other reviews is extremely underwhelming and relies on stat boosts on the highest difficulties to remain competitive. This is not unique to Civ VI but it is a bit more obvious with things like preplanning out the best spot for future districts optimal city placement troop movement that protects more venerable units and better overall placement of units leading up to and during warfare all being things the AI struggles a great deal with. The game also has no way for you to remove districts in cities without razing the city itself to the ground. This can cost a fortune in gold science culture and production in the long run as population directly correlates to the number of districts you are allowed to have. So a city that would be perfect to produce tons of science can t build a campus because the previous owner wanted gold and culture and it doesn t produce enough food on its own to raise the population to unlock the next district in a reasonable time without redirecting countless trade routes. The option to raze a city is only available on the turn you capture it and increases the warmonger penalty. Furthermore even on marathon the game goes by a bit faster than I would like. Some of the reviews I have seen point out that even on Epic speed the eras pass before you can construct units and your army is almost immediately obsolete. This has not been my experience but I generally keep a relatively small force compared to my empire s size through the early stages (exploiting the difficulties the AI has with troop movement and misunderstanding of siege mechanics to save money and build up some infrastructure) and have enough high production cities by the mid game to make it a none issue to create new troops quickly. Those are the primary issues that I still have with the game with most of the other problems being patched out (not being able to create melee units if you researched swordsman with no access to iron balance issues and GUI errors). Some smaller things include builders having a limited number of charges (and the ridiculous amount of time it can take to make one on some speeds compared to the improvements they create) and the penalties for warmongering in the late game (including retaliatory strikes when an enemy half your strength declares war on you and you capture a few of their cities before signing a peace treaty to give you a better buffer zone in the future). I don t believe it s game breaking and I understand the concept (even if Mexico attached the U.S. most of the world would still be mad if the top third of Mexico was annexed as a result). If you play online with friends most of this will not apply to you and the difference form previous incarnations will offer a unique 4X experience.,Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI

I spent already over 300 hours in Civ VI and I must say this series is never too old.Civilization VI took my heart by new engine. It's really different than Civ V or Civ BE. After 2 months I didn't remember a lot of things in Civ V this is how the game changed.Districts. I totally loved districts. Unique districts for some civilizations is also great idea. Wonders are taking tiles cities aren't farms anymore. Now when you are creating a city you need to think a lot. Mountains aren't useless they are providing yields for districts. This might be overpowered but it's beautiful how they used just useless tiles. Amenities and housings totally great solution. River giving extra housing luxuries giving extra amenities. I could talk about new things for hours but we don't have time.Art style completely beautiful. I really enjoyed it. I really enjoyed new animations and the day/night cycle on the map. Strategic view is nice for eye.Technology tree absolutely no problems it's set nice.Civics tree and cards with policies this is great solution. You are discovering parts of the culture and you're not getting every policy one by one you are choosing some of them. You are well limited and also this extra cards for some civs are great.Trading system it's ok and finally it is showing nice and clearly.Buildings/wonders/units Only one thing here wonders are just awesome.AI That's true that AI is a bit weird. Also some civs are overpowered. Really overpowered. The game can't go normal with such strong civs. I think as soon as Workshop will be alive people will improve all civs on their own way. Anyway Barbarians are smarter that's for sure.

2016-11-06,0,0,331,False,Recommended,After a fair amount of gameplay in Civilization VI I can say I'm thouroghly satisfied.I grew up on the Civ series I remember sitting as a kid watching my dad play Civ III. I've played every part of the series from III forward Civ IV Civ V that awful console launch Civ Revolution and a number of DLC and expansions.Civ VI offers extremely interesting new innovations and ideas to the series that I love personally. To start let me say that this game has increased difficulty I've been used to being able to win game after game of Civ V without thought but Civ VI requires thinking through your plan and strategy. It took me by surprise and still in most games I catch myself in suspense not actually knowing if I will or can win the game I'm playing.The new features in gameplay such as Great People Districts and the Culture tech tree make this lanch an engaging and interesting launch as well as they force gameplay in new and unusual ways. I find the districts idea fun entertaining and simple to understand and as an urban planner myself I love the nod to my profession even if it is subtle and simple. Planning out cities has become much more involved than in previous games encouraging thinking about the future of each settler after you found. Considerng the need for space the cover of borders and the need for district bonuses drives a much more in depth process for determining where to found.Great person competition is extremely useful and much more compelling and has become a very competent and competitive gameplay feature. Each great person has specific bonuses as an individual for example Darwin a great scientist grants 500 science for every tile of a great wonder he is adjacent to while Carl Sagan grants 3 000 production toward a space race victory project and Galileo constructs a university and a library in a campus district. Each person has specific benefits that you may want to compete for with other players by gaining Great Person Points which you get from districts. There are a limited number of great persons which makes it all the more competitive. For example Great Prophets are usually all claimed quickly and only a limited number of religions can be founded because of this.Religion has had a welcome and compelling overhaul being transformed into a mechanic similiar to combat but without war. Missionaries and Apostles debate and duel each other and make the religion gameplay into a possible victory condition.

2016-10-30,0,0,153,False,Recommended,I've enjoyed every hour I've put into this game so far. The game has some problems and some bugs to be sure but it's still fantastic. For someone who's been playing games from this series since Civ III (with some dabbling in Alpha Centauri and Call to Power) this game is fantastic. It combines some of the mechanics that I loved from previous games that were removed in Civ V while introducing some brand new mechanics that I love as well (such as districts). The UI has some problems at time but in my opnion it isn't game breaking. If you've played more than just Civ V I think you'll love this game. Otherwise it isn't for everyone just yet I suppose.,Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI

2017-10-21,0,0,68,False,Not Recommended,Please note this review is a citique of the game's payment model and error with AI if you want a legitimate review of the game go elsewhere. But if you want info on the pricing and abosultley horrendous AI I HIGHLY reccomend reading this review.How about you fix the stupid AI and make an expansion pack?Civ 5 release sept 21 2010in the FIRST year we got exactly 12 DLCs. And how many DLCs have we gotten in the first year for 6? 7. That's nearly half the amount of DLCs. And mind you all the Civ 6 DLCs will run you FIVE dollars sometimes up to 10 for dual packs!!! Civ 5? The SINGLE DLC double pack will run you 8 dollars. The rest are either 5 or 3 dollars. Oh wait? 3 dollars for a DLC? Madness that's making it so we get less money.Not only is the DLC for civ 6 slower than 5 it is more expensive and for a far worse product when you count in map size (trust me it is smaller just go on to a random gen map in civ 5 and look at the ocean then go to civ 6 and look at the ocean they might as well make it to that every map has the distance of russia to alaska). Now if the DLC roadmap from 5 has something to go off of we can pobably get an expansion pack this coming year. But the unnamed expansion better have the rework level of a blizzard RTS expansion to make it worthwhile at all as the base game is bland IMO comapared to civ 5.And the AI DONT GET ME STARTED!!! To keep it simple here is a list of scenarios that happened in ONE PLAYTHROUGH Takes away 1 item on your end from a trade AI takes all items off trade and charges you all of your gold income. Take down a civilazation all the AI will think you are a warmonger. 3 Civs declare war then declare war on themselves (Not even ing kidding) and will never send troops to attack you. When you attempt to declare peace they will ask you for gold gems war resources EVERYTHING to declare peace. Then when they ask to declare peace they will give you EVERYTHING they have the NEXT ING TURN. I think you get the point.Get to work Firaxis cause civ 6 is going down the drain (IMO) with the AI and dlc.,Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI

2016-11-08,0,0,34,False,Not Recommended,Sad to say this is probably the last Civ I play after playing them all from Sid's first (after playing civ for 25+ years it maybe time to look elsewhere for something new so I maybe jaded). The new mechanic of districts and builders in my opinion adds little to the game. It does make you plan you cities ahead and reduces the worker spam but in the end it just becomes tedious micromanagement. But the one thing that ruins this game is the subpar AI. It has no idea what it is doing and makes single play boring. If you have a group of friends interested in playing multiplay then go for it but don't buy if you plan to play single player. Hopefully they do some major patching on the AI. I don't mind the change having two research trees and the card system. Sadly I can't recommend this game in the state it was shipped .,Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI
2018-02-22,0,0,740,False,Recommended,Civ6 inherits most elements from BNW and succesfully introduced new concepts and systems to make this franchise more strategically complex and mentally entertaining. New city system Tiles are more precious since each District or wonder occupies one. Terrain and construction on adjacent tiles also lead to bonuses or punishments.Housing affects population growth besides food and amenity. Appeal decides how much housing and tourism a tile could generate. New research system Civic tree is added parallel to originial tech tree with corresponding eras. Advancing in either tree could be advantageous and partially compensates falling behind in the other.Eureka and Inspiration boost progression of a tech or civic once specific condition was met.These changes differ from previous mechanisms in Civ franchise and require much more thoughtful and farsighted layout and priority decisions.Other prominent changes or additions include Religion system expands with religion war and a specific victory type. Cultural victory is reshaped with more tourism sources wonders religion district with religious relic national park and seaside resort on high appeal tiles etc. Government types replace ideologies and unlock with early civics. Adherence to one type brings Legacy Bonuses. Policy Cards resemble Civ5 social policies but can be switched and combined flexibly. City states provide various benefits to suzerains rather than mere yields.Civ6 is visually appealing with bright colors elaborate textures and models decent reflection and shadow effects etc.Day and night cycle and wonder construction replay are new to the franchise as well.The BGM is nice but not as grand as in BNW overall.Just like precedent games the AI still needs improvements as displayed by many ilogical decisions such as choosing settling positions or commanding battles etc.,Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI

2017-07-05,0,0,52,False,Recommended,So. I put over 200+ hours into Civ V across a few accounts before finally giving in and purchasing the next in the series to check out what it had to offer.The way I would describe it is a cleaner simpler to use (In terms of interface and playstyle) game that is well rounded and offers a lot of game time. I'm still currently compelting my first long game (6 hours and about 300 turns in now) and I'm loving it!The game is basically the same game with improved quality and new content to explore (with the only lacking aspect being the maps imo)Get this while it's on the last day of the sale. Even if you have never played the series before this still works as a good entry point to it while also offering more variety for those who have rinsed time in the older versions too!Edit #1 So upon further playtime I have come to the conclusion that I still think the previous Civ V was better than this one simply because of the amount of content put into the DLC's and the way it's layed out isn't so colourful it blows your brain out after a long 6 7 hour session like I sometimes do. But hey it's still a good game with great potential! I reckon I will play a couple more games then wait for more DLC which they hopefully put into a bundle as to encourage more people to buy it as currently I either spend 35 on all of the DLC seperatley or use the 50% off discount to purchase the deluxe edition standalone which is still around the same price also not worth it imo for only around 6 7 more civs and a few more maps. Just wait it out most civ games improve over time with more DLC's!,Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI
2017-05-15,0,0,8,False,Not Recommended,DO NOT BUY! IT'S INCOMPLETE PRODUCT.I've bought it a week ago. There are three type of problems with this game 1) some things doesn't work as described (bugs?) 2) AI turns take quite long time (6 civs + 6 city states) (Intel i7 4771 ram 32GB Nvidia Titan X 12GB) 3) Sometimes the game hangs during the AI turn. The only option is to kill the game start it again and load a save from 2 3 turn ago and replay them (never managed to reload the last save thus concluding is some kind or bug which can be reproduced but is ignored).Despite above problems if you like to punish yourself with a repetitive reload experience the mechanics and introduced elements are pretty interesting. Although one cannot simple open a view where all districts are clearly shown and their impact on each other is shown. Such functionality seems to be mandatory when introducing such feature. And when you think about it for a moment you realize that a district mechanism is not so cool. I mean if you know the buildings from future it's an easy optimization problem. I guess it's a matter of time when someone will create an extension showing how to design an optimal city.,Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI

2018-02-18,0,0,31,False,Recommended,I am someone who logged a large number of hours on Civ V and I can say that this latest addition to the Civ series is a net improvement to the game. While there are many things that I loved about this game such as the district system I will focus on a few things that I think could use improvement. And though I criticize a few things I still love this game and will continue to log many more hours on it.Firstly the AI is pretty annoying. It feels like they're always denouncing you and starting wars though you the player are the only one who really suffers from warmonger penalties which are a bit too strict in my opinion. Also the AI tend to be unreasonable in their trade requests.Perhaps I am just not good enough at the game but another thing that sometimes bothers me is the housing requirement which if you dont build your city near plenty of water can be quite hard to keep up with. If there were even just a few more buildings that provided housing it would be incredibly helpful. Lastly I would just like to reiterate that I love this game and will be playing it quite a bit and while its not perfect I still believe it to be an excellent addition to the Civ franchise.,Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI

2017-10-29,0,0,111,False,Not Recommended,This review is more about the feeling of the game rather than getting into the mechanics. It really isn't as charming as the previous Civs. The graphics and UI remind me more of a mobile game. Similar to what they did to The Sims 4. The district feature is a nice touch and I feel like Civ Leaders have more personality and weight to them. But at the end of the day as you'll read in many of these reviews it's just not quite living up to Civ 5's standards.,Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI
2017-07-14,0,0,9,False,Recommended,Ok so it seems like all the upsides and downsides vary per user so my tip is if you trust the over all steam reviews for this game D O N T. My gripes with this game is i dont like the religion system and the religion victory is pretty stupid when playing single player although i imagine in multiplayer it could be intresting. I also dont like the animated kids movie feeling the style gives me but the art style they give the map and units i do like. And also many people seem to not like the new governing system. See this is the reason i say they vary because unlike what others seem to think i enjoy the district system. Because it feels more sensible because why would you have baracks in the heart of the city when you can have a whole plot of land for milltary things that do those sorts of things. I also like how workers work by a charge system and work instantly. It makes the beggining of the game feel more rewarding and generaly lessens the hassle of them getting stolen back and forth alot. I also like how you can personalize your government more. another thing i like is that trading in this game is less of a hassle and more fun and rewarding. with cities giving different values and build on their own without the help of workers. Over all i dont think it better than 5 but it is different and not worse so in short. Not fantastic but good.,Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI

2018-01-05,0,0,13,False,Not Recommended,Sadly I cannot recommend this game to anyone. While there are some really great features (like the tech and society trees) there are also horrible elements like religious combat that completely take you out of the experience (and the AI that makes diplomacy basically irrelevant). But two things destroy this game so completely that I have absolutely no desire to ever play it again. First the district system which is the bane of any immersion. Sure on a tile based strategy game you cannot expect realistic scaling but the one tile cities of Civ V made you actually feel like building a vast Empire with strategically placed cities and lots of productive countryside and infrastructure between them. Now half of your tiles are cities and there is simply no feeling of distinction. The second great sin is the utterly horrible mind blowingly idiotic art style. I said districts remove the immersion from cities but even worse is that they now have about four buildings and look more appropriate for a mobile game where it's all about min maxing and nobody cares about worldbuilding.In Civilization V I would always enjoy having a long single player game building my empire not to achieve victory but more like a worldbuilding sandbox even to RP a bit I would be immersed in the experience and forget about time. If someone forced me to play Civ VI again I'd probably just click whatever my advisors say and watch a good TV show or a football game on the second monitor.,Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI

All of the casual problems still in the game show how much effort they put in to this game (like changing a worked tile doesn't change the city's displayed growth/production time). Also UI changes end up needing a lot more clicks to manage your empire not very intuitive.

2017-10-04,0,0,100,False,Not Recommended,I was late to the Civilization series. I watched people play the earlier Civ games but my first purchase was Civ V. Civ V was a work of art to me. The music art and interaction with the other AI Civs is just great. I've logged 1555 of online hours and and about as many offline. All of my games are diety and the games are incredible on a huge real world map of Civ V a great and challenging game every time. I was extremely excited about Civ VI but was quickly dissapointed. There were plenty of great ideas but it all came down to the basic feel of the game for me. In Civ V you start to actually hate some Civs ( which is awesome ) I want enemies that feel like enemies. Civ VI just made me feel like I was playing against Disney Characters and Deity was far too easy to beat. I'm hoping that Civ VII will be more like a Civ V as far as feel with some of the ideas and tweeks added from CivVI. Until then you'll catch me on Civ V.,Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI

2017-02-24,0,0,37,False,Recommended,I've noticed the majority of the reviews are hating on the AI and not liking the art style. While I have to say personally I like the art style I get it isn't for everyone. Especially since it's a lot more cartoony compared to the other games. But I'll start with my thoughts then adress the AI complaints. Pros Districts add a nice micro manage to the game with series benifits when maximized. Ramped up barbs make the early game much better in my opinion The new policy system is much better Tech tree is better Reduction of wonder powers helped with balance in both mid and early game Religion Victory making religion semi viable The art style is nice in my opinion Penalties for going to war The housing system helps keep extreme agression at bay (I've always been more of a tall player anyways so I don't mind the more restricted city building) The seperation of leader and country bonuses is very nice Cons Religion is still pretty much useless. However if 1 player decides to focus on it then others are forced to in order to not lose which is nice Learning curve is much steeper in this game (although this is not a bad thing. It just means newer players are going to struggle more) Penalties for war are very harsh and often shut down the losing member(s) of the war Diplomicy is fairly weak. There's not a world congress however this has been adressed by the devs. They're waiting to see how things develop in the games playerbase to see how they want to gear congress Ramped up barbarians can be extremely punishing if you aren't prepared The housing system is also very limiting (also not a bad thing. However due to the map generations sometimes you end up with terrible cities because you needed a resource that you cant have access to near a mountain river or coastline.)Okay. For the most part I feel those are all pretty straight forward. As for background on me I have a few hundred hours in Civ V and have looked a lot into this game beyond just the 30+ hours I have in it.As for the AI problems. Yes I will agree that the AI is terrible in this game. However the AI was terrible in Beyond Earth and Civ V. Even with all 3 expansions in Civ V the AI is pretty trash. They're pushovers that declare war on you for little to no reason. The AI has never been good. I understand everyone is upset that the AI is bad but it's always been bad. Play this game with friends and you have an entirely different experience. Players will always beat AIs in these kinds of games for enjoyability. Trust me.This game isn't bad by any means. I personally think it's a step up from Civ V especially now that there have been enough updates to bring some of the basic functions back (like city naming queues etc.).Mid game got sped up by quite a lot Late game toned down and Early game is much cleaner in my opinion. Now we don't have 3 or 4 eras of mid game which to some might feel weird but I like the quicker feel of the game.All in all this is still a pretty good game. It isn't quite to level as full expansion Civ V but it's on the path to it. It has a lot of neat features and once you've learned how to utilize them it works out to be a very fun game.,Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI

Firaxis is making the game a little bit better with each patch and I enjoy watching the game develop. However I cannot recommend the game in its current form at the current price. As many have said the AI is pathetic and aggrevatingly so. The higher difficulty levels are worthless. And the game's pace of production reletive to technology is frustrating (though I'm sure the workshop will eventually take care of that). My advice to a propective buyer is to play a game that has better value or just wait about a year to buy a more mature Civ 6 at a more reasonable price.Or just buy the game and enjoy the process.,Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI

2017-03-13,0,0,62,False,Not Recommended,I've been addicted to the Civilization franchise since the first game but this game very much feels like a backward step since IV and V. The graphics are colourful and certain new features such as coastal terrains and active progression are great. However the AI is dreadful the overall balancing for each difficulty level is botched AI forward settle within only one or two tiles because of the new soft border set up barbarians are rampant and progress through technology faster than actual civilizations and resources clearly spawn to encourage expansion. There is no benefit of buildng tall as in Civ V which was a welcome change and there is no downside to warmongering if all of the AI hate you anyway. Even on low difficulties there is no time to breathe and enjoy building because diplomacy is broken. Lastly I sure that this will change with time but the current leader roster is devoid of diversity and the inclusion of countries like Australia and Poland (despite fan popularity) really is a joke when there isn't yet a single South American South East Asian or Polynesian civilization included so far. European and colonial civilizations also have a massive bias against the rest of the world. Allowing both leaders of Greece to play in a single game feels like a cost saving excuse to not provide more content even if you take into account the historic city states.I'm addicted to the franchise and hope that further expansions fix issues here. However I'll only be playing for novelty. I'll be going back to Civ V for my actual Civ fix.,Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI

2016-11-26,0,0,60,False,Not Recommended,"I don't think I have anything to say that hasn't already been said however I'll try to say it in a more concise way. As a long time fan of the Civilization series I cannot recommend this game at this time although I believe this could be the greatest Civ game to date if Firaxis makes the appropriate changes with DLCs.Pros A lot of the game mechanic changes from Civ V are fun and help remove the monotony of earlier versions. Something as small as delegating road building to your trade units instead of having to manually build road on each tile is fantastic. District building adds another level of complexity to the game that is rewarding and wonders are very pleasing to look at now. Happiness is now local and not empire wide which is fantastic. Feels like the player is punished less for wanting to go big.Cons AI. As I believe you will see with most reviews the AI RUINS this game. Part of this is just due to general idiotic AI but then the agenda system really takes it to another level. The developers were either really lazy or really dumb when it comes to this feature what they should have done was exclude random agendas that contradict the civ's historical agenda. Here's an example of what I mean in one of my playthroughs I had impressed another civilization with my large military which was that particular civilization's historical agenda. The civ came to me and gave me compliments. The next turn however the same civ came to me with threats because it just so happened that their random agenda was ""paranoid "" meaning they also DISLIKED players with big militaries. How could the developers not realize this? It makes the game so stupid which leads to another one of my poitns. Another con is the fact that you can't have any meaningful diplomacy nor does it seem as if you can pursue a less militaristic playstyle. What I really loved about CIv V was the level of strategy added by the world congress. Towards the end of the game it's so fun to enact your Machiavellian desires as you tiptoe around political eggshells to shape the world as you see fit. Although I realize that each game of CIv will require military and combat to some degree Civ 6 seems to predispose you to playing a militaristic game even if it's just due to the paranoia that the AI you're playing with is as devious as HAL from that one famous Stanley Kubrick flick.",Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI
2016-11-27,0,0,168,False,Not Recommended,Great game until my civilization became 'war weary' during peacetime. Then it kept getting worse. Peace for 100s of years! But my citizens were 'war weary' and thus unhappy and eventually revolting because they kept getting MORE weary of the war that did I mention? DIDN'T EXIST AND HADN'T EXISTED FOR 100s OF YEARS.

2017-02-28,0,0,101,False,Recommended,Very different from Civ V but in a refreshing way. Builder charges are a really cool concept and I love the civic system vs the different paths in Civ V. The fog of war map thing is kind of weird but the visible map is beautiful. Districts and tile management spices up the micromanagement side and provides another way to obsess way too much about the optimal choice. Great game so far.,Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI
2017-03-23,0,0,978,False,Recommended,"It's funny. I understand the frustrations regarding the current state of this game but it's only been out for six months. Six months into Civilization V Firaxis released six dlcs one was a free civ another was a double civs/scenario and the other four were map packs. The community absolutely hated Civ V for most of the first year it was released. A bunch of talk about how it was more athstetic but lacked AI and content making it inferior to Civ IV in ""almost every way"" It's still too early to fully appreciate this game. Firaxis seems to be slowly working out the AI through each patch.As they continue to add more civs city states maps and scenarios they'll eventually and hopefully be able to better work out diplomacy war factions and maybe even bigger changes like weather seasons disasters or even historical attributes like plagues world wars or even rebellions and revolutions. I'm not saying that this game is perfect obviously it's not in any way. But understanding how Civ V developed all I have is the highest hopes for the game and patience. I only recommend this game if you're patient and willing to understand the complexity and hard work they're currently putting into Civ VI but if you're looking for a complete game Civilization V is always out there",Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI

2017-03-24,0,0,517,False,Not Recommended,Civ VI is a beautiful shiny toy that is broken and no fun to play with. I held off reviewing this game to give the developers adequate time to address gameplay and bugs and to see if the DLC would enhance gameplay. After 200 hours I uninstalled the game because it's just frustrating. The AI is hopelessly dumb and only gains advantage by penalizing the player at higher difficulty levels. Movement rules are so restricting that it takes 20 turns to move units to the front. Production is frustratingly slow even for maxed out cities. Religious combat shows promise but since the interface doesn't focus on it you may not even know you're under attack unless you keep very close tabs across a very wide empire. Naval combat pointless. Air combat...I haven't even see the AI build an air unit. Graphic glitches carry over from Civ 5 including dancing units and the obscenely slow process of watching an air unit take off fly to its target then fly back to base. You have to watch catapults reload. Why? Great people have been reworked but appear broken (even focusing on culture I can't produce a great writer or artist). Resource restriction often means you're helpless. Late games are always hopelessly deadlocked. All games evolve in the same way with regardless of civilization. No reason to buy the game in this state.UPDATE This game has now been out more than a year. DLC has so far consisted of nation packs and scenarios that no one cares about. OH WOW I CAN PLAY AS AUSTRALIA???? Big deal. I finally saw the AI build an air unit. It did nothing with it as I attacked. I can now get great writers and artists. UI continues to be infuriating. Unit scrollng worse than worthless. Religion needs major rework. Late game still pointless. Game usually crashes the entire computer on exiting. Three stupid splash screens whenever you start. Needless time sinks when dealing with other leaders. Turns take too long partially because the game is animating things you can't even see. Still no reason to buy the game in this state.UPDATE Last update for this game as the 1st expansion is out. Someone is going to look at my 350 hours in this game and think that I enjoy it. I don't. The early game of exploring and founding cities is fun. After that it is a long and unrewarding slog. The AI is simply stupid both on offense and defense. I've never seen the AI use an aircraft other than to fly around a city. I've never seen the AI build an aircraft carrier. I have seen the AI embark a tank army in waters where they know there are enemy submarines...repeatedly. Being 'denounced' an absolute joke. Game still crashes on exit. The expansion just adds more problems. Firaxis should be ashamed.,Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI

In FIFA or Madden you have a ""pass"" button but to make a pass in Rocket League you have to drive your car into the ball at the right speed and angle to send it over to where your teammate is going. You have to create the pass yourself and it can be anything from a hard bounce off the back wall to a soft lob over the defender. Passing shooting dribbling tackles jukes they're all in the game but you have to make them happen yourself not just press the right button. At first just driving car to ball is a challenge but as your skill grows the freedom to create any play you can imagine and execute is unlike anything you'll find in a ""sports game"". Together with the mechanical skill to do what you want with the ball you'll have to develop positional awareness and learn proper rotation and game sense. There are very few games that are consistently rewarding for hundreds or thousands of hours that can keep challenging you as you improve and improve and improve beyond what you ever imagined you'd be capable of. In fact this is the ONLY one I know. Best.Game.Ever.",Rocket League®
2017-05-31,41,557,1528,False,Recommended,When you buy this game it will take about 20 30 hours to actually start hitting balls. By 100 150 hours you'll be flying around the map to score some crazy looking goals (in your opinion). But then that's when the fun actually begins mastering the basic moves of the game is basically mastering 1% of what you can do in this game. You'll end up playing more and more and more until you realize you've just spent three hours in practice hitting the same shot again and again. Yes this game is higly addictive. My favorite game ever without any doubts.,Rocket League®

Great gameplay Marvelous graphics Very competitive Alright singleplayer Tons of customization Easy to pick up hard to master Up to 4 player splitscreen (!!) Cross platform+ Much more to experience for yourself!Cons Servers were pretty bad to begin with but that's fixed now tho' so this should not count as a con.Everything else that I would have written as a con is currently being added so I have no complaints about this game at all.''Just one more game'' everyone.,Rocket League®
2016-01-11,2010,2066,2430,False,Recommended,"Rocket League has one of the best progression systems I've ever seen in a video game before...Rookie You can't hit You are a disgrace to your team and the game.Semi Pro You can now sometimes hit the ball. Don't even try to hit it in the right direction or think about your positioning. You're only Semi Pro so you can just go ahead and hit that ball! You also made a bicycle hit that one time but yeah nah you're still Pro You have learnt how to shoot the ball accurately from the ground. You're the best! Late into Pro level you would have likely looked up advanced tips for Rocket League. Worst mistake of your life. You now know what aerials are. You think you can fly. The ball comes up high and you go for an aerial. Once you jump you fly straight into the ground and continue to do frontflips until you land on your back... What the happened there? Oh. You're using keyboard. Yeah nah time to get a controller head.Veteran You now have a controller and go for terribly unlikely aerials. You think you're good. You can hit the lower aerials consistently and you can now be considered an addition to your team. Congratulations!Expert You can now consistently hit aerials accurately at any height. This game is now your life. You can also score off a wall every now and then. Good times.Master You are now a god to every level lower than you. You have perfected the art of wall shots. You are an extremely cool person. A nice little bonus is that everyone under the level of Pro will now spam ""Sorry!"" every time they do something wrong to you.Legend The most badass looking title you can have. Rocketeer. You probably now have an extreme case of false confidence. Once you get used to the badass title you'll wreck anything and anyone with ease. You can also pull off freestyles consistently. Nice job! Also be sure to prepare for an endless stream of ""You're not good enough for Legend!""Rocketeer You can now 720 freestyle backflip reverse backwards aerial air dribble off a wall with ease. You probably boosted for that Rocketeer tag. But if you didn't still prepare for another endless stream of ""You're not good enough for Rocketeer!""But in all seriousness I absolutely love this game and I'm sure anyone will. I've literally never seen someone dislike this game after they've played 10 hours. (Rocket League moves onto a whole nother level of fun and addiction once you learn how to fly.)If you're still contemplating buying this game after reading this review just trust me when I say it is one of the most fun and addictive games I've ever played (more gripping than Skyrim and GTA). Think about it this way You wouldn't have made it this far through the review if you didn't secretly want this game. Ignore the childish looking pictures on the store page. Just get this game. This is the one.EDIT 2/13/2016 You know a game is amazing when the servers go down and you'd rather train offline than play any of your other 100 games... ty for the read",Rocket League®

2017-11-25,1,1,1352,False,Recommended,"Excelling in sport means knowing when a moment is outside of your control and recognizing when an opportunity is there to seize. In Rocket League both events occur countless times in any given match not surprising for a game heavily inspired by soccer. It caters to the competitive realist who thrills in having sole control of the ball for a few seconds despite knowing it can be snatched at any time. The best part is that you get to kill opponents' dreams and agonize in your own losses from the comfort of a very very fast car.Every moment in Rocket League demands split second judgment. Are you the assertive type who takes control of the immediate situation at the risk of being in the middle of a chaotic unpredictable scrum? Are you more of a long term planner one who watches your cohorts fight over a ball in a corner with the confidence that the ball will inevitably escape. When this happens are you ready at the top of the penalty arc with the hope that the loose ball will roll between you and the goal? This echoes Wayne Gretzky's words of wisdom ""A good hockey player plays where the puck is. A great hockey player plays where the puck is going to be."" Rocket League offers countless opportunities to be Gretzky or Nostradamus.Rocket League thrives on speed and momentum. This is best exemplified by the gravity defying excitement of driving up the side of any of the game's arenas. This ability is useful as well as thrilling. Without the curves along the edges of the pitch cars would simply bang into the wall. Constantly having to reverse and make three point turns over a five minute match would be a disappointing series of momentum ending buzzkills. Rocket League has none of these obstacles. The curved corners means you do not lose momentum. Your tires will smoothly caress these bends as you ride the walls horizontally chasing the ball in parallel with rest of the cars on the pitch. Given that the ceiling is also fair game every player will feel compelled to attempt a gravity defying loop across the width of the roof. The game's physics and your limited boost will prevent you from completing such a stunt but you'll attempt it anyway.The ball in play is comparable to that perpetually bouncing beach ball you find at every music festival only slightly less buoyant. It bounces and flies in unpredictable directions when touched by two parties at the same time. This is where fortune favors the Rocket League sportsperson who embraces chaos. Transcendence comes when you realize you don't have to be in control of the ball at all times you should chase it only when you think you can make a difference.A goal scored ends the fleeting yet fulfilled existence of a ball. In its death the ball's life is celebrated with a literal bang. It's a colorful smoke filled explosion that sends all the cars flying away at heights and velocities that would kill any human in real life. It is so spectacular that you can't help but savor the blast even if you weren't on the team that scored. Rocket League is that rare kind of video game sport where you're compelled to play your best even when you're being blown out 5 1 and there's only a minute left on the clock.There's no shortage of advanced ball handling in online multiplayer. In Rocket League experience leads to tactical thinking. Tactical thinking leads to performing with finesse. You cannot open car doors to use them like arms that would be the equivalent of a handball in soccer. Instead you can spin your car forwards backwards and sideways which is analogous to bicycle kicks and headers. Once you learn to use these moves to advance the ball you are soon ricocheting shots on goal. Over time you also discover that your chances of scoring are boosted by hitting the car closest to the ball rather than the ball itself. It's all obvious highlight reel material which is why the replay save option is so welcome. Learning and mastering these advanced moves makes playing Rocket League endlessly absorbing even after you've logged over 50 matches.Playing a single player season in rookie mode is as useful a practice ground as the training mode itself. Without real life competitors ruthlessly charging to the center of the field for the drop ball you can practice making spectacular goals from midfield. The drawback is that imperfect A.I. applies to both teams meaning that your computer controlled squadmates will average at least one incompetent move per match whether it's taking the ball to the far side of your end of the field or blocking your path to the ball.Rocket League's replay value lies in the draw of constant participation not in a progressive system of unlockable advanced abilities or shoehorned novelty modes. All the arenas are uniform and consistent in shape without any bells and whistles like the terraces in its predecessor Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket Powered Battle Cars. The only variables are the team sizes A.I. difficulty and season lengths. This lack of flexibility adds legitimacy to the sport mirroring the steadfast traditions within many professional sports some of which are over a hundred years old.This thoughtfulness extends to the studio's crafting of a convincing world where Rocket League is the number one sport. You see it in the multi tier sold out arenas and you hear it from the indistinct chants of allegiance from the fans. The crowd goes 'Oooohhhh!' or 'Aaaaahh!' whether it's a goal or a key ball hit at midfield. These sprinkles of realism aren't strictly necessary but are greatly appreciated for instance the pitch itself features blades of grass that all move independently. These manicured fields are best admired during the pre match camera shots but you can't be faulted for staring at them in the middle of a game. They are complemented by the myriad customization parts from wildly swinging antenna flags to neon blue engine exhaust trails.The joy of Rocket League rests on the countless plans that are conceived and discarded every other second in any given match. Trying to predict where and how the ball will bounce next is a game within the game. Despite the use of cars Rocket League emulates the emotional surges typical of The Beautiful Game such as the rush of an unexpected fast break or a well timed header into a goal. With Rocket League the promising concept of combining two wonderful things cars and soccer is equally magnificent in execution. You can't say the same thing about say combining cake and fruit to make fruitcake as the comedian Jim Gaffigan observed.",Rocket League®

2017-12-29,0,0,1100,False,Recommended,"Rocket League on the surface is a simple concept but look under the hood and you will find some truly amazing examples of game design. The game can appeal to all players of all ages. Driving a rocket powered car around to hit the ball can be fun and relaxing for a young player or a non serious player but taking the time and effort to do training packs and begin to understand the mechanics is exhilerating and rewarding. The level of complexity this game exhibits is truly amazing considering the simple premise upon which it is based. The skill ceiling is incredibly high yet Rocket League manages to make the game fun and intense the whole way up. Oh and did I forget to say that Rocket League is in my opinion the most e sports ready game despite still having a growing player base. I really have nothing bad to say about the game. The loot crate system is completey cosmetic aside from some cars that are reskins of base game cars and even the DLC cars are nothing special compared to the starter car the ""Octane"". Although this is great that the starting car is ""the best"" I would like to see some variance in ""viable"" competitive cars in the future.

2017-10-21,0,0,1554,False,Recommended,Rocket League began for me as some random new free game to try out on Playstation Plus. From day one I loved this game (despite servergate). Little did I know what was to come. Through the following years I would love this game and hate this game. I would rage and I would squeel from excitement. Multiple times I claimed I was done but I always came back. The physics are though to learn but if you're patient and remeber to always HAVE FUN you will love this game. Sure the player base can be very toxic seemingly all the time just like every other online game but the few well behaved players you'll find can make up for it all. Rocket League is on my top 5 favorite games of all time and It's taught me so much about gaming and the point of it all. If you do not have Rocket League in your library that is a huge mistake. Just remember to ignore toxicity and play the game for you. Good luck Have fun!!,Rocket League®

2018-11-24,0,0,110,False,Recommended,Rocket league is a very thrilling at arcade style game whose objective is to basically play football with rocket powered colourful cars. The idea is very unique and is well implemented. Psyonix has done a great job in transforming a great idea to something truly amazing. The game is best played with friends and with the added cross platform support over all consoles it makes this game even better. The variety of modes like hoops and rumble are refreshing but the classic mode steals the show. 1v1 duel involves pure skill while other 2v2 3v3 and 4v4 require strategic planning and teamplaybut still manages to be a ton of fun. The game is quite approachable to new players and has a skill ceiling high enough to involve competitive players and eSports. I have a ton of fun playing this game and it is an amazing experience which anyone should must try. There is a lot of in game cosmetic and trading in the game which I got pretty hooked up to. The only issue I have encountered so far are the servers in this game which has connectivity issues even though having a good enough internet connection. But none of this ruins my experience of playing the game. Also the gaming community is pretty friendly and cooperative which is again a plus. To wrap this up Psyonix has done a brilliant job in transforming the simple idea of cars playing football to something wonderful and the community is still growing after 3 years and we are still getting new updates in the game. With such growing support there is never been a better time to pick this game up and have lots of fun.,Rocket League®

2017-10-02,0,0,987,False,Recommended,There are many addictive and time sinking multiplayer games but few are as fun to play and satisfying as Rocket League.The general theme of car soccer may seem weird and immaturish to many at first glance but upon dwelling deeper into the game you will find a depth of gameplay that is awesome and scary at the same time. The game allows an immense amount of freedom to car control and ball interaction so much that you will spend hours upon hours trying to get better at it . https //www.youtube.com/watch?v wXEp6vEL4pE With intuitive controls and short match lengths (avg. 5mins) the game provides an easy environment for begineers to master the basics. Those basics become the foundation on which you improve your individual skill and advanced gameplay methods through constant practice self learning and analysis. It is a strangely appealing and satisfying feeling when you can notice your own improvements.Even after thousands of matches and many many goals the feeling of zipping through the air and slamming the ball into the goal or flying backwards to stop the ball from going into yours brings joy and happiness. This game will make you feel like a flying god raining judgment upon goal posts.Apart from the standard competitive and casual modes the game also features fun modes like experimental arenas hockey basketball powerup and a dedicated trainer with support included for community made training modules. Rocket League is a testimony to the strength of gameplay design and its one of the most fun multiplayer games in history.,Rocket League®

2016-11-23,0,0,645,False,Recommended,I love this game but will you?So many things have changed since release. There is rocket pass now and crates are quite a big part of getting items to customize your car which require payment to open. You can open them for free however with decryptors or keys from the rocket pass but there is still that element of luck (which i dont have unfortunately). I personally think that this is the only thing that could potentially push new or old players away from this game.Other than that the gameplay is fantastic smooth fast paced and I have not encountered any bugs so far. Its a well designed game with lots of fun alone or with friends.ps. I do pay to open crates becuase I adore this game so much &lt 3,Rocket League®

2016-11-06,0,0,940,False,Recommended,I picked this gem up shortly after release. I had no idea there was a predecessor on Playstation 3 Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket Powered Battle Cars. This game is absolutely ridiculous. So ridiculous it has caused me to neglect many other games I have impulsively picked up during Steam sales. This game has been such a problem that I have put in over whopping 400 hours. That is just nuts over 16 days of gaming. In all honesty I love this game. All the various cars you can choose from and all the many possible customization options are dope. This review is way late and the latest update is the Aquadome and crate system. All just awesome. My only gripe is the fact I do not like that the crate keys are about a buck a piece and that you can often get repeat items out of the crates. If there are just a small group of people to play with trading becomes hard and crates build up due to the fact I cannot justify spending money constantly to open items that I will most likely already have. In my honest opinion I believe each key should be about 25 cents with a minimum four pack being a dollar. Just pick it up and play. It is fun. I currently game with an XBone One Elite Controller and use two paddles on the back for ball view and drifting/sliding. Pretty rad.,Rocket League®
2018-10-16,1,1,229,False,Recommended,I've recently taken a more serious liking to Rocket League but sometimes it makes me not want to play (rank) due to some game flaws that may or may not be able to be fixed. My biggest issue is Teams vs Randoms I hate getting matched with random guys with random skills and 0 communication and getting slaughter by wack teams. I'm barely moving when I do win vs other randoms but losing to a team and getting demoted a division because of it feels like a punch in the face everytime it happens and if I somehow manage to beat them I don't get extra xp or anything (there isn't any sense of accomplishment). Next is AFK or DC's and rank when it happens and you clearly don't have extreme car control you are doomed and whomever you are against is getting free ranks. you don't get a replacement player you have to deal with the 2v3 or worst 1v3 and still get demoted or drop division for losing. I don't know what they can do about the AFK/DC stuff but it would be real cool if they could force teams to face other teams or premade groups and let us randoms struggle amongst ourselves. I still like the game I just get frustrated with a few things.,Rocket League®

2018-05-30,0,0,631,False,Recommended,At the beggining it may seem silly but once you get into competitive play and start watching pros and all kinds of sick plays you will truly see the potential of the game and how competitive it is in high ranks. On video lots of stuff like freestyle air dribbles dribbles ceiling shots do not seem so complicated but when you will try to execute all of those you will realise how much skill it takes. The fact is that everything will come with tons of practice and playing the game and when you will get to land a crazy shot it's going to feel great realising that every moment of practice was worth it. For me Rocket League is the one of the best examples of what E Sports really is and how it should be seen by every person not just a simple video game.,Rocket League®

It MIGHT not be so bad if you can break down the stuff you don't want but nope it's not tradable. They are slowly turning into PUBG by not giving a crap bout the servers and only adding cash items to the game.

I was surprised with the amount of fun I had when I first played Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket Powered Battle Cars on PSN some years ago and Rocket League improves on pretty much everything and it's even better. (plz add metal slug tank on this game lulz.) +Tons of different cars to choose from. (plus there is a lot of DLCs that add even more to it.)+Tons of maps with different themes. +The devs are always updating the game adding more stuff into it and changing some mechanics. +The progression system is waaaay better now. +The performance is ok on low spec PC's. +The report system actually works. +Workshop.+the soundtrack is dope. Matchmaking its a joke. Playing online its fun when you're not on that ""lost package"" thing. the community is horrible as every other online game.

A lot of different mechanics that takes a lot of time to master (not that I have). So if you are looking for a game that you can play and see improvement over time this is the one. People are right.. the community can be extremely toxic but don't forget about the people you play with that aren't (and there are a good amount of them). You have to get used to teammates forfeiting after one goal and randomly leaving the game when you are down by 2 with 3 minutes left.

2018-12-28,0,0,117,False,Recommended,Amazing game! 5/7,Rocket League®
2018-04-14,0,0,902,False,Recommended,This game is amazing. I'm hooked to it. The graphics are really good the developers care for the game so useful and good updates are quite frequent in comparison to some games. The game is great as it also has a competitive game mode which can be fun to grind. There are also various game modes you can play that are fun too! You can also play with friends both competitively and casually. The trading system is great and the cosmetic items make the game stand a bit out but this game like many is not perfect.With almost 600 hours at this game I have to say I have met my fair deal of dissapointing and annoying moments. For example the community is not great. In comparison to some games it is alright but overall not something that I can say is good. People are toxic especially in competitive and use different annoying ways to make your experience less fun. There is a good 15% chance you will meet these types of people and if you do then I feel sorry for you as they completely ruin a match experience. There are also quite a few scammers in the trading community but with lots of trading experience this can easily be avoided if you have an IQ that is higher than 30. And finally the servers. I need to stress that the servers are quite bad. Firstly if you live in the middle of the USA chances are you will get a lot of lag as there are NO US Central servers. Secondly the odd 'bad' server in the game because the servers are sometimes poor makes playing the game seriously more difficult and less fun. Finally these slightly goes against my point about useful updates but the game developers of RL Psyonix release crates with cosmetics for your cars TOO OFTEN instead they could add more game modes or updates to fix the issues mentioned above! This game also suffers from repetetitivity so if you get depressed from doing the same thing I don't recommend this game.Even though I wrote more disadvantages than advantages I still love this game. With the toxic community scammers and bad servers the game has much more to give than make you hate it. Please if you like football/soccar cars and games that aren't P2W I seriously recommend trying this game out. Preferbly when its on a dsicounted offer you will save a bit of your money.Please thumbs up my review it helps me out!Thanks for reading this far!Delta...,Rocket League®

EDIT i used to get up to rising star rewards and just as i thought of coming back to the game i realized it doesnt give season rewards for placing...so im stuck with a bronze dragon not platnium..thats t to make you have to win game for season rewards that i placed high enough for. its a shame to have to leave but not getting the dragon for placing plat was my last straw. farewell rocket league many of hours i dont regret...sad to see them go this way.,Rocket League®

2018-08-22,0,0,20,False,Recommended,"A really good game to pass the time. I've always played casually and its matchmaking is almost perfect in the sense that it matches you with people who are (roughly) on your level. That way you don't feel overwhelmed during your ""noob"" period. Psyonix has also been adding tons of new content for free since the game came out. There is usually a tournament or a championship going on if you're serious about the game.There are also microtransactions and DLCs but every single one of them is purely cosmetic. There is absolutely no pay to win here.The servers are quite good. I've never had serious lag and even if you have lag it usually goes away quickly.I've always played the game with an Xbox controller and it feels very natural and you get used to the controls very easily. I can't say how smooth the gameplay is with a keyboard and mouse though.All in all an awesome game that is as casual or hardcore as you want it to be. Definitely recommended!",Rocket League®

2017-11-27,0,0,1830,False,Recommended,Rocket League is an awesome game that many don't know until they try it. It is very competitive and still remains fun to play. You spend the first few hundred hours managing your steering on the ground. Then you start hitting the ball while flying through the air. Then you go back to trying to master the ground more by using fakes and juggles to your advantage. This is the type of game that doesn't take long to learn how to play but takes a lifetime to master it. Personally I'm not really into sport type games but I think I can honestly say that this game hits the nail in between the sports and pure arcade fun. I'd even pay full price if I had to get it again as it is totally worth it. ),Rocket League®

Una guida per Rocket LeagueDi BashThis Guide is part of my Steam Review for the game however fear not you will find a lot of information in here.

Many eSports such as League of Legends and DOTA 2 are free to play and Rocket League could become way more popular and grow a much more rich community if it goes free to play. Also fIX yOuR seRVeRs pSYoNIx. I've had the disconnect triangle more times than I could count and when I go back to the game I'm already kicked for being idle and can't play for a specific amount of time. One last thing there should be moderators for Psyonix. Similar to Discord or Subreddit Moderators mods should be able to view reports on other players and see if they should punish them or not because the community is ing .

2017-11-22,0,0,1636,False,Recommended,Rocket League is a bit like marmite You either love it or hate it.A good time waster and fun to play with friends but be aware The community is VERY toxic. Often team mates will turn against each other if a mistake is made be it a bad pass miss or even an unlucky own goal. It s even worse in ranked matches as a lot of people take it for a lot more than it actually is (a game) leading to an onslaught of abuse through the text chat system and numerous reports of complaints against users just because the option is there.Personally I enjoy the game but I usually only play with friends and hardly ever on my own. Sometimes you encounter players that are far more skilled than you (of which you will have no chance) and this is down to the flaws in the matchmaking. It s not simply pairing you with better players to increase your skill as quite often you will be faced against people with over 2000 hours in game (I have around 300 hours at time of writing).Overall its a great game to play with friends and a lot of fun. It s difficult to resist buying keys to open crates (for which you gain additional customisation items that are purely cosmetic). Just try to ignore the toxic community.,Rocket League®
2018-11-08,0,0,13,False,Not Recommended,This review is for KBM players and not controller players This is a Great game thats very enjoyable but the PC controls are a mess and they have no sense of urgency to make the KBM controls much better So If you like using a Mouse to Steer or to pitch in the air than this game some how ruined what other PC games have mastered with precision driving and pilot steering Most of your vehicle control will be from your keyboard and it will be based off press holding time for how quickly you accelerate pitching or steering which is controllable in settings but never feels like the free range movement you get from a joystick The mouse control is too stiff and acts more like Left to right button instead of raw free movement. I have heard babies on these fourms say some games just play better on a controller But this is only beacuse the devs wont make rocket league have 100% mouse steering control and they added crazy acceleration and deadzone resets to a mouse which is 100% dumb Besides my rant it is worth the buy if you prefer controllers or dealing with keyboard controls w/out mouse steering I assume a small precentage complained about it which makes sense since most players i know prefer controllers and there population is mostly console.,Rocket League®

It makes the movements easier and the vehicles easier to control within the environment The customization is superb with more items that can be used to customize your vehicle earned through each match and The selection of game modes is a reflection of all that can be done in the game! Not to mention the steam workshop games that can be downloaded as well )The bad My only real complaint is that connections can sometimes be shoddy (#servergate) however that is a fact with most online oriented gameplay (that I've experienced anyways). As well the online matches can be unbalanced at times whether in your favour or against. You always have to be on your A game (which is what I like personally).Overall This game is definitely worth its weight in gold! I enjoy every minute of gameplay (even if I'm pounding my fists on my desk in frustration... ) Its comuppances outweigh the shortfalls by a longshot and the game is definitely worth playing even if that's just with a friend or competitively.,Rocket League®

There's using your boost to propel you into the air rather than to speed up into the ball. On top of all that it's a team based game.

2018-12-10,0,0,24,False,Recommended,"I wish I could review neutral. Though Rocket league is fun and hard to learn at first. I can see myself enjoying it. However my issue has become with toxicity. This may be a childish complaint but I feel the community makes the game. And with that said when the people you are playing against do nothing but spit at you and insult you and not just around and place nice but instead play like its life or death then proceed to spam you with ""Great job!"" when they score on you. That just ruins the mood. Its hard to have fun when playing against people you dont know when those people are complete assh*les. Again its hard to learn and fun to play. If you are new you are going to be insulted by complete c*nts. The same applies if you are experianced. If you arent playing competitivly and just trying to enjoy the game for what it is. You will be insulted for everything you do. Then again I havent played this game recently in defense. And I only have 24 hours. But I still feel thats enough to know the community. Most my matches when I still played were full of people being rude c*nts and really sweating their off to win even though its just a casual match. I think people who act like this ruin games. When they have to go to casual to inflate their ego. Its pathetic. Aside from the community this game has lootboxes and car DLC something I was 100% unaware of when I bought it. most this stuff is cosmetic and doesnt change things one bit. I think the cars may change some things. but thats it. You can put hats on your car more stuff like that.I havent played in so long all I have to say is all and all.

I cannot recall an issue with networking or gameplay 2 or more years ago. It seems that the devs are more concerned with how much trash content they can put in a rocket pass or crates to make us spend dollars and cents when they don't re invest the profits into improving servers and general quality improvements. In the last week I have had to uninstall my game try 3 different network solutions and nothing has worked. I cannot play more than 2 minutes without my game crashing. Honestly this game is fun it truly is. Solo or with friends. But how is it fun when I cannot even play it anymore? Step it up Psyonix I have lost my faith.,Rocket League®

The skill cap is practically infinite there are many different game modes to keep you interested and overall its one of the best games out there right now. The only issue is the servers as the U.S. West one's can be questionable to say the least and there isn't U.S. Central servers.

2018-09-18,0,0,1016,False,Not Recommended,A shining example of a small studio with a sleeper hit going the big boys path to money grabbing by all means necessary. It is a shame that in a few decades the gaming industry went from free skins to micro transactions to changing money for the possibility to give you the thing that you want. It is only visual may apply for the most decals rims and so on but they are aimed at making you pay in order to also have such nice goal explosion animated body paint flashy rims etc. Then we have all the new cars which look and feel different. Whit Psyonix not bothering to show any actual hit boxes or official stats only blind trust holds their statement of not selling power .The new season pass creates a nice new twist. You buy a pass and they have to play matches in order to unlock items from the season s item list. Therefore you ought to both pay and play hours in order to obtain the locked items. At least you know beforehand which items to expect. However if you do not buy the pass you can still play hours and unlock something. Yes this something is among the most boring uninspired items nobody would care/pay for if there were micro transactions.On a technical note the servers in Europe (Sept 2018) are ok. There are occasional WTF moments when the you could sworn you are about to hit the ball only to see it fly by or to pause midair in a momentary physics/server panic or to have lag spikes and Saudi players with three digit pings in competitive games but this is Rocket League. Forget matchmaking issues. The server issues persist through the years but that is ok. We are here to sell loot boxes and do cross platform marketing. Come buy the new Hot Wheels DLC!,Rocket League®

2019-02-10,0,0,641,False,Recommended,At a first glance this game seems to promote all men's fantasies while they sculpt their best shape of a couch potato. We're dealing with a football game starring big good looking vehicles and in which the best way to boast is car tuning. Let's not mention the fact that this testosteroned environment like the Call of Duty franchise is fulfilled with 12 15 years old players wanting to show that they don't need a driving license to be cool.But when you set this aside and fully play the game for what it is and not what it looks like you find a balanced competitive and entertaining action game. You will need lots and lots of playtime maybe some practice and trial and error sessions if you want to improve but in the end the more you play the more you enjoy the game. You come for the entertainment and you stay to master the tool between your hands.The competitive modes are in my opinion the soul of the game. The rank system gives a lot of motivation to climb without any upper rank seeming out of reach. With the casual modes only I don't think I would have trained and played this game that much far from it.Don't play this game if you know you're a tryharder and do not have that much time to play.Don't play this game if you expect to make ceiling shots with a keyboard and a mouse.Otherwise don't even think twice before putting that game in your cart.

2019-02-12,0,0,65,False,Not Recommended,First of all this is one of those games you can just jump in and enjoy. It's unique the physics are wonky but predictable and the entire game play experience is great. If you wanted to hear the good then stop reading here because crap takes a turn for the worse in this game quickly.That being said the actual players make this game almost unplayable. Hop in a random match with cross platform play enabled and you get stuck with a team of PS4 players who can't play the game you lose miserably and learn nothing as you scramble to fix their mistakes. PS4 players get the game free with their PS membership so you have a lot of new players all the time hopping on and the teams are horrible when cross platform play is enabled. Hop in a game without cross platform play and you find groups of players who would rather trash talk then play the game let alone help your team. Just today I watched a team mate finish a goal and then watched another team mate refuse to play the rest of the match while continuously trash talking both me and his other team mate. It's hard to want to play a game where that's common and it's common. Hop on competitive first error a team mate or yourself make and you can watch at least one team mate leave the game immediately.Too be clear I want to love this game. I like sports games. I like racing games. I like PvP but Rocket League is broken. I know they're trying to fix it. I know they put bans in place and they brag about their automatic ban system but the community is still the community and it's horrible. It's worse than CS GO and that takes a lot of effort from a large group of players to be that bad.,Rocket League®

2019-02-13,0,0,1155,False,Recommended,This short review is written exactly one year since I bought this game.Well Rocket League is addictive fun and a game which is easy to learn but hard to master.The first amazing thing of this game is it is a hybrid game the combination of football (and basketball hockey etc) with cars. If you are looking for sports game but getting bored of casual football or basketball games then you should give Rocket League a try you probably will like it. This game is all about skill and teamwork other things won't affect your win (except your network of course)The second one is the customization there are tons of items for your car and millions combination that you can try (but you know most items can only be obtained by getting random drops or opening the crates with key that you need to buy or by trading with other players. However you don't need to have those expensive items to be the best in this game. You can play with standard Octane that you got from the beginning and become the Grand Champ if you got what it takes.The third one is the community I know that you will find so many different people in this game trash talker noob ball chaser but still there are still good people. I did find some of them and they showed me how to get better in this game. Other than that custom training is there for you created by the community of Rocket League.However most people say that the server is suck but i don't agree 100% with them. Most of the time i played smoothly no problem. But it doesn't mean i never encountered any problem during online play. Well the server is not perfect but it's not that bad. I still got ping spikes in some server but most servers are good. So basically you need to double check your connection first before blaming Psyonix for the server. Overall this game is a must try for you guys. I'm going to give 8.8/10 for this game. I got addicted to be honest. I've been spending more than 900 hours in this game so you could tell how much i love to play this one.,Rocket League®

2017-12-28,1,2,29,False,Recommended,To be fair you have to have a very high IQ to play Rocket League. The gameplay is extremely subtle and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the gameplay will go over a typical viewer s head. There s also Rocket League s advanced scoring system which might seem very simplistic at an initial glance. Those who do not partake in the exhilarating gameplay that we call Rocket League can only imagine it as RC cars playing with an ordinary tennis ball. The fans understand the challenging gameplay they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of physics to realize that they re not just fun and games they say something deep about its functionality. As a consequence people who dislike Rocket League truly ARE idiots of course they wouldn t appreciate for instance the detail of animation which itself is a cryptic reference to Bernhard Riemann's complex analysis through Riemann surfaces. I m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Psyonix s genius wit unfolds itself on their computer monitors. What fools.. how I pity them. And yes by the way i DO have a Rocket League tattoo. And no you cannot see it. It s for the ladies eyes only and even then they have to demonstrate that they re within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid,Rocket League®

I must say that I usually don't like online multiplayer based games they're usually laggy filled with brats and generally not fun to play (take this with a grain of salt though since I am essentially playing on a potato).Rocket Leauge is different though.While yes the game is designed to be played online it doesn't seem like you're online all of the time.The soundtrack is great not my kind of music but it could be worse.The visuals are great! And I'm not talking about the high quality graphics either I have to play on performance so my game runs better but even then they are better than most games that I have seen anywhere else.The gameplay is something else. the controls are great even though I don't have a controller and it's easy to pick up the basics. Once you got the controls down anything can happen.If I have one complaint about this game it's that the matchmaking isn't the best. My ""rank"" is 20 semi pro but I'm still only a beginner and I get pitted against pros in which my team always loses. Also I feel like I keep on facing against bots because 3 people with the same username appear on the opposing team and kick the crap out of me.In the end however I belive that everyone should play Rocket Leauge so if you don't have it buy it.

2017-08-01,0,0,185,False,Recommended,Don't let this game's intense learning curb intimidate you because I made that mistake in the past when I first played this alone on PS4. Rocket League is a game you have to put alot of time and effort into to get good at in order to truely enjoy it for what it is. This isn't a game where you can just pick it up and immediately be good at. Already clocking in 6 hours of game time in this game within the 3 days I've owned it Rocket League is a very enjoyable game of what can really just be best described as car soccer or Soccar as the game calls it. There are multiple modes like standard soccar rumble mode where you have weapons like in Mario Kart a basketball mode and a hockey mode as well as a few other modes (but to be honest I've really only played standard and rumble) that add variety to the gameplay though really you could burn countless hours just in standard mode alone and not even realize it! The plethora of car customizations accessories explosions for when you get a goal boosts trails and so much more also add to the high octane fun of Rocket League.With that said the game isn't perfect just as this review is only somewhat coherent since I haven't experienced all there is to the game yet. The AI is kinda trash at times scoring on their own goals or just sitting there doing nothing like an actual player gone AFK or with a garbage connection. The machmaking is also quiet unbalanced in terms of pitting players against other players with the same skill rank as them. 2 semi pros vs. 2 masters is not a fair match up Psyonix! The matchmaking also at times bugged for us where my group at times would sit in an empty lobby waiting for a match that would never come but that may of been on the end of the person hosting the game as it worked fine when I hosted it so can't really fault Psyonix on that since that is just speculation. Finally the music for Rocket League isn't that good mostly just geneic house produced dubstep but at least it fills the dead air of waiting for matches and being in the main menu so it does it's job at the very least.Rocket League was something I made unfair judgement towards in the past. Faulting the game for being very newbie unfriendly having revisited this again with friends on Steam recently has changed my tone towards it quiet a bit. It's one of those games where you can't let your initial skill at it effect your entire opinion on the game. By yourself it isn't very much of an enjoyable experience in my opinion since a major key of success in Rocket League is good communication so if you've got a group of friends especially one who is very much experienced with the game I definetely recommend picking this up. I can ensure you that yes you are gonna screw up you are gonna play people who are blantantly better than you and you are gonna rage quit but at the same time you are gonna improve upon your mistake and get better in time.,Rocket League®
2015-10-29,0,0,22,False,Recommended,Man this is just a fun game plain and simple It's Soccer/Football with R/C Cars there is a cross platforming ability so PC and Playstation can play together or against each other or you can turn it off if you want. The game is beautiful the music is fun the only real downside to it is when playing the game like an actual match there is no music the matches are short only five minutes so its not a time sink and the solo season is fun the A.I could use a bit more I but hey its whatever. I don't usually say a game is worth it's full price but at $20 this game is great for the price or any discount. It has had multiple updates since release all of which have made it look sund and run so much better I don't see being able to play without a controller but I know some people do it and are really good other than that I love this game 10/10,Rocket League®

2017-01-18,0,0,466,False,Recommended,So I have at the time of this review spent more than 170 hours on the game. First impressions were that it was pretty good. As I continued to play it I soon realised that the game was alot more than just football with cars. The game features a wide variety of cars items like hats flags wheels and even boost trails. If you were to try to combine all of these items excluding the DLC items you would get up into the billions of combinations the game features. On top of this the Devs have added a total of 4 arenas into the game which have all featured DLC cars that fit the theme of the map the maps however have all been free for everyone. Over all a very good game that you could sink hours into even though the matches are only about 5 minutes long (6 Including the Score cams and such.) And i guess this is where my review ends because i suck at reviewing stuff so yeah. Good game very addicting especially with friends and it's well worth your money.Edit A lot of people usually complain that this game has a cancerous community while this is true there is an easy way of preventing talk.

2016-02-08,0,0,1091,False,Recommended,"This is one of the games that should be in everyone's Steam libraries. Here's why It's extremely intuitive and easy to learn (not to master though) There's TONS of room for mastery and skill after 120+ hours I can attest that I have much to learn You learn the game simply by playing it. No ""build guides"" or extended studying needed (I'm looking at you MOBAs). Tons of replay value. I have friends who have almost 1000 hours on it and have stopped playing other games. It can be played in short intensely fun bursts. Most matches are around 7 10 minutes. It works perfectly out of the box reliable/fast dedicated servers 1 4 local co op (works flawlessly) 21 9 ultrawide support... It's fun for complete beginners (everyone so bad as beginners that it's hilarious and exhilirating when you happen to hit a goal in) It's equal parts casual and competitive. Casual matches can be joined and left with no penalty (which I personally enjoy). Ranked matches are fun and intense. The community is pretty great. Most people are fun and friendly mainly because the nature of the game lends itself towards good hearted fun. This is the only game alongside Witcher 3 in my library of 1300+ games that I rate a 10/10.",Rocket League®

Lovely to see my friends get banned for being toxic (be it he was...) but there are people who get to spam that ""What a save!"" or mindlessly talk trash in casuals with nothing really being done about it.They need to add a sort of ""Overwatch"" system like CS GO had creates more videos for youtubers more publicity more people playing the game also means we can actually have some friendly games for once? Or maybe ""undercover mods"" who just join random games to play and if they see toxic behaviour ban 8)Why dont I recommend this game?Mainly the community.They keep the game updated with repeated (just revamped old) special events that make the game slightly more enjoyable for a while more. But after 1000hrs of gametime/afktime/trading/whatever I was doing from a baddddd laptop to a PC this game is just boring now.I have no incentive to want to win or to get a high rank. I've seen people in high diamond struggle to rotate or hit the ball even remotely well. Be it we all have bad days why do some of us get put with those people... over... and over? Or trying to grind solos in duos and making great progress with really good games then being put with 4 people that are completely clueless and you get de_stroyed. If you come onto this game to mess around with some friends then you'll probably enjoy it. But to really try and grind this game unless you have one teammate you can click with and work really well with arguments will be started anger will arise and you probably wont have a great time.

Competitive players also get ranked gamemode for people to grind! The game's colorfully absurd cars playing sports concept works so well because the energy of its arcadey gameplay meshes with its deep team based strategy and variety of modes. It s also exceedingly rare to find a multiplayer game that s welcoming and approachable for new players and so intricate that the best players can earn a living by mastering its depths. Rocket League is a golden example of turning a good idea into something truly amazing. Perfect soundtracks composed by artists from Monstercat and other groups so just put your headphones on and enjoy. I really recommend this game.,Rocket League®

Whenever I want to play it I play a few matches. Some go hard core in this game but I don't. Its a nice game to play if you don't have a lot of time to play because it does not beg you to keep going.

2017-01-17,0,0,929,False,Recommended,Rocket League is a very addictive game. I Regularly find myself saying 'One more game' 20 times in a row. I would certainly not say that's a bad thing. With it's high speed gaming and Steep learning curve it may not be for the slower of us but this game has a *Mostly* welcoming community many of which will help new players. Although sometimes frustrating (Im talking about the goalpost physics of course) this game is very well made rarely dropping below 60 Frames Per Second at any time on any map. However i regularly hear of people complaining about the map 'Aquadome' and it's eyecandy causing lag this has never affected me.Stunning graphics and physics that feel very real Excluding the flying jumping and flipping cars obviously make Rocket League a lovely experience. As well as this cross platform play allows you to play with your console friends in private matches although i would love to see a cross platform trading and parties that allow you to seemlessly play with your buddies no matter the platform.Would highly recommend this game to anyone!,Rocket League®

There are a few game modes from 1v1 duels to 4v4 ""chaos"" games where everyone scramble for the ball.

2015-12-19,0,0,161,False,Recommended,This is that game that you just can't get off of. This is the one game that you love. Once you see this you throw your call of duty in the garbage. You delete Minecraft. you de install every other game and you buy this game. Why? Because you do.I say this for this game is like no other. It isn't your classical and fun fifa styled game. All though to the common eye it is soccer which it is. If you were to compare this game to fifa all fifa games would go to trash. Why? Cause of the amazing feel of the game.You are a car that is for no good freaking reason fighting to the death playing soccer. Yeah no freaking point what so ever. But you don't care about the point. You care about the gameplay.You know of MLG PRO! Well that is the definition of this game. You can do so many fun things that will suck days and days out of your life and you won't care. I have played 42 hours of this game (as of when I made this review) and it rises by the day. This game is a no brainer to be the best steam game I have ever played. Coming from my mouth that means a lot.You can fly kick people's freaking butts for the fun of it blow people up XD and so much more. Why? Because you freaking do. No reason but you do it cause you just do. You just waste 20 dollars on a game and play your eyes out. you forget about the party you will attend. You play at 3 00 am. You just do that. Why? Because you literally just fell in love with a game. Not kidding. in conclusion this game is a must have. If you don't have it you are missing out on so much.

2016-09-09,0,0,322,False,Recommended,With the new Runble update I feel obligated to recommend this (not that it wasn't great before the update). Amazingly fun game with great devs that keep updating the game and adding free new modes maps and a lot of features community asked for.I don't understand why people would complain about new 'CSGO like' crate system. I support the idea since it's just cosmetical stuff that doesn't affect the game and IMO it's a good way to continually found the game and eSport scene. Keep in mind that this is probably best played with a controller but I use keyboard and I don't feel like I'm in a big disadvantage. Other than that I have nothing bad to say about this game.Edit just for the Steam event the game is still great.,Rocket League®

2018-06-19,2,2,103,False,Not Recommended,"First of all Rocket League is really fun. Repetitive and lacking in variety definitely but the core gameplay follows the ""easy to learn hard to master"" play pattern so well that it doesn't get boring as you gradually learn new cool tricks and face more challenging opponents.So why the negative review? Because this is barely even a game at this point. With every update Rocket League is getting closer to being nothing but a digital cash cow. It's not a free to play game yet it has a bunch of DLC and additionally there's a terrible lootbox system here as well. And now they have added a premium pass. All of this shows how disrespectful the developers are of their community. On top of that the game's maintenance leaves a lot to be desired with serious issues being left unattended for weeks if not months. And no new content is ever added these days except more cosmetic items hidden behind paywalls and only accessible via an in game lottery.I simply cannot recommend giving the developers of this game your money they will only go out of their way to get more of it. When these unfair business strategies are dropped I will gladly recommend this really fun game to everyone until then buy it only if you're willing to spend massive amounts of money or accept severe limitations because you don't.",Rocket League®

Like ""Even though everything is going to **** at least I have Rocket League"" fun. However in good conscience I can't recommend this game anymore. I'm looking at you toxic community bad servers and loot boxes. The focus of Psyonix is now clearly on making money rather than polishing their game so the players of all the world can enjoy it to its full potential. The servers are now worst than ever and it seem to get worst with each update. Lag and high ping are now a daily thing. And what have they done to correct this? They implemented a premium pass (or whatever it's called) to make even more money instead of fixing what's essential to the game.

For every match played you are guaranteed a new customization item for your garage. (Boost Paint Job Topper Antenna Banner). After you acquire all the items you have a chance to obtain crates which contain even more items!The Developers of this game (Psyonix Studios) is one of the more engaging teams compared to other games. From what I have seen over the past years Psyonix is able to please the communities demands. On their website about every two weeks or so there is updates from them and they also use a twitter account (Which they constantly update on!)If you are starting the game fresh I recommend maybe finding a friend or 2 (3v3s) to learn the controls and mechanics together. I started with a teammate i knew to play 2v2 together. It is very fun with friends.As you start from the bronze ranks (The lowest rank) you will see many players also aiming to improve their skills. Each rank seems to have a different level of gameplay to them.I would say going through each of the ranks (Champion 3 peaked) you can really start to see the level of communication to succeed. Especially in the diamond/champion ranks here is where things really start to get competitive! This is what overall makes this game the perfect e sports game the concept that the skill level is so high for this game. It is never too long before someone picks up on a new mechanic.

When playing offline movement is largely based on reality and is fairly consistant but online play is like jerking off in wonderland. The combination of the cheapest servers money can buy half cross platofrm patchwork and the varying bubbles around cars makes the game unplayable. There are huge discrepencies between what a player sees on their client and waht the server interprets as happening I imagine this is due to psyonics choosing a 5 10 tick format of packet sending data to the server what a buch of money grubbing cucks. The nice people of psyonics also believe that skins will make us forget about all of these game breaking bugs but they need to pull head from and start fixing what theyve broken. The highschool dropout that coded this game deserves all the best but the company he works for should be condemned to creating only crap free games for mobile devices.

2018-10-03,0,0,1416,False,Not Recommended,A very interesting game that challenges you to master control of these vehicles. I've played this game for years and I've had a great time thanks to the few wonderful friends I get to enjoy it with. I can no longer recommend this game though because over the years the game developers have been riding their microtransaction content to make money off it's most loyal and loving customers only to ing cuck them with the chance of getting a decent cosmetic item. The only content I've seen released over the past couple years are more crates and some semi decent to game modes. If you're a competitive person and want to get into the games ranked system and climb the leaderboards be sure to play with some grand champion friends because more than half the players in platinum rank just started playing the game and sit under the ball when it's over the enemy goal. The competitive match making system in this game is one of the worst I've experienced in any game. It's so easily manipulated that the only way you can guarantee your team mates are the rank they should be is to actually be friends with them and play with them consistently. I loved this game years ago all the way up until they started releasing thousands of cosmetic items and some pretty terrible maps that most players don't even want to play. I cannot forsee anything interesting being changed or released in the game in the future. If you like this game as is buy it. If you like certain cosmetic items in this game buy them from players because your chance of getting it from the cuck gambling system is extremely low.,Rocket League®

If you're not planning to to play with friends don't expect it to be fun. But this leads me to the next piece of The likelihood of you in a team of 3 being a ing prick is way to high. The player base and Psyonix's both unwillingness and incompetence to properly deal with their toxic players is another piece of the big t picture. And it could be simple to fix things. But they're not even trying. They could limit the time for players and teams to watch instant review of goals. But they don't. Some people are really getting off of that stuff and that's just what you still have to deal with when you disable all chats. Which is your best option but evidently won't help you against the rest of the t. And even if people aren't intentional they're ing stupid. Even in high tier competitive matches you have ing morons who are too stupid to get the basics of the game.

2018-09-16,0,0,2445,False,Not Recommended,I love this game but I cannot recommend it. The company that created it has fallen victim to it's own greed and is slowly turning the game into a service rather than a product while ignoring broken parts of the game. The in game VOIP hasn't worked for roughly two years. The bots are still pants on head . The matchmaking and smurfing is still a problem. Instead of fixing these things the company adds more cosmetic items and creates a chat and name censoring system without an option to opt out.The company also bans people from playing the game for up to a month for using bad words without an appeal process. Never mind chat bans they flat out steal your game away from you by changing the EULA without informed consent.Stay away from this game and do not trust Psyonix.,Rocket League®
2018-07-03,0,0,108,False,Not Recommended,"tl dr Game good toxic community bad. Fun to play with friends not fun to play soloFirst of all let me say this Rocket League is a very fun game with pretty solid mechanics/coding. I really do enjoy playing this game WITH FRIENDS. Unfortunately the community in public games has surpassed even League of Legends CS GO and other AAA titles in terms of griefing/toxicity. Approximately 30% of my games in COMPTETIVE game modes are ruined by a griefer. Griefing in this game ranges from scoring on their own team afk farming and spamming of quick chats throughout the game and more. Each game is relatively short ( 3 8 minutes) so if you so desire you can just ""deal with"" the griefers. However as you are getting trolled you have to remain active in the game so you don't get kicked for inactivity. A soft ban on queues occurs with increasing length to a potential perma ban with each kick. I don't have the patience to sit through a full game getting trolled and to me if about one in every three games is wasted time the entire game is ruined. Understand i'm not saying that the game itself is poorly designed in any way it's actually VERY well made comes at a modest price and can run on most computers. My issues are as stated the community (some of them some people are also great but in this case the good DOES NOT outweigh the bad) and the game publisher(s) that have not taken action to prevent these players from damaging other player's experience.DISCLAIMER Everything i've stated has come from my personal experience with Rocket League your experience may differ At the time of writing this review i am fluttering between silver/gold ranks. While i was in bronze i experienced MORE griefers. I suspect higher mmr fewer trolls for obvious reasons but cannot speak beyond my own experience",Rocket League®

2015-07-07,0,0,13,False,Recommended,"TLDR This is one of the more unique series' of games that i have played and I wholeheartedly recommend this game. GET IT if you think you are interested. its worth it.Extended review I never would have thought that soccer (or footbal for the rest of the world) would be so fun in cars. Flying through the sky preventing a goal clearing it up the field and shooting is all extremely satisfying. Theres really never a dull moment. youre either excited waiting for the ball to line up for you to drill into the back of the net or freaking out whether or not your opponent will tap the ball in to tie it up right at the end of a game as the ball lazily rolls across your net. I love this game and am extremely stoked that it came out for PC since I dont have a ps4. But this isnt my first experience with this game. There was a prequel.The ""prequel"" was Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket Powered Battle Cars or SARPBC on the ps3. I stumbled upon the demo in the ps3 stor years ago played it a bit and was instantly hooked. I sunk countless hours into the game. The only downside I ever thought of was the fact that it was multiplayer focused with some single play and split screen. By the time i stopped playing the game there were very few people playing online so there were only bots to play against in normal games.Rocket league fixes every issue I had with its predecessor. There is now a season mode where you go up against teams of bots in games. From what time ive put into it so far (7 games out of the 27 or something week season number of games is changable along with teams in season end tournament) it passes the time when Im not in the mood for multiplayer (I have an issue with lag for most online games so i tend to stick to split screen or single player games although lag hasnt been terrible for me). Theyve also further delved deeper into your cars customizatoin from just chasis and decal you now choose chasis wheel decal colors for which team and style of colors hats (yes hats) boost color and antenna. All of these different parts track different stats like goals saves and so on. I participated in the Alpha for this game and I would have recommended the game at that point but then they took it further.So if you want a great multiplayer experience with an extremely fun game this is a must buy.See you on the pitch!",Rocket League®

2018-02-08,3,11,337,False,Not Recommended,Honestly the game is fun but the player base is worse than any you can think of including League of Legends. It doesn't matter what game mode you play the anonymity a player has and the lack of punishment that this game gives has bred probably the worst player base out of any game I've ever experienced playing. The report button is a joke and it's well known by players. Other than that the mechanics take more than a little bit of time to get used to but once you get past just throwing your car at the ball the game becomes a lot of fun. Game is most enjoyable when you have a group of 2 or 3 players. Reccomend to buy only if it's on sale or if it was gifted.Will change review of the game to thumbs up once theres a system of punish implimented for extremely toxic players which it is currently very much lacking.,Rocket League®
2016-05-29,0,0,528,False,Recommended,Product received for free. A combination of RC cars and sports that is surprisingly fun and seemingly simple but with a hidden amount of depth underneath that separates those that want to play casually and the hardcore. Easy to learn difficult to master great game overall.Also the devs continue to support the game by rolling out updates and services that the fans actually want and enjoy including new game modes free of charge. Paid DLC is purely cosmetic no P2W. Cross platform play with both PS4 and Xbox One for increased server counts. Expect this game to have great longevity to it.,Rocket League®

2017-07-06,1,4,84,False,Recommended,Rocket League is an incredible game with tons of replay value. There are several different game modes like Dropshot Rumble Hoops and Hockey and there's also competative modes for 1v1s 2v2s and 3v3s. There are microtransactions for keys to unlock seasonal crates that you occasionally earn as well as a bunch of DLC but the content is all purely aesthetic.Overall it's definitely one of my favorite games to play with friends online and I would highly recommend it to anyone interested in buying it!Also it's decently easy to get every achievement!

I played the game for its gameplay to this day and didn't put much effort on my cars' looks but it seems like they are turning into EA in terms of on players' head. Recently they added an utter t named Rocket Pass which is a complete joke for a PAID game. Rocket Pass is not a special event or else. You play the game You level up in Rocket Pass level (which is not worth it unless you buy the PREMIUM) beside your normal level And items(really really bad and useless ones if not Premium and you get those items every 4 5 levels Premium has every fancy Exotic one can dream of every level). I could accept it if there wasn't a HUGE CLIFF between the premium and the normal but you literally get nothing valuable or beautiful except Ciphers that opens chest but you only get a few of them if you gain all levels in the season. NOTE My problem is not even Rocket Pass even though im completely against it in a PAID Game. My problem is that this is just the BEGINNING of a wrong way that will end in a complete premium game even though it's not free to play.,Rocket League®

Absolutely nothing.

2018-07-06,0,0,8,False,Not Recommended,"A lot of toxic people say that their teammates play even worse than these toxic people. (the only way to play worse than these toxic people is to play against their own team so they are actually lying) Also some teammates intentionally bump into me (even in the beginning of the game) steal goals/boost orbs let only their friends get goals/assists etc. Other than the toxic people brought by the free weekend (they'll leave soon though) the game is really good but there aren't a lot of tutorials. I got Expert/Veteran in another team as Semi Pro though but it's all ok. The only reason I don't recommend it is because the developers are going to remove exp/item gain in singleplayer mode for the purpose of fighting ""farmers"" (they do no harm to the game) make uncommon items gained by leveling up and make the levels infinite. They already have lootboxes too so I guess the devs suddenly thought this isn't a paid game but a REALLY bad and &amp *?%ty f2p one. I mean that they always had these DLC cars that are worth more than the game itself and now they thought it isn't enough. The devs here aren't the only ones who got greedy on paid content for paid games though so they are not the only ones to blame.

2015-08-26,2,5,323,False,Recommended,"Rocket League is somewhat unique and I'm here to be a critique...When you give me a sports game most likely a football game like Pro Evolution Soccer or FIFA I will take it and smack you with it. Not that I hate sports or sport games it's just I kind of don't like it and it's not that much of a fun for me. If you give me an arcade racing game I probably won't smack you but I won't be your best friend either. I do like some of the racing games but It's not exactly something I'm looking for.And then there is Rocket Leaque. A nightmare for anyone like me. Sports racing hybrid. The idea sounds so bad I simply had to have this game. And believe it or not it's probably one of the best game of this (or similar) genre I have played in a VERY long time. Why? Well because it's fun goddammit and that's what counts for me.The point of the game is to score a goal and eventually win. Either in 1v1 2v2 3v3 or 4v4 modes with 2 teams Blue and Orange. Now you're thinking with Battle Cars. Each of the players will have his own Battle Car. That's... a car. With... rocket and... antenna... And a hat. You can't forget a hat. Anyway you can score by hitting the ball into goal (I know I know it's a very shocking game mechanic no one could foresee). It doesn't matter if the ball flies in the air or just sits around eating its hotdog and yelling at you ""Hey! Hit me with your best shot!"". If you DO score enemy players will be angry and teammates will use the very convenient quick chat offering 12 of different chat messages you can use instantly. And then spam ""Sorry! Sorry! Sorry!""All you do the entire game is controlling your Battle Car that offers various different things that may and may not help you in achieving the ultimate 'winner status'. The car obviously has four wheels so you can move into any direction. Yes ANY. Next gen at its finest. You can also boost yourself jump double jump dodge fly or destroy other cars by ramming them so hard it will rip the time itself (or by simply moving at 88mph). It's up to you to choose your position in the team. You can be mindful attacker or needed goalkeeper if you dare. And that's basically it. You move you get some goals you give some goals you win or you lose and again. After each win you also unlock new customization items such as said antennas colour types decals booster flame and hats... You REALLY can't forget a hat.There is tons and tons of little details and tactics you can use. But it's something you need to learn yourself. The game also offers very detailed and intuitive tutorial. And then there are visuals. Very colourful very nice and very clear. You see what you need. In options you can also find little but nice things like FOV camera height and others which will definitely makes everything better.Soundtrack is also a thing that deserves noting as it is very nice and very well done.But there's something that no game can avoid. Something that is missing or is simply bad or worse then the rest of the game. I personally think that the problem of the game is in minimum of maps each with basically the same standard field layout. This should however be changed with upcoming patches and updates as promised and siad by developers pretty recently.Other problem could be camera when it's locked on the ball and you are under it. It's coherent to some degree but sometimes you see nothing. In most cases you can get destroyed or pushed by another player without knowing he's going for you because you need to see the ball.And let's end it with third problem replay. There should be an option for naming them. But it's just a detail.I could go on and on with problems but everything else is just little things. That means that this game is really good almost perfect in its own way. And it's really really really... and I mean REALLY (like REALLY REALLY REALLY) addictive game. Really... Once you sit to this game you will not get up. I guarantee it. You will beg the god to make this game boring but I'll tell you a secret there is no god! (That grants this wish at least).And now if you know math a little you can very easily calculate it Fun + low price + addictive gameplay + nice audiovisuals + free updates + my recommendation stop reading this review and go buy this game goddammit!

2017-02-21,0,0,43,False,Not Recommended,"tl dr Steam controller is not working in Rocket League for macOS (but working fine for other games) and Psyonix has 1 intentions in fixing this albeit being aware of this issue for quite a while.I got Rocket League for free when I bought my Steam Controller but I've bought it multiple times after that for friends who couldn't afford it or didn't feel like spending the 20 bucks for it. Also I am playing under macOS which technically is a ""beta"". However the beta note isn't really visible and Steam promotes this with Full controller support even for macOS so I feel like this is appropriate.It used to be great since the game worked fine. The Steam controller worked great cross platform multiplaying worked fine everything was great. Fair enough they were some occasional crashes in certain maps but that's expected from a beta version. We had a good laugh restarted the game and everything was fine.And then December 2016 happened. They released an update which simply broke the Steam controller. No input nothing nada regardless of the configuration. That's fine happens and we all expected it to be fixed soon.It's now the end of February 2017 and it's still broken.Even worse they released a few patches since then adding more DLC content and other stuff to increase their revenue. That's fine but addressing stability issues would be another nice concern. In addition their support simply does not care. I've opened a ticket which got closed claiming that they are ware of it but the game is a beta and so I just have to deal with that. To make matters worse they didn't even manage to replace the placeholders in their response template the response literally started with ""Hi Insert Name "". They even included a link to their subreddit so I can check the community for help! Funny little boilerplate response.So it's fine. Their decision.

2017-08-11,1,6,2201,False,Not Recommended,The morons at Psyonix opt to ban players from playing the game simply because they don't like what players say in chat. Instead of disabling that persons chat abilities they put them in timeout like they're a little 3 year old. I bet when they aren't writing buggy code they are out hugging trees and saving whales. The broken matchmaking is also annoying as hell. You queue up a game wait for it all to load then one player can't join and you have to sit there and wait for the game to decide 'aww shucks' before it lets you return to the main screen and start all over (instead of just waiting for another player to join). The servers tend to run like crap most of the time... you can always tell when they reboot them everythign is buttery smooth... then slowly but surely gameplay goes to crap.Despite all the problems they have no shortage of DLC releases. Instead of making the base game better and more functionally sound they opt to pump all kinds of exciting garbage into the game to try and keep the interest of the 12 year olds they're also trying to protect from bad words. Keep sending them your money kids.,Rocket League®

2016-08-20,0,0,1760,False,Recommended,"The very best time waster there is to relax and pump yourself up at the same time. When you want to have an adrenaline rush big enough to pump you up and have a great time but small enough to keep you relaxed this is the game. Unlike say CS GO or StarCraft 2 Rocket League brings the best of both worlds casual and competitive play and blends the two together to give you the most fun possible. The skill cap in this game is incredibly high and you can never stop learning and getting better. It's fun to play it's fun to watch and also it's fun to fool around in additional modes (currently there are basketball and hockey variations along with Rocket Labs game mode with custom funnily twisted maps.) Oh and did I mention how much fun it is to customize your car? It's crazy. Pick a model paint it in different patterns pick the wheels boost pattern add a hat an antenna (or don't) and you can roll around in your awesome pirate or Holy Religion Jesus Something themed vehicle.You can really feel the speed of your car and the adrenaline kick is enough for a dopamine rush compared to getting high on chocolate flavour after workout pizza weed straight from the best weed plantation on the face of the earth.Buy it if you want to lose your 15 hours from your week every week. If you only want to lose 5 minutes of your day every day still buy it since this is the length of an average match.

2016-01-04,0,0,712,False,Recommended,EDIT Going to change this review to a pros/cons review because I got all into it.PROS+ Gameplay is very different from any other sports game which in this case makes this probably the best sports game out there. (No hate on sports fans I'm just a lazy er sitting on his desk all day long)+ Soundtrack is great+ The car customization it's really wide and you have a ton of options to choose from. (More coming )+ The game runs on my pc really well. Can play it on ultra with fps rarely dropping below 60.+ Unreal engine+ Game's price is spot on+ DLC is worth buying if you're interested in having more customization options. Since the DLC is cosmetic only it won't affect gameplay and thus is really well done.CONS Can get a bit grindy for some (personally idc) Community has become pretty toxic lately but what would you expect from a competitive game anyways. (Huge thank you for the small heroes who aren't being toxic I love you all!)And to sum this review up this game is 100% worth getting.

2016-01-11,0,0,395,False,Recommended,"Rocket League is a amazing game with simple ideas behind it hence it is ""Easy to play Hard to master"". The Game offers more dimensions to it then I first initially thought when i started playing rather than just mastering the skill behind hitting the ball(quite harder than you think when you first start) more aspects start to appear as you progress through the game. The Pay2Win effect is minimal in the game where cars do differ in terms of hitpoints/turning speed/control but is not a big deal. I would say how you get better/stronger in the game is from your own determination and practice. Even so you can still have some fun when you start playing and it will only get better from there when you start mastering more advanced aspects.Lastly the community is alright though it is still better than most. If you learn and understand the key aspects behind how teamwork works in the game such as Positioning and rotations(these should be fundamental) then people in your team shouldn't be giving you much trouble. However the game may get bit too competitive in which players may start throwing insults especially if your beating them by alot. Nonetheless there are still people out there that will always complain about stuff but its tolerable in this game.In Conclusion there is more to this simple game where it creates more enjoyment as you become better as a player. Understand key concepts and you will enjoy this game. I apologize for the large body of texts perhaps dot points may have been better.",Rocket League®

There is only 2v2 ranked for peopel who want to play with friends so if u want to play with up to 3 4 people online the only way is normals because you can only solo ranked for 3v3. The servers quite honestly at the moment are pretty bad about every 1/3 games the server will be bad and then the game is unplayable because you cannot control your vehicle or the ball because you slide around randomly. not able to invite people cross platform (not a massive con as most games are unable to do this)I would reccomend buying this game as it is one of the funest and most enjoyable games i have played in a while.

Oh that's right the goalie you tried to play bumper cars with just launched themselves across the map to score a Long Goal. Good job you. Did nothing productive the entire match and provided the goalie some entertainment. Might as well trash talk that goalie and steal his bank information only to get put down because his bank security is tighter and more protected than your goal.10/10 would recommend for goalie shenanigans.,Rocket League®

The mechanics were obviously what you'd expect from an N64 game but it was fun. This game took it to a whole new level.I love the competitiveness in the game. I like that you can cross play with PS4 players (although I wish you could party with PS4 players). Controller support is great!

It is now the only game I play consistently and it is consistently fun never a chore.As a bonus Psyonix are some of the coolest devs around.

You will be hated on until you want to uninstall. If you score a goal hope you don't have that one guy who spams ""What A Save"" after every goal. You will get hate.MidField Most People don't even know that this is a position. You're job is to keep the ball from going too far back. You want to try and set up your Strikers for goals.Unfortunately the second you miss an Ariel or any hit you're going to get hate.But it feels so good when you hit an Ariel. So keep calm and waste that boost.Goalie/Keeper This is probably the most important positions in the game.You're job is to keep the ball out of your net and to clear it up to your midfielders.But be warned the opponents and sometimes your own team will constantly run into you and get in your way.Missing a Save results in a goal and your opponents getting real mad at you. Oh and don't be that guy who gets the best spawn and stays back. Just don't. Well that's it. My review on Rocket League. Hopefully this boosts your interest in the game. Frost.",Rocket League®

2017-04-01,0,0,471,False,Recommended,Rocket league is all about the tense moment right before you start an aerial. The ball floating above the goal. All u must do is execute a perfectly double jump aerial to nudge the ball forward into the back of the enemies net. All of a sudden ur car decides to backflip instead of jumping. You miss the goal. The other team clears their shot goes in. Forever Potato 1.... (10/10 would backflip again),Rocket League®

2017-04-08,0,0,1156,False,Recommended,Ahhh. Rocket League a game recommended by my friends. To be perfectly honest it's probably one of the best games i've played so far it can be competitive and it can be a fun game to mess about. Though one thing that needs to be adressed is the RL servers. Over the recent couple of weeks they have been going down or became overloaded with mass amounts of people playing at the same time. Thanks to the developers there are no problems with the RL servers recently so that's good. D All i am going to say is that the developers of the game' psyonix' are doing a great job at updating the game by improving its aesthetics performance and overall gameplay. keep it up! One thing i love about RL is the humour(or salt in some cases) of the quickchat (Nice Shot! Great Pass!) all that craic. It's the irony that also makes it a fun game to mess around with your friends and just trigger some players. To finish this review i will be straight the 15.99 did not go to waste it's the hours of my life( you spend too much btw).__________________________________________ I'd give this game a solid 9/10 don't ask why.,Rocket League®

2015-12-30,0,0,458,False,Recommended,"All the fun and emotions you can imagine with an ordinary soccer game like dreamgoals last second comebacks ""kicking"" the ball off the line (also accidentely of the enemy's goal D) combined with the fun of a fast arcarde racing game. In the beginning you will be laughing your off only at the look of the small cars jumping and spinning around often out of control trying to prevent the ball from rolling into the goal.Then add the included and important rocket technology which will give you the needed speed advantage over your opponent or enough power for long range shoots or if you have learned it ability to reach balls high in the air. Air control and flying are crucial elements in higher skill areas and certainly raise the skill ceiling a lot. Then there's the possibility of good team play with friends or or your random assigned teammates that can decide a game against equally skilled opponents.The graphics are colorful and well made with nice physic effects especially regarding the visually customizable cars that said the game also runs good on older machines too.Matches are quick (5 minutes maybe + the golden goal like ""overtime"") you'll find one (1on1 2on2 3on3 4on4) in seconds (!) and you can choose between just for fun mode or elo ranked matchmaking.I really can't find any reason not recommend this game It's good for some in between matches but you will certainly find yourself and your mate(s) saying ""just one more we cant stop just now"" and shortly after an hour will have passed by..Now that I've already had so much fun with I can fairly say it's become one of my few alltime favorite games!",Rocket League®

2015-09-09,0,0,855,False,Recommended,My video review for the game https //www.youtube.com/watch?v Qk_Sri2SK6IPRESENTATIONRocket League has all the polish of a full triple A release but still with the price point of a normal indie game. Unreal engine 4 makes this game an absolute joy to look at while also still being relatively easy to run. The texture quality is gorgeous down to every last car and stadium. The environments are quite amazing to look at they do a great job of immersing you in the match. Combine that with the sound design of the cars and the crowds and you actually start to think you are inside of the arena driving the car. This game also has some of the best particle effects I ve seen in a game. Every spark every engine trail effect and there are a lot of them just look amazing. This is easily the best looking game I ve seen this year and definitely up there for best looking games I ve ever seen. CONTENTRocket League has enough content to keep entertained for a long long time. With seemingly endless amounts of ways to customize your car including decals boost trails paint colors types of paint wheels HATS and antennas. Add all of those with a good selection of cars you can have millions of different combinations. I ve been playing this game for a long time and I still haven t unlocked everything in the game. Another great thing this game offers is competent AI to play against. Rookie mode gives you an excellent way to practice at the game while All star mode gives a challenge to the experienced Rocket League players. Pick your team in season mode or grab some friends to play online and be entertained for hours. GAMEPLAYRocket League is a very unique game by nature. There are certainly not a lot of car soccer games especially not with boost power ups and jumping cars. Even though there aren t a lot of games like it Rocket League nailed their gameplay. It s an arcade racer at heart which is perfect for the fast paced action of the game. The cars handle very well on the ground gliding on the walls or in the air. The gameplay can be very tactical and team based at times. You have to utilize your boost at the right time you have to make sure you get the right angle on your shots and passes or they will go in every direction but the one you meant. Teamwork is incredibly useful it s the difference between winning big and losing big. The gameplay also takes some unique twist when you add or take away players. You can have 2v2 3v3 or 4v4 or even an unfair mode where you play by yourself against multiple AI players. Overall this game is incredible fun to play with friends or by yourself.,Rocket League®

The DLC can be quite poor the only one that looked good (personally) was the ""Back to the future"" DLC. However it is cheap so if you love the game then you will enjoy the add ons they are providing on a monthly basis.8/10 could use some extra functions in game but very entertaining and extremely competitive when with friends.Would recommend.",Rocket League®
2015-07-21,0,0,598,False,Recommended,I bought this game because my friends were all hyped about it. I bought it a few days after they did and I am not dissapointed. This game is extremely fun and has hours of competative soccer/car badassery. This game is so fun it makes losing almost an enjoyable experience.Pros Great single player game play Easy to Party up with friends Fast match quesGreat game mechanics and physicsGreat for all age groupsCons Takes about 5 to 10 games to get the hang of positioning boosts and so forthI wish there were more than 2 different camera angle optionsNo penalty for quitting a game The games are 5 minutes and people quitting after being down 2 goals is way to commonNo different game modes (yet)ConclusionGreat game to buy. Its worth every penny. Its one of those games where soring an average goal makes you feel like a boss. Hopefully they add more game types and customizable features. This game exceeded my expectations and I hope that they capitalize on the potential this game has for future development.,Rocket League®
2016-01-06,0,0,290,False,Recommended,'Rocket League' is one the purest multi player games I have ever played. It rewards individual skill teamwork and takes a step away from the upgrade systems we're so used to seeing in competitive multi players. You will not be rewarded with upgrades over time to give you an edge over the competition however you will be given cosmetic upgrades as you progress and build your skill at the game. This promotes skill based team focused gameplay and discourages relying on performance upgrades that you truly haven't earned to best your opponent. It's simply one of the most enjoyable multi player experiences I have ever had. Buy this game. Now. Do it... do it.,Rocket League®

Different game modes like hoops dropshot and rumble add a new fun spin and im sure there are more modes in the works as the game updates regularly. Competitive is optimized well and they are always tweaking it. Competitive can be frustrating but that is the same with any game. Overall i would say this game is a solid 9.5/10.

2017-07-13,0,0,1926,False,Recommended,"Amazing amazing amazing!! This is the best game I own period. Been playing it for 2 years I got it for $9.99 when it first released. It started when I saw my friend playing a game called ""Rocket League"" at first I had no idea what it was but the title seemed interesting so I had to look up gameplay on YouTube.Cars. Playing. Soccer. I was like...oh man! This game looks pretty good! So I bought it and started playing season mode at first. I still remember I lost my first match with rookie bots 3 1... but man!The first thing I noticed about this game is that the field format is like that of indoor soccer except with no out of bounds and rounded walls so you can ride up them. Having played indoor soccer for real before along with ROBLOX sports that gave me a general feel for positioning I thought it was awesome.This is the best game for someone who has wanted to play competitively but hasn't found something that mimicked the feel of real sports. It is the perfect title for you. I recommend starting out with season mode like I did with bots maybe on rookie for your first match and then set them to Professional that way they will be using boost just like you will.But here's the game's greatest accomplishment Online mode. There hasn't been a game on Steam or Origin or on any other platform period that has had the longevity and competitiveness of this game before. There is a mode for everyone in competitive play 3v3 in a group 2v2 1v1 or 3v3 solo. You can join any of the modes on your own but for 2v2 and 3v3 in groups (called ""Standard"" in game) I highly recommend you have friends/teammates in a party. Of course there is a casual mode as well but I love to play in a competition context.Every car although some have their differences (""Octane"" being the most popular) feel pretty much or nearly the same in terms of handling. There are no real ""statistical"" advantages with any car wheel or any item a person using the car Octane can be just as good as someone that uses Grog for instance.Some of the cars are DLC you can buy in the DLC section of the game on Steam or inside Rocket League. The amazing thing is the DLC does not provide any advantage to your car. Rocket League is 100% free of any pay to play strategy. The only factor is the skill you have playing the game yourself.There are also ""Crates"" and ""Keys"" that have been added about a year ago these offer exclusive items that can only be found inside said crates. The keys cost real money however with enough time you might be able to save up crates to trade to someone for a key. There are websites specialized for finding Rocket League trading including the official /r/RocketLeagueExchange on reddit. There are also specialized sheets you can find for market valuation on the items inside crates measured in keys. I know it has already been mentioned several times in my review but no these also do not provide an advantage to people that have crated items. There are even different modes in casual play for someone who is looking to play a different sport Basketball hockey (the ball is replaced with a puck) and even a specialized ""Dropshot"" mode where the ball has to be slammed on the ground in order to score.In summary Rocket League is the perfect game for everyone. Those looking for competitive play for rewards at the end of the season or those who just want to have a good game to play together with their friends. I highly recommend this game for me it's filled a competitive void in my life.",Rocket League®

2016-02-27,0,0,19,False,Recommended,Recommended for all gamers.Fun and addictive best to play with friends. Pros Customizable cars. Unlockable customizables. Variety of maps. Variety of settings you don't have to just play a regular game you can change gravity ball weight ball shape etc. Good soundtrack could use more but not complaining. Keeps you busy for hours. Awesome DLCs.Cons I believe they made it so you can only get some drops if you play online matches rough for those who dislike playing online. Playing online tends to force you to turn your graphics quality basically all the way down depending where you connect. The AI sucks when starting out on Rookie. They tend to score on their own goal. Extremely funny nonetheless.,Rocket League®
2016-04-24,0,0,51,False,Recommended,"I played this during the free weekend because I was honestly sure I wouldn't like it.But hot digity damn this game is addictive!!I will say as many others have said before me This game feels more like football than football games.Because you control one character yourself! And you have to set up goal chances for your teammates and dribble like nobody's business!I don't usually enjoy football either IRL or in games like FIFA but this game can be enjoyed by anyone doesn't matter if you're not into sports. I will say that knowing the way to set up goal chances as they actually do in real football games really help and just knowing how to move around at all.During the free weekend I went on skype with a friend and all off a sudden we had played for over four hours.You will most likley just keep playing game after game after game.And the server search is so ing fast you won't have time to sip from your drink between matches!All in all love this game!It's extremly fun to play with friends while communicating.Hectic and hella fun!PS When I say ""football"" I of course mean the real football not Hand egg.",Rocket League®

2016-11-23,0,0,57,False,Recommended,You're pretty much playing soccer with cars that have rocket boosters attached to them which is every bit as fun as it sounds and then some.

2016-07-15,0,0,1837,False,Recommended,First of all from starting using controllers I've handled them wrong having my index fingers on the LT/RT buttons rather than the LB/RB ones. This game once I wanted to evolve my skills further made me overcome the resistance of 15 years of wrong handling to actually start using the controller as it was intended. That being said this is a game that is built on skill but not impossible for anyone. A good matchmaker that eventually allows for even and good matches no matter how skilled you yourself are. Go ranked and get a rating that will set the matchup or play unranked and get set mainly based on your experience the amount of matches you've played in total (I think). The game also includes various options to play by yourself against bots (including a league) and for unranked games if the teams are uneven in number of players a bot will replace until someone else joins. On top of that the DLC's are all about skins basically you can get different cars but there's no difference in performance so there's no pay to win in any way. Overall it's easy enough for some quick enjoyment and if you like you can develop some pretty serious skill and work your way up the ranking system. For the ranked games you start of with 10 games as unranked before you achieve a rank in the appropriate division.For me this game has given very good value for the money and I recommend it strongly.,Rocket League®

2016-03-14,1,2,88,False,Recommended,I haven't found any bugs or issues it runs smoothely looks great and I rarely have connection problems which is saying a lot considering how spotty the internet service is where I live(rural about an hour from the nearest town.) The game is a lot of fun if I've got at least one friend to play it with otherwise it's a nightmare. The public games are awful. Everybody just seems to want to hit the ball as hard as they possibly can no matter what direction they're facing even if that means sending it into their own goal. They make serious attempts at touching the ball at the last moment before the ball goes in the goal to steal the credit. They like to slam into you at top speed and ruin a perfectly lined up and undefended shot to try getting at the ball they want to blast across the field even though a bird could flap its wings in the next state over and that would be enough to get the ball in the goal. I would say two out of ten times your teammate in a public game might actually try to defend the goal. Finally if you join a game already in progress there's a pretty good chance it's because the person you're taking the place of has rage quit the game because their teammate was doing some or all of what I just talked about and now you're stuck with them.,Rocket League®

Whenever you talk about it to people they're always asking ""well doesn't it get boring? It's just the same thing over and over"" and you can understand why they think that.But there's some beauty when it comes to the game. It's almost like its simplicity is its strength with this environment where you can apparently only do one thing you're able to do almost anything. It's almost got a sandbox feel to it always competing but trying out new things and I can safely say that after 1000 hours there's still so much to learn.Price wise is fantastic and if you've got the funds available I can't recommend it above don't be overwhelmed when you can't do what you want at the start just give the game the couple of hundred hours it deserves and evaluate your situation then.",Rocket League®

2016-11-23,0,0,967,False,Recommended,Absolutely love this game. At first I thought the game might end up being rather repetitive but is hasnt. True the game follows the same principle every game a ball the enemy goal and go kick it in. But the amazing thing about this game is that there is always more to learn more epic stuff to do. The feeling that you get when you pull of your first aerial goal is amazing. It might not look like it on first glance but the possibilities in this game are near endless. I suggest you give it a shot and dont be discouraged if you cant pull of that aerial in your first 10 hours of playtime. Only negative thing I would say about this game are the newer maps they have released. They tend to be just a little different then the ones you have gotten used to. A little bigger a little smaller the floor not being even. Or in the case of the Neo Tokyo map just a totally different design. It basically screws over all the things you have learned when playing those maps.EDIT The issue with the new maps has since been fixed and the maps have been reworked to follow the way the other maps are.,Rocket League®

I'm a little put off by the implementation of crates and keys as they've ruined another game that I've put hundreds of hours in. In any case this game has the perfect balance of easy to play hard to master and a learning curve that is friendly to new users. Overall this game gets an easy 9/10 and remains my game of the year for 2015. A year described really well by game critic Razorfist The year when indie broke out and triple A broke down. Seriously just buy the damn game.Update 2 Steam really loves making me add more reviews for badges but seriously I always come back to this game for a reason. 600 hour mark has been crossed and I'm now in Champion 1 couldn't have asked for a better game for just $20 may honestly be the best money I've ever spent.,Rocket League®

It sounds NOTHING like the batmobile. It sounds more like Kanye singing through a hair dryer. The goal effects they show in the trailer where a batman symbol appears ? remember that epic thing ? yeah. Doesn't exist. Was just trickery to get you to buy the DLC.Scumbags. Liars. Thieves.

Death Threats Harrasing and other bad behaviour kind of stuff but you can report such player though and hope the offender will be punished.Also the crate and trade system i don't bother quite much with it because all items are cosmetic and does nothing to gameplay.Still I recommend this game. it's a lot of fun XD.Grade 10/10,Rocket League®
2015-07-29,0,0,141,False,Recommended,If you are a competitive person who wants to play games to get better at it I suggest you not to buy it.

2017-10-20,5,59,12113,False,Not Recommended,I love the game have played tonnes of hours and have finally decided to review the game not to say how awesome it is but to say how shamefully Psyonix has performed in terms of server development and maintenance. The most consistent aspect of the game since it was first released has been that you could rely on a consistently poor server experience. Buy this game if you enjoy server lag. Psyonix needs to do the right thing and address the server issues. Clearly more of the revenue needs to be directed to ensuring a reliable server experience. I hope it happens but dont really expect it at this point.,Rocket League®
2017-08-20,9,59,520,False,Not Recommended,The ranking system in this game is just miserable. It can take up to 3 wins to rank up a divison and you can lose that division in 1 loss. Almost impossible to win sometimes because the game pairs you with lower levels or people who are worse than you and you win 2 games in a row but then the next 2 games after that you're the one thats worse than the other team. Its just a constant battle between ranks teammates and trying not to break your controller/keyboard.,Rocket League®
2016-09-05,2,27,2589,False,Not Recommended,This used to be a great game to play with friends but the latest update means that if you're not the same rank then there's little point to play. The new change means the highest ranking person on your team denotes the matchmaking party. So a new guy an avg guy and a high ranked player get matched against 3 high ranked players for example. This just means you get stomped on most games. My friends and family have since stopped playing and we used to game regularly each night. I regret buying all the DLC now since I can't play with my buddies. Real shame.

2016-12-10,0,0,983,False,Not Recommended,"im giving this a (hopefully temporary) thumbs down. update dec 29 2018 i still dont recommend. matchmaking sucks 2v2 games too often contain a bot to replace a player and the bots are so bad they are worse than beginner players. these matches shouldnt even be started. i hate to complain about cosmetics but they just suck in this game that bad that i need to. at first i thought all the heart and flower cosmetics were like troll stuff to be funny or that the devs give you unicorn horns and rainbow trials at low level and they get better or something. they dont. the devs seem really stingy with cosmetics and none of them are good anyways there are no tools to effectively trade them with other players in a way thats worth your time. as for the older issues below they did eventually simply redesign the bad maps that players hated into a standardized layout that players wanted...however it really took way too long to do and i think they only did it because they realized people were quitting matches over it and even uninstalling the game over the issue. way too slow to respond. developer is hard headed and doesnt listen. the latest patch really screwed the pooch. the latest patch was supposed to introduce an ""arena preferences"" feature so you could play less of the maps you dislike and more of the ones you like. first you can only thumbs down two maps and many players have several they dislike. second the likes and dislikes dont even seem to work you still get put into maps you dont like very often probably more than before. finally they also added the ""labs"" (experimental) maps to the standard queue. these maps are really different with many problems and now players are forced to queue into them. (edit Psyonix removed the labs maps for now to fix a bug with them being selected too often but said they will put them back when the bug is fixed)so instead of actually playing more of the maps you like and less of the ones you dont its become the opposite literally. total fail. if/when this is fixed i will change the review. edit the following maps are not part of labs maps but are still in ranked and standard and you will get queued for them even if you dislike them hate them never want to play them Aquadome I run this map fine but many players report poor fps on this map even if other maps get very good FPS. Psyonix said they improved it but some still have problems. This map is way too ""busy"" in appearance and is resource heavy. too many polygons and animations going on. Starbase ARC also way to ""busy"" in appearance with poor color choices. ball blends in with background small boost pads are hard too see. Tokyo Probably the most hated map in the game. too narrow doesnt flow well has the most annoying ledges on the sides that make the map not fun. it doesnt matter if you dislike the map the game will queue you for it anyways. if you leave the map in ranked you will get a temp ban if you leave in unranked you lose MMR. other than the issue of being forced to queue for maps you dont want to play on this game is amazing and easily GOTY of 2016 in my opinion.",Rocket League®

2016-07-01,0,0,202,False,Recommended,You wanna buy some game but you don't know which? Try this game! Well i wanted to buy 3 games. I knew 2 games that i wanted to buy. Then i saw this game and i was like nahhhh.... It looks good but i don't know if i would play this game... So i bought 3 games and first i tried Rocket League. I was like OMG!!! THATS SO AWESOME!! So the thing is i really recommend this game if you have friends to play with its way better then just playing with online people. But i play with online people too and i still love this game. In real life i don't really love football/soccer i like racing cars but not really much. I wouldn't ever think it but racing cars + football/soccer is a nice combination! I just love this game. Multiplayer is nice gameplay too... Well i still have to say 1 thing it was lagging for me. But i just reduced graphics (nice graphic settings) and it was nice. I have like 30 40 fps which is actually really nice for me. As i already said this game is for you if you love football/soccer or racing cars (I dont like any of it but i love this game.) That's all i think and i hope this review helped you if it did leave a like and bye! Enjoy this nice good and awesome game! &gt Sergeant Banana recommends ),Rocket League®

2017-01-06,0,0,70,False,Recommended,Best sports game ever in my book. It's really simple and easy to learn yet difficult to master. The gameplay is in a nutshell 2 teams of up to 4 players competting to score the most goals beforethe match ends using adorable rc cars wth rocket boosters. The soundtrack is good graphics look nice and it has lots of different maps to play on. However the maps are only different in the background (no traps or anything like that) there are some glitches in the game like being able to actually leave the arena and explore infinity and beeyond / . If you are a new player and want to get good fast the game has a good amount of tutorials for you to learn and practice there are 3 difficulties to each practice rookie pro and allstar each one is increasingly harder. the games focus is on multiplayer (wich is really good) but if you want a singleplayer experience you can play exhibition (create your own game ai or players choose maps etc and choose mutators) or you can play seasons wich is basicallya tournament (singleplayer) beetwen your team and a bunch of other teams (ai) you play a certain amount of rounds until the teams with the most wins compete in the finals whoever wins wins the seeason and the game. There is an impressive amount of customazation (however ya spell it) in the game mostly for your. you can choose what flags toopers color paterns etc you want on your car. splitscreen is supported in this game and all game modes are customazable. this game is true gem in all of gaming and if you like sports games this is a must own Verdict 10/10 Amazing!,Rocket League®

Yep its that crazy of a game.Matches are really quick and intense action never stops. Zero downtime...finds next match really fast.Cross platform play with ps4( no party invites yet cross platform) but it does help make the matches fill up. More games need to take notice.Season mode for single player with bots is actually enjoyable. Not many games pull that off.Split screen.Amazing price point on Steam and as of writing free on ps4 with plus.A true sport for gamers.

2016-04-26,0,0,6,False,Recommended,Rocket League is a very fun game to be honest I can't think of one flaw in the game other than I need to get better at it that's for sure. It is very challenging and has me on my toes every single time I get close to making a goal or has me on my feet when I do make one. But I got to say it is a very fun game after each match you unlock a different item mainly common stuff but you never know what is next and there are some dope stuff like paint rims antennas and more. Also this game has all kind of different game modes such as hockey if you are feeling slick some basketball if you feel like the real MVP and of course soccer. I would say to get this game no doubt I know you will have just as much fun as I do if not more and it's just a good game to even mess around on and play oh I forgot to mention you can do flips and climb walls too just get the damn game yo!,Rocket League®

It's tons of fun!There's lots of things to unlock and they seem to be given randomly after each match. But it's only cosmetic. There are no stats for the cars and your choice of adornments doesn't have any effect on gameplay. I expected microtransactions to buy hats wheels maps etc. But nope! This game hasn't succumbed to the cancer that is microtransactions. There is some DLC for a few cars but the DLC doesn't give you anything that affects gameplay and you still get access to 100% of the maps and game features without the DLC.

Even when you're searching for a match take advantage and warm up in the training.The best way to play as a beginner is with a party so if you have friends who play this game play with them.I do recommend a controller for this game I personally use the Xbox360 afterglow controller seems to be running very well.Another thing to add change the controller key binds and camera settings to what makes you most comfortable.It's possible to play splitscreen too if you have 2(or more) wired controllers you can plug them in and enjoy splitscreen with your friends.As for the DLC if you want to get one i recommend the Supersonic Fury DLC.

2015-07-26,0,0,2231,False,Recommended,Lots of fun for sure. The matchmaking mechanic still needs more work and they should tweak the party mechanic to make it a little easier. Right now the only way I could find add friends to your game was through steam which was a bit clunky. The other thing that I couldn't find is a way to have your party of two join a 3v3 or 4v4 online game instead of always just the 2v2. I tried it with a friend who had just got the game and we got clobbered 2v2 every time...lol So either play with friends who have some experience or avoid the party thing unless you want to loose every game. Great little game though and very addictive.,Rocket League®

2016-01-22,0,0,147,False,Recommended,The game itself is ingenious and really fun to play from the beginner phase to the more advanced levels. It's easy to learn and hard to master as a good game should be. Mastering the techniques in the game (aerials wall shots etc.) really do make the difference but it's absolutely playable without hundreds of hours into practice towards this tech. Gameplay is fast paced entertaining and makes you and your friends laugh. It looks good runs great and online gameplay is also completely fine most of times. Occasionally you'll come across some goofy looking clip throughs and stuff like that due to the netcode priorisation in lag but this is minor and acceptable. Best served in the loving company of friends.Speaking of company unfortunately the downside of this now greatly popular game (and rightfully so) is its diseased community. As many know some games suffer from screaming kids and hate speech more than others and it seems that somehow that bad mentality known from for example parts of the the Counter Strike community (only game fitting to the script which I have more experience from) has migrated to Rocket League. I guess it's an inevitable course of social progress to some extent as long as there's these kind of people who want to embrace the rage and spread bad vibes around them. But on the bright side the only way to diminsh this kind of diseased social behaviour is to kill it with kindness. Why not join the love onslaught?For you the good lass or lad I sincerely recommend this game for you and your friends for you to enjoy all the nice moments playing it.,Rocket League®

Mechanics are really smooth. Trickshots boost your ego. So yeah.Audio 7/10 The Audio in the game is cool but I overall still prefer using my own tracks as background music. Especially because it's really hard to get the perfect volume in this game no idea why. The SFX are nicely done and fit.Online 9/10 Considering the usual online playercount of 130k player average the servers are actually really stable. Only rarely have I encountered any lag whatsoever and even if I do it's usually ver slight. If it's too big np. Just start a new match.Rocket League 10/10 Yeah the cars are actually able to fly.

2015-10-11,0,0,78,False,Recommended,Rocket League is an incredible experience! It runs on Unreal Engine so you can adjust the graphic and other qualities in the game. I first started watching my friend play and thught it was just an overglorified soccer game. But it's not until you play it yourself that you truely understand why so many people play this game. The experience is overall amazing and super easy to learn but not so easy to master. This game is very addicting and will reel you in with every five minute round you play. 10/10,Rocket League®

2016-01-03,0,0,27,False,Recommended,Rocket League is a fun fast paced player vs. player physics based soccer (and now hockey) game with acrobatic R/C rocket cars. While I personally have never had a taste for sports games of any kind I can't help but thoroughly enjoy this. It is a fever dream of bizare elements that some how come together in spectacular form to produce a game that while fun and accessible still has tight enough controls and game structure to allow ample room for player skill and no small amount of luck to take center stage in what can range from delightful chaos to nail biting competitive play. Every aspect of the game from physics to controls graphics and UI have been polished to perfection making this consistantly one of the most fun games in my library.,Rocket League®

2017-09-13,0,0,999,False,Recommended,Pros Easy to learn hard to master. After 750+ hours I'm having as much fun as I was at the start. Plus it's an easy game to convert friends to even for casual gamers it looks appealing and is easy enough to jump in to. Awesome developpers. Psyonix are active in the community and seem to take on board feedback from the players. Updates are regular and often contain substantial new content. Pretty cars. Car customisation is addictive and fun. Con Toxicity The ultra high pace heavy reliance on teamplay and the highly competitive nature of the game can turn people into monsters. Psyonix have recently implemented a new auto ban system to combat this though which seems to be working to an extent. Honestly if you've read this far just stop wasting your own time and buy it.

The Matchmaking works good and fast the longest Time i had to wait for a match was about 15 seconds. Cons The players themself. Just imagine following Situation You're shooting the ball towards the Goal no opponent in sight. The Ball WILL HIT THE GOAL AND YOU SCORED IT BY YOURSELF. But what happens next? Some Greedy ""Teammate"" simply jumps into the ball and misses the Goal. Just because he wanted to score by himself.

2017-04-30,1,1,250,False,Recommended,Amazing game. Something so simple yet so intriguing and challenging. Soccer with cars. Sounds simple but there are so many moves added to the controls that this game is quite advanced. You dont just hit the ball you can boost dodge flip rotate and do many other maneuvers with your car. The concept is simple yet hard to master. Not gonna lie it is frustrating as it so difficult but I enjoy every second of it and find myself coming back for more. The game is just overall great for anyone. One thing I especially love about this game is the details of the cars. Some have proper V8 Engines sticking out the bonnet with the lumpy cam idle and turbo charger sound effects. I reckon car enthusiasts would find that quite nice. And people who play real soccer would of course like the game. Overall a great game. I rate 11/10.,Rocket League®

2017-01-26,0,0,98,False,Recommended,Rocket League is just a feel good game that you can enjoy with friends or on your own. You can be casual or competitive and the gameplay is fun and addictive. Microtransactions are for cosmetics and the one issue I have with that is how addictive it is to buy them. The cosmetics come in 2 ways DLC packs that include cars and a few rocket trails or crates that work similar to the loot boxes in Overwatch. However you earn these crates at random and have to purchase keys to open them. Cosmetics in the crates can range from wheels to animated decals to rocket trails and more. I would highly reccomend this game whether you're on the fence or just looking for a new fun game to get.,Rocket League®

2015-08-16,0,0,104,False,Recommended,I would highly recommend this game to the one who seeks for an addictive indie and competitive sport game. Also it's an excellent time killing game because a match takes only five minutes. The game is easy to learn but hard to be pro at it. More interestingly playing with friends would be perfect and fun as communication is very important. It can be ridiculously hilarious at times especially when playing with friends!,Rocket League®
2016-01-06,3,1,404,False,Recommended,"Rocket League is a very fun and enjoyable game even if it is somewhat lacking in variety. Much more exciting than ""normal"" football and a lot more tense. Controls are easy to learn but hard to master allowing more skilled players to shine above others. Matches are short and can seem quite hectic but a team with proper tactics will still be in a better position to win than a team that doesn't work together.

Mostly because it actually requires real skill and a lot of time to master.

2016-01-24,1,1,1176,False,Recommended,"Ok so I bought this game about 2 weeks after it was first released on steam and currently I have dedicated approximately a full month of play time into figuring out every aspect that this amazing game has to offer and I am more than willing to make that into a year.Everything from how to correctly and properly hit the ball towards the other team's goal to how to out play your opponents by learning to actually pass the ball to your teammate(s) has been the most time consuming yet highly enjoyable gaming experience. Every major update has gifted us with amazing new content that allows the player to indulge himself/herself in the game for hours without growing tired of what it has to offer. For example the ""Mutators"" update allowed for a new player to learn the ins and outs of the game's mechanics a lot faster by enabling a ""Slow mo"" option in the Mutator settings of a private match. Psyonix has been gracious to consumers and has provided everyone with new maps and new models for the original cars absolutely free.With the addition of ranked matches many moons ago the entire mood of the game was altered for the better. Even now with every new season we find major and minor changes to the competitive system that proves that Psyonix is attentative to player feedback.The recent addition of crates and player to player trading has attracted a lot more people to this game and has allowed for them including myself to show off their ""passion"" for the game (thats what I tell myself to justify the amount of money I have spent on DLC and keys). And if you don't want to be tempted into spending your money on keys like I have they have a setting that you can turn on that disables you from being able to view crates in your inventory and new crates that you get after a match.Watching this beautiful game grow and develope into an esports worthy title has been a wonderful trip for my friends and I. Can't wait to see this game go even further than the heights that it has reached this far.",Rocket League®

2015-12-27,0,0,25,False,Recommended,Rocket League uses the competitive side of sports games like Madden FIFA NBA and NHL (just to name a few) and adds the teamwork of those games also but with a twist. Exted of throwing a football for a touchdown or slam dunking with a basketball you are bumping a soccer. Sounds like FIFA but it is not. The ball you bump is big and you bump it with your customized car. This game brings hours and hours of rage teamwork hate and competiveness.

2015-12-27,0,0,277,False,Recommended,"I've had a lot of friends sit down and watch me play and after a while ask why this game is fun to me.Why is it fun? It's a simple concept albeit somewhat ridiculous that involves competition and improving ""skill"" at the game. Same way any sport is fun I suppose you play for that competitive spirit and for the thrill of winning. Compound that with the absurdity of the concept that's what makes it interesting. That immediate satisfaction after scoring a goal or making an epic save that makes you feel good just like in actual soccer or (perhaps more appropriately) hockey.So why do I keep going back to Rocket League even though I have all of these different games? There's something to be said for the coordination and strategy involved in a game that's so seemingly mindless and simple.After a decent amount of ""supervised"" play time by friends I like to think they understand what the appeal of the game is now and even get excited when I try to pull off a crazy play (and like to chastise me when I mess it up).",Rocket League®

2016-08-28,1,1,937,False,Recommended,Rocket League is something I thought I wouldn't enjoy having never been a sports game sort of guy. But this game had me hooked from the first game. After over 100 hours I still can't explain why I think it's so great but it's so easy to just jump into and play that it's become my go to game when nothing else in my library is of interest at the time. It's simple exciting challenging and pulling off amazing moves (for my level I'm hardly championship material) is an amazing feeling and brings me back for more despite the numerous failed epic moments. Games are populated very well with people generally at my level to ensure a good game where I'm not too overwhelmed by people of skill levels many times greater than my own. Learning to fly and score goals from an unwieldy rocket powered car is quite honestly one of the best things I've ever experienced in my long gaming career. Could not recommend this game any higher.

2015-08-14,0,0,711,False,Recommended,I just bought the game and started out with the tutorial. This was very easy to manage and helped me figure out all neccesary commands. I like that there is also an advanced tutorial but this is very short and may just as well be a part of the regular one.Now to the game itself. I have only played local games against computer players but I like that you can choose the team size. The first impression is excellent. I could barely put the controller down and I did not want to stop playing.There are many customization items for your garage that can be unlocked.All in all i think this might end up being a very addictive game.Finally a quick word to how the game runs.I am running it on a Windows 10 Desktop and it runs perfectly fine so far.I would recommend playing this game with a controller if possible,Rocket League®

2015-07-19,0,0,990,False,Recommended,Rocket League is insanity on wheels. With a football.The basis of Rocket League is as basic as it gets. You get in a car drive around a pitch and score goals. The cars do all the normal stuff plus the are able to jump and boost. That's all there is to this game as far as features go. But then the game starts and it gets utterly fantastically gloriously mental. Cars bouncing around doing flips driving along walls doing a boost to get in front. It's a fast pace action football game that is more addictive than any game has a right to be. Be sure to stick to multiplayer though as single player just doesn't deliver you the experience of playing this in teams of up to 4 cars per side.,Rocket League®

2015-09-04,0,0,160,False,Recommended,This game is extremely entertaining. It's just accessible enough for anyone to pick up and start chasing the ball down but still has an incredible amount of depth behind it.

I'd personally like to see different field designs for casual play No option for music during gameplayAt the end of the day the game is fast frenetic and fun.

2015-08-04,0,0,279,False,Recommended,To be completely honest I had doubts about this game. The concept of sports mixed with cars seemed strange. I saw some videos and decided to give it a try. The first game I played got me hooked. The competitiveness of the game took me places NBA2K never took me. The controls are very simple I was worried about hard controls when I bought it. I was also afraid none of my friends would buy it. The games I played alongside Randoms were actually pretty great. The customisation is insane but it can all be unlocked fairly quickly. I always love it when it goes to Overtime and next goal wins because thats when it gets real. The whole atmosphere of the game when that happens is insane. There is no time sitting still and fiddling with your thumbs.This game is so fun and addicting that it will be very hard for me to put it down. Expect updates.Very fun with everyone and amazing customizations. Great idea. I see this game going far. 10/10,Rocket League®
2015-07-28,0,0,35,False,Recommended,Seven hours in and Rocket League is my favorite game of all... I dislike football and like cars but somehow this game has brought amazing laughter to my face and insane fun whilst at friends houses on PS4.Their community is great too! The forums are accessible to anyone game or no game and the devs are on fire with their concept. I have had a few problems but then again they're fixing everything best they can and I can't knock them for the small faults I have come accross.Being the only game I have spent over 10 on (steam wise) I think it is great and really makes a change for me considering I only normally play MMORPGs such as TERA and WoW.Well worth the money even if you hate football!,Rocket League®

Online gamplay is great if your ping is somewhere below 150 you'll forget you are on an online match. Match making is good and you can even play online with a couch friend for extra fun.Give it a try if you like sports cars mario kart? video games. Also local multiplayer FTW!,Rocket League®

2016-02-22,0,0,1061,False,Recommended,Probably one of the most enjoyable multiplayer games of all time! I don't really care about football or cars yet I cannot stop playing it.Fun on your own. Even more fun with friends. Games are fast and intense. Works great with a controller. Pretty decent 2 4 player splitscreen for couch gaming with your mates. The game is really easy to get into yet the skill ceiling is very high. If you want to get a feel for what it looks like at high levels of play I suggest checking out Gibbs Kronovi or Low5ive on YouTube.One note of caution although the game is sort of cross platform between PC and PS4 you currently cannot create parties with your PS4 friends if you are playing on PC.,Rocket League®

2016-05-13,1,1,375,False,Recommended,No tycoon yet or multiplayer yet. But for some strange reason I like this game. I review this game from a perspective where I knew very little about cars. I could only tell you about a few thing but now I actually feel as if I know a little bit about cars. For instance I had no clue how a turbo charger worked but know I have a good knowing of what happens inside the snail shaped pace machine. My friends who don t care or know anything about cars hate this game because they ask why you can t drive or use the tycoon. I try to explain to them that I want to support these types of games I like these types of game and the more funds you or me give the faster you will get these features much eagerly awaited. Once this game gets updated then it will be a premier game. Until then I will be waiting patiently for updates. This game has a long way to go but if more and more people invest things will constantly improve. This game is fun and educational and that is a category I have never been fortunate enough to play until now. That is why I recommend this game to the people who know nothing or everything about cars to learn something and enjoy at the same time.,Rocket League®

They added tons of DLC and FREE MAPS. Oh yeah it's possible to mod the game for custom maps toppers skins and more.Pros + Amazing graphics+ Easy controls (use a controller for most enjoyment)+ Hours Days of fun+ Fun competitive matches+ Tons of ways to customize your car+ 4 player splitscreen+ Cross platform+ Gameplay keeps you on your toesCons Some bugs every now and then but they always get fixedTL DR This game is awesome even if you don't like sports.

2015-11-15,0,0,37,False,Recommended,This game is very hectic and has a lot of action yet it is a very fun game and even more so when you have more friends to play with. The combination of rocket propelled cars and soccer is an unusual combination but nonetheless is a well received combination and is a good game to buy for a cheap price $19.99 for one copy and $59.99 for four. Though it's not very good on keyboard controls I had to play with keyboard once because I forgot my controller somewhere else.Pros Has a lot of action Crazy rules can be added which make this game very fun Split screen multiplayer can be done with multiple controllers which can be fun when playing with more people Cheap $19.99 Not that easy which makes it funCons Keyboard controls are atrocious,Rocket League®
2016-04-21,0,0,1578,False,Recommended,There will be moments of absolute greatness cheering and crying. Moments of complete awe and wonder as to how you got that goal it will fill you with focus and confidence. You'll start learning how to hit the ball off the wall and then you'll start experimenting with aerial and maybe even driving backwards! Sometimes you might like to drive slow and dance around some players to make them rage quit. There will also be dire moments of frustration complete madness screaming throwing things smashing walls breaking mice keyboards keyboard trays desks monitors headphones fish tanks and finally limbs. This is type of game that really sets the bar when its comes to REAL competitive gameplay that is well structured and utilizes a simple preset chat system that can help you rub in that goal you got or make you feel like a complete fool! 14 keyboards down and counting!The graphics are amazing the physics engine is top notch and the game is virtually bug free! I've never played such a well made game in such a long time.My only dislike for this game is with internet connectivity lag issues and server rubberbanding. The rubberbanding has mostly gone away completely now (thanks!). However if you use a wireless repeater/router to connect to your modem make sure its faster than 300mbps. The signal likes to fluctuate in strength and it will cause all sorts of terrible input lag in game ranging from really wide turns sloppy handling losing complete control of the car not being able to time boosting and jumping properly. I recommend this game be played on a network with a wired connection. I've experience much less lag with a wireless network card but wired is the most stable.P.S...Learn how to be a goalie to get used to aerial so mastering flying is easy.

2016-05-29,0,0,252,False,Recommended,"In this review I can tell you the step of the classes/group of levels in this game ( which you newbies WILL Acquired it) Rookie ITS JUST SO HARD TO TOUCH THE BALL you will feel like a stupid car run out of boost while shooting thin air. Semi Pro You will hit the ball once per while and you will make that little smile in your heart while you at it. You crave for that "" Nice Shot! "" or "" What A Save!"" but still you cant do it (This is where i am right now)Pro Well... you not really a pro yet but a better person and skill than Semi Pro. You can aim the ball towards you want but maybe 45 degrees or maybe 90 degrees where you aim it. Still nice try. You will try aerial or flying your car several times even its gonna be too highVeteran Welcome to the world of basic aerial! Your ground work much better now your aerial become useful for the team but sometime burden. you can basicly dribble the ball towards the goal. You can Save the ball easier now because you know where it headed.Still you cant save f**ing Expert Shooting from aerial in not reasonable place to shot.Expert You're that f**ing Expert Shooting from aerial in not reasonable place to shot. Because when you see the ball in the air you gonna start flying and actually HIT the the ball where nobody cant reach it you missed the ball several times but your team or your enemy WILL not care because they know You.Are.Pro. Also you can hit Wall Aerials which is SO HARD TO DO.Master I Met them a lot. i can tell you one thing about Masters. YOUR WORST NIGHTMARE. Passing shooting basic aerial dribbling wall shot they can do it no sweat. If you a master now well you can smile a bit because We are scared of you and if we got you in our team. ""OMG""Legend I only met legend twice My god you will not understand the physics you learn in Highshool. WHAT THE FU** WITH THAT AIR DRIBBLE? Trust me if you see what i saw ur ded.Also shooting and dribbling Messi. SO ACCURATE.Rocketeer Funny i met Rocketeer in matchmaking 3 4 times more than a legend. They have all the Legend traits but they got one that no one have. A COMPLETE PLAYER TRAIT. If this guy play defense. That f**ing Expert Shooting from aerial in not reasonable place to shot is gonna be blocked. If this guy play strike well you need another Rocketeer or maybe Veteran Legends to match up or maybe a good teamwork can save you. THE BALL WILL RARELY TOUCH THE GROUND. They even intentionally pass the ball to the air and then another rocketeer intentionally BACKFLIP HIT IT TOWARDS THE GOAL. More than a worst nightmare. Its your graveWell that's all i can tell about Rocket League Classes from my experience. if somone disagree like "" Im a rookie but i can hit aerials!"" feel free to write commentsAnyway Greatest.Multiplayer.Ever with great community (you wont meet ""Your momma"" jokes here"") with a lot great tutorial in youtube that you can learn from.AND THIS AWESOME CARS11/10",Rocket League®

2016-06-11,0,0,976,False,Recommended,I enjoy a variety of game genres but never would I have thought that one of my favorite games ever would be a sports/soccer like game where you control a ground and aerial double jumping boost until you break the sound barrier vehicle. Pretty much every aspect of this game should be praised. It controls beautifully the sound and visuals are fantastic the gameplay is fun even when you have no idea what you're doing but it also makes you want to get better so you can start hitting aerial shots or perfecting your centering pass. My only con is on some of the toxic people who play the game as well. You'll have that with any online game though.,Rocket League®

2017-07-10,1,1,496,False,Recommended,I ve never played a game that needed a tutorial less. Association football soccer wendyball whatever you want to call it it s that but on wheels. Drive car at giant ball hit ball into net score points. Rocket League s competitive core has existed for centuries and this helps make a preposterous concept feel primal. This in turn is a laughable way of describing a game which would be called moto carball if it actually existed.Like dry martinis and scribbled in an unattended notebooks Rocket League is a celebration of simplicity. Driving is delicious. Cars ease around like butter in a heated pan but always feel under your control. You accumulate boost by driving over markers on the arena floor and unleash it is a thunderous rush that fires you across over and around the pitch. Because matches take place in smooth enclosed spaces you can drive up walls and across ceilings. Cars can also jump and dodge both of which can be used defensively and offensively. The weight of the cars as well as your ability to apply unruly boost to jumps adds a pleasingly haphazard element like athletic footballers leaping to header high balls but with less shirt pulling and zero chance of flattening a 2000 hairdo.Vehicles feel light and buzzy somewhere between Micro Machines and those swift slidey remote controlled cars which only seem to appear on Christmas Day. This contrasts nicely with the fat beefy bounce of the ball which gormlessly invites impact like a punchable cousin. And that s it. I feel almost guilty reducing a review to ball and car but there are only ever those two things in the field of play and crucially they both feel great. It s helped by a crisp intuitive camera. You can focus on the ball effortlessly whizzing around with it always in view or switch to the standard camera very useful for rushing back to defend your goal or smashing into other vehicles. There are no weapons but certain markers fill your boost and let you obliterate other players. Mercifully it s the generous instantly respawning type of obliteration. Destruction is the only conspicuous deviation from clean business of driving around and scoring goals but in most of the games I played it was a rarity certainly never frequent enough to be irritating.Destroying other vehicles is one of many actions which accumulates points imagine Burnout but with awards for skill not speed. You receive points for things like clearing the ball from your goal line spectacular saves and overhead bicycle kicks named so because the more literal quadracycle wheel nudge is a senseless stew of words. Giving everything a points value means it s about more than scoring goals. The most valuable players I encountered were workmanlike wingers who selflessly chugged along the the flanks crossing the ball for greedy goalhunters like me. It stops players from clustering in the same spots and reinforces the concept that Rocket League is a team game.Except of course when it s not such as when you re duelling against a single opponent. Alternatively you can set teams of four against each other in matches which become so frantic that they re less like footy more like a lost confused beach ball bashed between bumper cars. Playlists of duels doubles standard 3v3 matches and the appropriately named Chaos 4v4 mode are all available online with ranked playlists limited to duels doubles and 3v3. There s a reason why online play is the first option on the menu Rocket League is designed to be played with actual people and this is absolutely where it thrives. My experience was marvellously robust. I rarely had to wait long for a game and if players dropped out mid session they were immediately replaced by AI bots. Best of all it s refreshingly simple to get back into another game so very little time is spent lingering in lobbies.If playing online isn t your thing there are exhibition matches and full seasons you can solo. The length and difficulty can be altered and while it doesn t offer much in the way of depth cars and football remember? I still found myself bonding with pretend teammates. Whether online or offline playing games randomly unlocks new cars and upgrades. These range from simple things like fresh coats of paint and shiny wheels to pointy hats for your wizardmobile. Upgrades are purely cosmetic but volume variety and the promise of driving around with bubbles frothing from your exhaust should be enough to keep you coming back.The offline modes do reveal the game s minor inadequacies however team AI can be flaccid and unreliable especially against tougher opponents and the same simplicity which makes Rocket League immediately playable can cause things to get repetitive when played alone a criticism that only becomes apparent precisely because it s so damn addictive. It s a simple thing done brilliantly well kept interesting by the thrill of competition.,Rocket League®

2015-08-25,0,0,41,False,Recommended,Rocket League This is pretty much soccer with cars. At first it's a hell of a lot of fun and can challenge you in a unique way that you may never have thought before. Eventually you will find that the challenge is to master the art of flying in the air to hit the ball and if you're lucky an aerial goal. This is one of those games that does not have a lot of things to do but you will want to return anyway. It has a decent match making system to pair you up with like skilled players.

2016-03-08,0,0,409,False,Recommended,Rocket League is an intense and thoroughly enjoyable game even for people who hate sports or suck at games.Pros Very fast reaction based game with solid mechanics (you can ing fly!) and a high skill cap. Fun game even when your losing badly (as I often am). Good soundtrack. Nice graphics and art style. Great performance with me having everything maxed 1440p without fps dips below 60. Several game types both ranked (with a fun and rewarding ranking system) and unranked. Good level of car customisation. Some nice cosmetic loot based progression for the first 20 hours. Fairly priced DLC that gives no ingame advantage being purely cosmetic. Splitscreen on PC! ing awesome feature I wish more games had. Cross platform get ready to rekt some PlaySation noobs ) Good support for both controller as well as keyboard and mouse. Reasonably friendly community (there are definitely some s though) with a large player base meaning you will always find games quickly. Cons Some game modes such as 4v4 I find too chaotic and less enjoyable. Bots are dumb and easy to play agaisnt not much use for trying to improve on except for beginner players. Single player is a nice addition but lacks behind other car games campaign modes and isnt as enjoyable as the multiplayer. No support for higher resolutions such as 1440p and 4k in the menus by default (although you can easily fix this by going into the games file and manually changing the resoltution without any issues.). Rare server issues that make collision detection a .Despite naming a few cons these are mostly nitpicks which are greatly outweighed by the overwhelming number of positive features this game has making Rocket League a game I would strongly recommend!,Rocket League®

Moreover I just met with a dude on the Neo Tokyo map who said he want to surrend cause he can't play on the map because of his low FPS so if you don't have the right PC performance to this then don't play it don't even buy it or play on the lowest graphic settings.,Rocket League®

Game graphics I give a high score mechanics are rather snazzy and definitely an enjoyable game all round. Now only thing that I must say that is a little bit on the down side is I did have a tiny bit of lag even choosing Oceanic server's however I was having net troubles I thing during such time so I'm not sure if it's just my internet connection that caused a tiny bit of lag during the 3rd match (3rd match only during near the end) or if it was just the host/whom or whatever that caused it.

2015-08-08,0,0,14,False,Recommended,TO ALL NVIDIA LAPTOP USERS For some reason this game is poorly optmized for laptops with nvdia video cards. I could not get the game to run for over 10 seconds without crashing. Therefore I do not recommend this game if you have a laptop with an nvidia graphics card. However if you really want to play the game and you are willing to sacrifice some gameplay quality I have found a way to run the game on a stable 25 45 fps by tweaking some settings. I am currently plaing on an i7 at 2.00 GHz with a geforce 820m w/ 2 GB and 8 GB of ram. Here is what I did 1. In the 3d graphics settings on the nvidia control pannel I selected Rocket League and chose the nvidia processor (rather than the global configuration) in the graphics processor option.2. Reduced game resolution to be smaller than my screen and changed to borderless rather than full screen.3. Set all in game options to quality rather than high quality*optional I overclocked my cpu with msi afterburner and run razer cortex when playing (might help)Hope this helps.Sorry if there is not an in depth review I just wanted to see if I could help anyone who has trouble running this on a laptop. Still recommend the game though.,Rocket League®

2015-07-31,0,0,84,False,Recommended,After only about 2 hours of gameplay i am already convinced that this game will be one of the most fun multiplayer experiences in 2015. The high speeds crazy goals and the rush of adrenaline as you rush to your own side of the pitch trying to defend your goal is really fun. The splitscreen mode and the option to go online with a buddy in splitscreen doubles the fun in my opinion. This game is definately 20 worth!,Rocket League®
2015-08-08,0,0,77,False,Recommended,I'm not a particularly big fan of football hell i'd rather do anything than watch it on TV so when this game came out I had no intention of buying it. It then started appearing on several of the youtube channels I follow *cough* Markiplier *cough* BYZE *cough cough* and yeah it looked like a lot of fun. Ended up buying it and now i'm bloody hooked! Seriously good fun easy to get into takes a little longer to master the controls though. It plays really well the connection can be pretty sketchy (lag terribly) at the start of some matches but for the majority of the time it runs really well.Definitely worth the money football fan or not you should get this game you wont regret it!,Rocket League®

Jeg likte veldig godt det var så billig til å være helt nytt vanligvis er de nye spillene ganske dyre. Du kan customize din egen bil velge blant visse farger og hatter. Du har forskellige modes du kan spille som f.eks. 1v1 2v2 3v3 4v4 SOLO 1v1 SOLO 2v2 SOLO 3v3 og SOLO 4v4. Det vil komme mange DLCer etterhvert og mange nye biler og baner. Jeg har spilt dette i 3 dager nå og det nok det spillet jeg har spilt mest timer i løpet av 3 dager untatt CS GO som også er et helt magisk spill. Jeg annbefaler dette sterkt! (,Rocket League®

2016-09-27,0,0,27,False,Recommended,"Rocket League is what some would describe it to be a ""soccar"" game that has you commandeering a vehicle and using it to get a ball into the opponent's goal. It's basically ""Crash Course Football"" in a dystopian setting involving nitrous oxide and rocket jumping.The abilties applied are equivalent to that of an acutal footballer/soccer player such as ""Bicycle Hit"". It's more simplified from the typical soccer simulators to perform these abilites since you're driving a ball into your oppenent's goal with your car. Because of these simplified mechanics it allows you to construct even the most spontaneous techniques making for an intense set of games. But the game is difficult to get used to due to its implementation of physics.The customization options are quite accessorizing. You can select from various different cars including the DeLorean and Batmobile if you have the DLC You can alter the colors for the specific teams and you can also select the fuel trail wheels roof accessory and antenna for the car.One of the two special game modes is Hoopz a basketball version of the game that makes it more challenging and skill based for the players. This mode pushes you to utilize advanced ablilties in order to put the ball into the hoop. The other mode is Rumble which involves randomly generated powerups that give you a better advantage of scoring a goal. These powerups include a harpoon freezing the ball and switching places with your oppenent.In conclusion this is most definitive form of soccar to play. This game was build from the very concept of soccar and fully executed into a broader experience giving you addtional ways to play. Despite struggling with it at fiirst this game will be the most fun you'll ever have with friends.",Rocket League®

2015-09-09,0,0,56,False,Recommended,Super fun playing multiplayer. Highly addicting! Customization of cars is good but not very many choices. Haven't used all the cars in the game but most of the ones I've tried have great control. What's tough is trying to time a hit when the ball is in the air I'm always over shooting. Match making is faily quick with most games connecting in less than 30 seconds. It's waiting for others that take a long time when you're just sitting there idling in front of the goal.Overall it's a game I highly recommend. Having a controller is a must.,Rocket League®
2016-12-27,0,0,198,False,Recommended,The best if not only Carball simulator. Pros Hundreds of hours of gameplay and lots of modes to play. Great learning curve you can feel yourself progress every time time you play. DLC is purely cosmetic. Doesn't require a supercomputer to play. Huge player base and cross network play with PS4 players. Great controller support Split screenCons Crates are now pay to open. Servers can sometime be overloaded and cause lag.Rocket League is one of those staple games that anyone with a PC or Console should own. Matches are only 5 minutes and yet they are so much fun. You can jump in for a quick fix or most likely get trapped into the 'One more game' loop and play for hours. An almost perfect game.,Rocket League®

It doesn't offer a ton of content(though patches over the past several months have added things like mutators hockey mode and more recently crazier map designs with rocket labs) but what it does it does very well. Its simple on the surface thanks to straightforward controls and its similarity to real life sports but its very hard to master. This is due to the dynamic nature of the game the near limitless things you can do with your car as well as things like teamplay tactics and general strategy/positioning. This game gives you complete control over what you do with your car and how you hit the ball so making big stops crucial steals and insane goals all feel very satisfying. I personally ended up putting somewhere around 250+ hours across both the PS4 and PC versions of the game over the course of the 8 months or so its been released at the time of this review so I'd say its well worth the price of admission. The servers could be a little better but overall if you've ever seen gameplay of this game and thought ""hey this looks like fun"" I highly recommend checking this game out.",Rocket League®

2016-06-05,0,0,47,False,Recommended,I like this game. It is hard but that makes it so much fun. Some game are too easy to apeal to more people but i think a hard is really rewarding. The cross plaform is a feature that I like. It is kind of a bummer that you can not chat to ps4 user and you can only use quick chat but sony made sure this happened. I can not wait for this game to come to linux so i can play it without using window. This game has competence autonomy and relatedness. Compentence as you are always making progress and when you score or master something it make full of joy. Autonomy is when you have complete control of your choise and the game. You can customize your car choise game modes like hockey and you have control over the ball in free play. Relatedness is when you feel that you matter and you are making a contribution to the game. You feel you matter when you clear the ball save the ball from going in and when you score. when you play multiplayer you feel that you are need and you helped your team win. This game covers the 3 thing to a good game and that makes it apeal to alot of gamers. Alot of people are playing this game and you can play with any platform(pc ps4 and xbox one). This game is fun to play with friend or anyone.,Rocket League®

2016-06-29,0,0,35,False,Recommended,Great Game! Fix your ing ranking system and que system had the game for about an hour and was put against VETERANs and MASTERs. The game itself is amazing however it sucks donky when you get put up against someone who has played since the games release and u have had it for around an hour. i dont give two if there is a season that just ended it make no ing sense. Also it took me about 6 wins to rank up once then i lost one game and div down. The div down would have made sense if i had lost by a lot but im semi pro and was against an EXPERT and lost by 1 goal. Then the following game I div down when i lost in ing OVERTIME against a VETERAN. Honestly its stupid as if i had lost by 3 or even 2 then maybe i would understand but one ing point loss to a player with over 400x my play time (LITERALY) come on wtf. Once again the game itself is great but if you dont like to play against people who have no life when you are brand new to the game then i guess you have to lookup when the ing season didnt just end and play then.,Rocket League®

2016-01-21,0,0,613,False,Recommended,Overall a great game if I were to sum it up I would say it is easy to play but hard to master. There is a certain depth to the game that makes it interesting and fun at teh same time. With this being said the skill cap is very high and I have found that after about 20 hours you can see a marked improvement in your play. If you say this game is bad because you lose all the time please shut up because it is just a game and if you are losing pick up your game. If you lose say gg and do better next time. That is the nature of this game. Some nit picky things that will help in large ways actually hitting the ball often times players go for the ball and swerve left or right too early but with practice this game be avoided the majority of the time knowing when to hit the ball when close to either goal if you are near the enemies goal try to center it for a teamate and if enemies are near your base use common sense centering it isnt always the best idea lastly use your quick chat it will allow for better communication as a team and overall better teamwork.

Highly recommend teaching yourself the right techniques to save yourself and your teammates frustration. Watch the pros compete too you'll learn what works.,Rocket League®

2016-02-12,0,0,176,False,Recommended,This game has some of the most wonderful gameplay i have ever enjoyed. Scoring gives so much satisfaction! In my opinion everything in this game has been done right. The graphics are just right for this type of game not ugly and not too rich or distracting personally i think the game looks awesome. The customization is also a big bonus you can make so many different variations of cars. You never come across with someone looking like you. When you start playing you might find the mechanics difficult as you keep on playing you see however that the learning curve is terrific you can pick up certain moves easily and practicing them quickly helps you get better. What i like the most about this game is that even though it's pvp you don't ever feel any pressure it's a fun casual game even when you are skyping with friends and tryharding to win. Rocket League is also a game that's right for any type of gamer. It doesn't matter if you prefer MOBAs FPS RPG MMO or anything else this game will in every case be a great go to when wanting to play something relaxing and enjoyable. It's the game i have the most fun in when playing and it probably will be for a long time. Honestly everyone should have this game and play from time to time i don't know what other game i would recommend to everyone not even taking in account their tastes.,Rocket League®

2017-09-16,0,0,882,False,Recommended,I was both into and not into Rocket League from the start. Let me explain. I played it for about 10 hours in several couch 2v2 multiplayer split screen sessions and it was instant fun. Total party hit even though none of us were any good at it.But for some odd reason the competitive online play was just something I never considered doing since I figured it would be unpleasant at my ultra low n00b skill level. So I never played online.Until I did and it was fun. And I kept playing. And I keep getting better. The online ranking keeps you playing with and against players in your skill level and this is the thing with a really good esport game like Rocket League the learning curve is really long but not steep. It's instant fun but will take many hundreds of hours (if not thousands) to reach some level of mastery.Be warned you will occasionally bump into toxic chat online but you can disable it or learn to ignore because there are plenty of nice people too. Also if you have kids chances are they will absolutely love playing rocket league too. My 2 sons play this on tv with steamcontrollers on a homebrew steam machine with/against bots (offline local mutliplayer).My only gripe with the game would be that as you get better you'll soon discover you need to start changing your controller layout. They should've fixed that from the start. So I advise you to change the button mapping when playing for the first time. (at least remap powerslide/air roll. google it.)End Verdict highly recommended,Rocket League®

2015-08-13,0,0,25,False,Recommended,I really enjoy this game it has an old skool simplicity about it.Object is simple you just have to get the big ball in the back of the other teams goal using a vehicle and that vehicle can wear a hat. You can jump dash by flipping about and boost using a limited suppy of replenishable boosty nitro type stuff. The graphics are pretty and controls are nice and tight.Sure I'd like to see some options to tweak weight and gravity (ball and cars) here and there to maybe fine tune things to my liking. And I'd like a bit more custommization of AI behaviour and car stats in general to give them some individuality but that's just me. It's a tough one you don't want to unbalance the game by having some vehicles having an advantage over others. But having some with more speed over strength seems like a good way to seperate them cos' as it stands they all seem the same performance wise except that some are physically bigger and therefore that may already give them an advantge over the smaller ones all other things being equal.Anywho this game is fun fluid entertainment easy to pick up hard to master and gets people around the screen in the way games used to years ago... surely a good thing. Maybe you will get a bit tired as there is a lack of different game types/variations. Still it's worth a look.Update This game has had a lot of developer support since my initial rambling. Some of the in game options I had wanted to see are now available. It has new maps and tweaks and just keeps on getting better.,Rocket League®

2016-11-15,1,1,82,False,Recommended,There are two games that I consider to be my favorite games of all time Super Mario World the SNES classic with a heart of gold and gameplay which I still can't quite find anywhere else and Rocket League which fits that exact same build. I have a penchant for games wherein I can jump. SMW's got that obviously 'cause Mario games are about jumping. Rocket League a game about RC cars playing soccer for what I assume are stadiums filled with balloons also has jumping. And aerials. And sick sick stunts. This game looks great feels great and is loads of fun.I originally purchased Rocket League for my PS4 but I sold that so I can get a sick gaming rig and the main reason I considered the switch to be a valid one was because my beloved was still available on the new ship I was choosing to jump to. I still use my PS4 controller which works perfectly with InputMapper so it's like I never left. I do choose to use custom controls as I feel like the standard controls are a bit clunky for aerial play but hey thankfully there's custom controls. It's really a minor complaint.DLC is plentiful and cheap and I never regret making a purchase on something even if I rarely use or equip it simply because Psyonix is constantly pumping out new game modes and arenas as well as providing great support to their users and community on their Rocket League subreddit.,Rocket League®

2016-08-03,1,1,970,False,Recommended,So far as game play is concerned everything is pitch perfect. Where other games rely on an arbitrary skill ceiling to maintain challenges Rocket League's skill ceiling is a variety of creativity reaction time tenacity deceit acrobatics and more. There is truly depth to Rocket League and I can't say that about 80% of the games available today. The purely aesthetic loot system is wonderful. It made taking the game too seriously difficult and subsequently the edgy bad manners players are less prevalent. Though now the loot system is starting too look all too familiar. Introducing a grinding component to acquiring loot as opposed to more liberally distributing loot. I suppose the hat on my car doesn't actually matter and they haven't touched the core game play but the intention behind implementing a more grind like loot system is step one in creating a market that threatens to consume the rest of the game. The moment options are taken away to stimulate more loot value that thumbs up is turning into a thumbs down and I'll write a new review from my adobe yurt in the Himalayas as the last thing I ever loved was gobbled up by laissez faire capitalism.,Rocket League®

In Player vs AI mode you compete against up to seven opponents to try to stop your computer controlled teammates from driving the ball all the way from the enemy goal line straight into your own goal. In Player vs Player mode helpful mentors within the community will recommend you not play the game at all because Rocket League like fencing and squash is a game of elites and a sport of which the underclasses are unworthy. The last game mode is my favorite in which you peacefully drive around a field alone with the ball for a few minutes while waiting for your audience with the Bronze Ranked Queue House of Lords.10/10 would drive around an empty field alone again,Rocket League®

All cars have equal sized hitboxes and equal sized boost capacity. One of the few games where the only difference between winning and losing is skill. There's no theorycrafting no spreadsheets no lame stats etc. Just plain fun.The only letdown is that it's a bit of a wild west as far as cheating is concerned. One of the problems I've particularly encountered is what I can best describe as 'multiboxing' as in World of Warcraft where one player controls more than one character simultaneously. Often leads to a very unfair advantage. Also it would be great if there were a feature to report AFK players and offensive player nicks.,Rocket League®

Awesome to play in solo queue even better with your mates.

Slightly mild learning curve at first but once u get the physics and the vehicles controls down the rest just comes naturally.One thing I would recommend for me using a console controller just felt a lot easier for controlling thr vehicles compared to a mouse &amp keyboard combo.

2015-10-02,1,1,214,False,Recommended,Rocket League is a really enjoyable game and I would recommend it to anyone who is a pretty big fan of soccer stunts and cars in general. The graphics are up to par as well as the actual gameplay itsself. The game great because of its versatile range of gameplay and the small amount of trolls I personally have encountered in the community. The game includes many different gamemodes such as hockey basketball etc. It also allows you to change the settings(i.e. speed of your car size of the ball and level of gravity) in multiplayer mode with friends and the ranking system is decently accurate. All in all the game is fantastic the next big thing.,Rocket League®

The game is as serious as you want it to be and equally as comical as you can imagine cars and soccer to be. Even before the rumble addition had been added this game was addicting.

The collection of parts is addictive with customisation being fun each DLC adds enough parts to change how you can look in a variety of ways.Team colours are are reduced for pratical sake but secondary paint colours are enough to fill any belly. Yes yes Black aswel. After playing this long enough black wont be enough.Most DLC has extra cars with them these cars usually have new paint jobs for just them. So dont expect Flames to be for every car.Parts Car Paint colours Hats radio Antenna ends Wheels Rocket Stream.Each part is unlocked as you play usually one per match. sometimes there'll be even only items for example Halloween had some bits you will only see from players who played at that time.Just think Nitro on an RC car.,Rocket League®

Always a way to improve. Always a new challenge. No two games are the same.Psyonix is the most active and engaging developer team out there.

2017-07-24,0,0,661,False,Recommended,Addictive game. Great gameplay servers are typically good the business model has gotten worse with time. Putting cars in the crates is obnoxious although I'm sure it brings more money in. Hopefully they're working on a new game as one can only be a one trick pony for so long even though it's an incredibly COMPELLING one trick pony.Protip turn off crates in settings before you're even tempted.

2017-06-19,1,1,912,False,Recommended,I've heard greatness of this game and so I decided to try it. I myself usually play MMO's or FPS' but I had to give this a shot. Little did I know that I was getting myself into a new addiction.The games are usually very short but very face paced so you can play multiple games within an hour easily. The gameplay itself is very unique and smooth kind of like Hot Wheels or Twisted Metal (without the weapons) meets soccer/football. It's very tricky to get used to at first but once you do you'll want to better yourself and play more and more.There is a TON of car customization and loads of different cars to choose from in this great game. From cute little puppies on your roof to snake eyes on your rims! Most items are earned through random drops rewarded to those that complete their games. There are however crates for those that want to spend a few bucks and maybe get something more but again you can get most things in game via end game rewards. The only gripe that I have is that the servers sometimes don't put you into a match this isn't around your rank. You can be Pro/Expert and play with Rookies or vise versa. Other than that this game is absolutely great unique fun and I highly recommend it to anyone out there!...........................................................................................................TL DRPros+ Emmersive gameplay+ Casual &amp Competitive gamemodes+ Friendly community+ Lots of car customization+ Great soundtracks+ Amazing car handling and air mechanics+ Holiday/E sports events+ Developers really listen to the communityCons Servers are sometimes slow to respond and give poor performance (EU) Can be placed in a game with much higher ranks as a noobRating 4.5 / 5,Rocket League®

No my friend. This is not just any tea. This is a bottomless pit of chai picked from bright tropical rainbow fields. The steering is exquisite imagine delicately picking tea leaves with a humvee's grill with your tire treads spawning a billion new seedlings yet crushing none. Imagine the humvee runs on raw spices its smoke an aromatic blend of cinammon cardamon nutmeg and cloves. Imagine the humvee is filled with an oxygenated mass of ginger and lemon that you can float and breathe in and now you are flipping the tea leaves by flipping your fat humvee 720 degrees you are weightless and not remotely ill. Now you hop you leap and you are flying through the air. You're in a rocketship humvee and you're not as free as a bird but those tea leaves they are yours. And sometimes not there are others floating about making tea and sometimes they steal a sip of yours and vice versa but you don't mind at all in no small part because none of you are remotely milk intolerant and the clouds are branded A2 proteins. The heavens are raining warm honey milk down upon you your humvee is burping steam through the leaves and you are on a planet of foaming chai latte.That is Rocket League.,Rocket League®

2016-11-27,0,0,156,False,Recommended,It's 3v3 soccer (futsal?) with rocket cars a match made in heaven. Success depends on a mix of technical skill reading the opponents and common sense strategy. At the same time there's plenty of chaos nobody can control the ball forever anyone can put the ball in the goal and an amazing play can happen at any time. The controls feel great and offer a wide range of motion riding up walls high speeds and even flight...after some practice. Player eliminations (executed by hitting an opponent at full speed) aren't rewarded or condoned in any way by themselves but sometimes they're exactly what you need to win.Rocket League was my favorite game the month it launched and it's still getting better every month. It's great alone online and even in local multiplayer. Essential Steam.,Rocket League®

2015-10-27,0,0,90,False,Recommended,A very simple game with a very simple concept something that most modern day multiplayer games lack but Rocket League excels at. As a football (soccer) fan this game does incredibly well to capture the drama and emotion of the beautiful game. I've had games where my team was 4 0 down with 2 minutes left only to turn it around and win 5 4 with the last shot going in at the 05 mark. On the flip side we've conceded last second goals in ranked that left everyone questioning their existence. On top of this the developers have not dissapointed with the super cheap DLC! Which is of course optional and does not have any impact on gameplay if you choose not to purchase. The first flawless cross platform matchmaking I've seen. Take note EA some developers do care. This game brings about the same feelings I had for Super Mario Strikers back in the day. Just about as good as a simple multiplayer game can get. Play it with your friends and you're bound to have some laughs talk some trash and score some amazing goals.,Rocket League®
2015-08-06,0,0,2008,False,Recommended,WARNING!!! Cross platform play does NOT mean you can party with your friend's to play with on PS4. I bought the game because I have many friends on PS4 that play and I have no way of playing with them. Quite disappointed.,Rocket League®

2016-01-01,0,0,3,False,Recommended,Rocket League is the third installment in Nickelodeon's hit series Rocket Power. The kids having been in a fatal accident and being amputees they pursue the only reasonably radical sport they can soccer with cars. The players are divided into two teams bodacious blue and osogood orange and together players fight over big balls. The game is quite good but however sometimes it becomes a bit frustrating when you don't get the gnarly score you thought you'd get because of some whack attack physics. If you're like me and you don't wanna fool cuz you're cool I'd reccomend that you shred on this game with a homie g. This game is meant to be enjoyed with a ploy for friends to the end ya dig.

It allows you to move in more than eight directions that a keyboard gives you and also allows more camera options in game.As for the game itself I find it a load of fun even though I suck at it.

Most games that have been out for many years are more buggy then this game that was released a mere week ago. As somebody who is not really into soccer this game pulls you in and makes you play for hours at a time. The game looked boring at first but when I began to play it I threw that idea away instantly. Pros + Some of the best co op play ever.+ Amazingly competitive gameplay.+ Some of the fastest matchmaking I have ever witnessed.+ Great servers.+ Awesome customization of your car.+ Cross compatibility with the Ps4.+ Great controller support.+ Very clean game no crashes or bugs ever witnessed.+ Sweet graphics. Cons That annoying vuvuzela sound at the beginning of games. Once you unlock all items for the cars game becomes a tad bit stale. Please for the love of all that is holy buy this game.

Rocket League has full controller support even for PS4 controllers. No complex stuff just plug it in and start playing! In rocket league You have many beginner cars to choose from and you can customize them to your liking. Over a period of time You will get crates that you can open and get an item. It can either be a rare item very rare item import item exotic item or a mystery decal. The higher item type the more it is worth.

Even if you do not have any experience with this type of game you should be able to pick up the basics generally very quickly.

2015-07-09,0,0,492,False,Recommended,I honestly can't say anything negative about this game. I can wholeheartedly recommend it throughout on all aspects. The servers are well established and allows cross play from PS4 and PC. The mechanics in the game are flawless and I see no bugs. This game has A TON of potential for ups for sick moments and for hilarious moments. You won't regret buying this game whether you're alone or a group.,Rocket League®
2016-03-19,0,0,453,False,Recommended,Now that i have finally reached 100 hours in this game i feel i can finally give a good review of it. Rocket League is a game that has the old school gaming feel where you can just start the game and within seconds be connected to a game really good for the pick up and play if you dont have much time. Playing by yourself can be dull at time given that you sometimes may be paired up with people that are too good or people that like goofing around which can cause the game to be stressful. When you play competitive this gives you a whole new reason to not fool around and play serious because the matches and points matter that is what i mostly play on. Playing with people from your friends list can add a huge amount of fun to the game because you are playing with them more and more over time and then you start to build that team chemistry and then the real fun begins. All in all this game is good when you are pressed for time but this game can also cut into your other games because this game can be so fun and you constantly will lose track of time. Overall this game is a solid 9/10 for the price point and the hours you can play it is a massive positive and well worth the money. Get it and go out and get your boost on.,Rocket League®
2015-12-01,0,0,503,False,Recommended,This game is very well optimized and it works even on a weak PC.

2015-12-26,0,0,25,False,Recommended,not only does this game look really good but it can also run a potato. just to prove this here are my system specs AMD Athlon X2 II 240 2.80 4 gigs of RAM Nvidia Geforce GTX 650 2 gig WIndows 10 OS. the GPU is about the only thing that is not from 2009/2010 on this old computer and the game runs really well on maxed settings which could mean that it is very GPU dependent. Now on to the game play the game is simple your a car and you must play a very weird version of soccar. when driving around destroying other cars hitting the ball around or making goals you will a get a huge sense of hype and excitment. you will find your self boosting yourself up and down the arenas causing massive chaos just to get a big ball full of gas in a goal. the hectic nature of the game takes several notes from actual sports like soccar and hockey and transforms it into a crazy arcade like sci fi sport i would expect to only see in a 90's action movie.

2015-09-26,0,0,1790,False,Recommended,"Over 1000 hours invested now... and Rocket League has fallen into the trap that most games of this era seem to have fallen into. They are growing too fast for their own skin and are trying to juggle too many things at once.When it was launched Rocket League was an extremely solid game that had little to no bugs or glitches or connection problems. It was just a reliable and fun game that I could count on. Now that it has blown up in popularity and has become an offical ""E Sport"" I feel the developer Psyonix has lost sight of its roots. Like every single solitary game that's available today Rocket League decided that microtransactions in the form of randomly obtainable crates that require keys to open for $1 each was the way it was going to make it's income. This is a good business model with the exception that they don't seem to be focusing on the core aspects of the game anymore namely the rock solid continuity that used to exist in the game before it's extreme popularity. More and more I find myself going for a shot and the ball travels right through my car like it was never there. This is even backed up by the in game replay of goals showing the trail that's left behind the ball after a player makes contact being skewed showing that something happened at that point but was ultimately ignored. The most recent Championship Series had a $250 000USD prize pool which leaves me wondering why they don't spend that money on keeping their servers maintained and in perfect working order. I really do love this game more than any game I've loved in the past and I want to see it continue to grow but I fear Psyonix is on the wrong path currently. They seem to be trying to emulate Counter Strike Global Offensive with the way they are doing things now. Focused more on creating more avenues for microtransactions than actually ensuring their game is playable by the people who will keep coming back.All in all still a fantasic game and I will still try to keep a positive attitude towards the future of this game. I just hope they realize that theres more to it than microtransactions. 80hrs later and I finally write a review of this one. If you haven't played it yet then just do. It's such a fantasic game I can't even explain it in words. Sure I hear you ""It's soccer with cars"" and yeah you're right. BUT! It's soooo much more than just than. If you're either a soccer fan a car fan OR BOTH you'll know that neither is simple yet both are awesome in their own right! So imagine that both are super awesome and are colliding like 2 huge galaxies of epicness making a massive spectical of amazing..... that's Rocket League. Buy it. Play it. Love it.

Highly recommend some kind of controller (I chose wired Xbox360) which is unusual for me. This is the first game I've come across where the experience is markedly better with a controller vs mouse and keyboard.

Even though the levels are pretty much the same and the cars can only be upgraded on their cosmetics its the simplicity and depth that make this game shine. Matches of 5 minutes make the game very intense and scoring some skill goals or blocking some insane shots are satisfying. For me its worth the price.

2015-11-12,0,0,32,False,Recommended,Rocket League is a highly addictive game due to its mix of football and cars it isnt specific in its audience so anyone can enjoy it. Car customization is great allowing for a unique player look. It is quick to pick up and it takes time to build up the skill to be great at timing your shots and doing tricks etc. I would say that it is more of a game you would play for half an hour or so rather than long runs as it can get repetitive but it takes time for the novelty to wear off and it is something I seriously recommend playing for a laugh with friends.,Rocket League®

2016-01-16,0,0,61,False,Recommended,Rocket League is easily one of the best games of 2015. I've never had this much fun in a game in awhile. Rocket League brings something totally new to the table soccer with RC cars. Pure Genius.Rocket League is such a simple game to learn but such a hard game to master. There are tons of different moves you can learn how to do and master. It would seem by the idea of hitting a huge ball with an RC car that is all a bunch of randomness but there actually is a method to all this madness. Rocket League also does have a ranking system there are ranked games and un ranked games. You also have your own personal level that classifys you as either a Rookie Semi Pro Pro Veteran Expert Master Legend and finally the Rocketeer.Rocket League also offers tons of different visual upgrades for your cars thatr you can earn by completing games. There are many different types of bodies to choose from as well as different boost trails flags toppers different types of paints and decals.Rocket League offers so much content for such a low price and has many different DLC to get also which can improve your experience even more. Rocket definitely deserves a 10/10 and a recommended from me!,Rocket League®

2017-05-07,0,0,15,False,Recommended,Product received for free. Rocket League is an amazing game. You should totally buy it if you have the money. Even though I don't have it I will buy it if the price goes down. Otherwise 20$ is a little expensive for me but most people in this world are rich so they will probably buy it right away. Once you get good at the game it's totally fun but if you are new to this game and keeep on ball chasing then it may not be as fun. You need to be willing to put time into this game but if you can't put that much time into this game then don't buy it. I really reccomend a controller because it ehances your experience. Keyboard and mouse was very confusing controls but that's just me.,Rocket League®
2016-07-22,0,0,134,False,Recommended,Even if you don't care about sports or racing this game is so fast paced and zany that you can't help but want to play one more match. It can be difficult to pick up at first and I really do recommend you do the practice sessions first so you can acquaint yourself with how to move your vehicle around the best way. You'll probably fumble a lot trying to hit the ball at all let alone accurately. The great thing about this game though is that it's always fun even if you suck. Playing the game with friends is highly recommended too as it absolutely doubles the fun and I really like how matchmaking takes parties into account to assure you'll be on the same team as your friends in online play.The one thing that I'll complain about is that the AI can still do really dumb things even if you're playing at higher skill levels I have seen some bots just casually drive the ball into their own goal for no reason. It can be quite frustrating to play offline if you're essentially carrying your team.I should also mention that if you're ever starting to get bored of the standard arenas I highly recommend you try some of the rocket lab arenas to completely change things up. It seems right now that not many people play on them but I promise you they are worth it and demand a whole new strategy and style of play.,Rocket League®

Beginners will have fun but when you start pulling off crazy moves like rocket jumps and saves it gets pretty exciting. The game has tons of unlockables to keep you interested but honestly it's just extra because the gameplay is where this game really shines. It's fun to play alone but a blast to play with friends plus it has split screen co op if you have multiple controllers and while you can play with a mouse and keyboard i highly suggest using a controller.Graphically the game looks amazing sharp graphics and effects vibrant colors. Plus it is optimized really well i'm pretty sure you could run this game on a microwave.Don't think my 11 hours played mean anything i bought the game 2 weeks ago and i'm going to keep coming back to it for a long time.

2016-12-05,0,0,53,False,Recommended,Rocket League is possibly one of the best games I ever played on Steam! As I keep on returning to it as much As I can!It is a fast paced game were you play as a mini car and make attempts to score against the enemy team similar to real sports like soccer hockey and basketball! And this is coming from a guy who doesn't care much about sports! But the game is so engaging that I just can't help myself but to play! But on the other hand this game can be repetitive at times and can cause eye strain if you play for too long! The season mode also kind of stinks.

2016-04-03,1,1,639,False,Recommended,"Fair warning I was mostly just thinking out loud when I wrote this down .Seriously there's zero learning curve. (XBOX 360 controller) So to perform a proper kick flip in rocket league you hit A to jump angle yourself by pressing forwards or back on the joystick and hitting A again. For an air boost. if you're ever out of boost simply kick flipping repeatedly can get you going just as fast as full boost and in a shorter distance.I thought a kick flip was just a front flip until I experimented with it. Pvp is stupid easy if you kick flip all over the place. Someone added me to steam earlier cause ""you play like a lunatic"" Apparently it's not normal to see someone kick flipping for boost speeds and blocks or shots. I have yet to run into someone who uses their full boost at first ball and kick flip into it.10/10 so far able to get first touch by kick flipping out of boost. Sometimes I get solid goals out of first touch cause they don't expect that kind of power behind the ball. Kick flipping straight out of boost is so OP. You can basically travel with the ball and air whip it with x a second time to shoot it anywhere you want. People leave so quick when they see it. The rage is real.I thumbs up this game cause it's a lot of fun the challenge is decent the graphics are pretty and the gameplay is top notch. I will however voice that I wish there weren't so many people who shoot the ball into our own goal. I mean c'mon guys...",Rocket League®

Seriously though this game is fantastically addictive and is one of those titles that you'll find yourself loading up for a couple minutes just to play a round or two before leaving the house for the day. Awesome game play with solid graphics for the genre however you really do need a controller in order to play the game properly so keep that in mind before buying.,Rocket League®
2017-07-19,0,0,206,False,Recommended,This is probably the best game I have ever played I'm hooked. Its competetive mode doesn't take nearly as much time as say CS GO or LoL and it's perfect for eSports. A player who has never played or heard of the game can easily watch and understand a tournament where very good players are competing. (Unlike games such as LoL) Even when you think you're really good there's always someone who discovers another hard and useful thing to know. 11/10 would post this review again,Rocket League®

2016-07-08,0,0,1479,False,Recommended,"This is by far my favorite multiplayer game on any platform. I first took site of this game in september of 2015 when i saw it basically ""storm"" the youtube gaming page so i looked and saw it was only on Playstation/PC. I was distraught because I only had an xbox at the time. I wanted to see if there was a way to port it over but no dice. I eventually just decided to wait until I had enough money to buy a gaming pc so i did. D around january I had enough from christmas with the relatives and my savings to buy an Alienware and what was the first thing I did? Sent it back because it had a faulty server connector but what did I do when i got the second computer? I went onto steam and got Rocket league D I played it for I believe 10 hours before going to bed then playing it again the next morning. I played it for about a month when low and behold Rocket League comes out on Xbox which both made me mad and made me laugh. I had JUST got the game (for a month or so). I just laughed it off and played more and more. I got enough money to buy all the dlc (all except NBA flags which wasnt out at the time but who cares). The game has gotten better ever since with hoops Rocket Labs more cars more maps more awesomeness! This game gets an 11/10... ney a 6 stars out of 5... ney an ""I r8 9/8"" from a tumblr addict.... NEY it gets my gratitude and my respect (plus all the stuff i said and a thumbs up recommendation). This game has inspired me to make a trickshot vine (It's_MagicRL) to which im not very good but I'm at least trying and I have hit decent things. I love this game and I dont think I'll ever stop playing it. Cheers! D It's_Magic/MagicBraden1",Rocket League®

The overall ambiance is well done and the game looks good without blowing out your computer (that's Unreal Engine to you).One slightly bad thing is that this game almost require you to have friends most of online randoms are jerks (would rather write insults in the chat instead of scoring points spams taunts when they score goals then blame luck when it's your turn) and the bots are incredibly unbalanced and not fun to play with (can score a long shot goal across the map while driving backwards and then will stop in front of a free goal just because they can on the same match).But the update gets better everytime I highly reccomand this game if you're sure you have friends to play with.,Rocket League®

2016-08-18,0,0,578,False,Recommended,Rocket League is a fantastic game simple as that. As a whole the community you find is generally supportive the devs are kind and the product is unbeatable. I can't say enough good things about RL from the matchmaking to the customization to the indescribable feeling of joy when you hit that Long Pool Shot in Overtime to take the win for your team... it is exhilarating. The learning curve is steep but you can FEEL yourself getting better and making plays that you wouldn't have been able to make just a few hours prior.It is absolutely without a doubt worth the $20 price point and you will get way more out of it than some $60 main titles.**I would highly reccomend picking this game up during the fall sale! An absolute steal at just over 10 dollars. The new item and crate system is very simple and fair and it supports awesome events like the RLCS which I for one greatly enjoy. With the new rumble mode arena and achievements there is always something new to do because the game is still under expansion and everything is done perfectly. I have since recruited three friends into playing as well... and that is pretty extraordinary.,Rocket League®

I play with friends most of the time and I think that's the best way to play it but still if you play solo you can still have fun or eventually find people and make friends to play together. Overall this a fun game to play while you learn how to get better everytime.9/10Update Been playing this for almost a year now I think and it is still super awesome.

2015-09-22,1,1,15,False,Recommended,Great game you really should try Apple Pie. RecPIE For the filling1kg Bramley apples140g golden caster sugar½ tsp cinnamon3 tbsp flourFor the pastry225g butter room temperature50g golden caster sugar plus extra2 eggs350g plain flour preferably organicsoftly whipped cream to serve ( Really recomend the whipped cream)1.Put a layer of paper towels on a large baking sheet. Quarter core peel and slice the apples about 5mm thick and lay evenly on the baking sheet. Put paper towels on top and set aside while you make and chill the pastry.For the pastry beat the butter and sugar in a large bowl until just mixed. Break in a whole egg and a yolk (keep the white for glazing later). Beat together for just under 1 min it will look a bit like scrambled egg. Now work in the flour with a wooden spoon a third at a time until it s beginning to clump up then finish gathering it together with your hands. Gently work the dough into a ball wrap in cling film and chill for 45 mins. Now mix the 140g/5oz sugar the cinnamon and flour for the filling in a bowl that is large enough to take the apples later.After the pastry has chilled heat the oven to 190C/fan 170C/gas 5. Lightly beat the egg white with a fork. Cut off a third of the pastry and keep it wrapped while you roll out the rest and use this to line a pie tin 20 22cm round and 4cm deep leaving a slight overhang. Roll the remaining third to a circle about 28cm in diameter. Pat the apples dry with kitchen paper and tip them into the bowl with the cinnamon sugar mix. Give a quick mix with your hands and immediately pile high into the pastry lined tin.Brush a little water around the pastry rim and lay the pastry lid over the apples pressing the edges together to seal. Trim the edge with a sharp knife and make 5 little slashes on top of the lid for the steam to escape. (Can be frozen at this stage.) Brush it all with the egg white and sprinkle with caster sugar. Bake for 40 45 mins until golden then remove and let it sit for 5 10 mins. Sprinkle with more sugar and serve while still warm from the oven with softly whipped cream.Recipe from Good Food magazine October 2004,Rocket League®
2016-11-24,0,0,346,False,Recommended,Rocket League just scratches that itch y'know? It hits that point of bite sized gameplay that's not too long to get boring but long enough to feel satisfying. Then it takes that bite size polishes the ever loving hell out of it and publishes it.I believe that most people will enjoy this game. I have never enjoyed Football Cars or highly competitive games and yet when the three are combined in this mental moshpit of a video game it just works.Is it worth 15? It might not seem that way at face value but if you trust the game enough to buy it you'll recieve an incredibly rewarding and hilariously satisfying game that you can just keep coming back to.It's not without it's negatives. The AI although challenging to entry level players becomes hilariously inept after a good 50 or so hours in and I do disapprove of the crate and key system but my hundreds of hours in game should prove that it hasn't really bothered me enough to make me stop playing.Rocket League is fast paced addictive and definitely worth picking up ESPECIALLY on sale!,Rocket League®

2017-07-03,0,0,30,False,Recommended,Rocket League what can you ask from a simple soccer cars game more than just a clock a ball and two goals?Well apparently there are alot of great features and extrea abilities to just to upgrade the gameplay and make it more fun.The Ranking system is.. ok? well yeah there alot of ranks which makes the the game more fair for players who achieved a good handful of knowledge but sometimes people are just better than you in any rank because they are just stuck in it. But i guess that's about it. The controls are awesome and if you'll keep playing the game you will soon get used to it. There's a voice chat in game but i don't recommend using it since it can be a distruction for you and maybe the other team too.In Conclusion this game is really cool and it has a nice community but in the end you will lose the interest in it.,Rocket League®

2017-07-03,0,0,1028,False,Recommended,After playing this game for 2 years across PC and PS4 the fact that I've never written a review is a real tragedy. Not that this game needs any more endorsements but it by far the most fun game I've ever played in my 22 years of gaming. There are so many great things about this game and I'm not that into sports. The sheer amount of ways to play this game are incredible and I don't feel like it ever gets old. Flying around the field trying to hit a ball seems mundane but it once you get the hang of flying it becomes so much more. I follow this game as an e sport I watch pros play it when I can't I play it with my son and I generally think about it when I'm not playing it. The biggest criticism I'd have of it is the crate system. I'm not a huge fan of gambling and trying to get a crate with something good in it is like trying to win the lottery. The drop rates are so low that you'd be better off just trading keys with other people for items you really want. But lately I've just been playing stock cars because flashy items don't make you play better. This game is constantly getting updated with new stuff and the stadiums are always free. They support is very good and I don't foresee myself leaving the game any time soon.,Rocket League®

2016-06-30,0,0,82,False,Recommended,"Rocket League is a game that I didn't even know that I wanted.The games premise couldn't be more simple play a game of soccer while piloting a car with a rocket booster strapped to the back. While that may look and sound gimmicky from the outside I can all but guarantee you just five minutes of game play with your favorite controller will turn even the most stubborn skeptic into a believer.The game succeeds because it is easy enough for anybody to pick up and play but the unbelievable skill ceiling will keep you coming back to it. Since the game is entirely physics based your demonstration of timing and skill will be what sets you apart from your opponents. If you play enough you will actually feel yourself becoming a better player.The game features a quick play option as well as a robust ranked competitive play option. And if you don't feel like competing against other players the game also has a ""season"" mode where you can play by yourself or with AI teammates against other AI teams in a tournament style system.With a dozen different cars and (potentially) hundreds of cosmetic items you can even customize your car to fit your unique personality.There's a reason you've heard about this game. You can believe the hype 100%. And if you haven't heard of this game do yourself a favor and pick it up. In a world of pixel based RPGs and repetitive first person shooters Rocket League is refreshing palette cleanser for your library.EDIT it's roughly six months later and I still think this game is amazing.",Rocket League®

2016-12-21,0,0,2158,False,Recommended,This game is truely amazing. At first when you start playing its hard to follow and even hit the ball. Many own goals will pass (and still they will come at a higher level) once you figure out the controls and how to hit the ball in your advance. Then comes the first goal. Feels amazing doesnt it? It will only get better from now. Its when you make a series of goals that you think i could do this prettier...There where goals are are goalies to defend the goal from happening. It might be even more important to keep goals from happening on your side than to score on the opposite site. Hitting the ball out of the goal isnt enough the opponement might still be able to hit the ball you just cleared towards the goal unsaveable for you... shame... The trick is to not only defend the goal but also to defend the rebound. Its always easier to keep a tie than to work your way up from a possible defeat. This defending however might require the following Aerial gameplay comes in now. Not only hitting the ball in the air but using that hit to your advance to play to a teammate or perhaps even to yourself that you will continue the aerial play. Defending aerially isnt too hard... Just try to shoot at your own goal but way too hard and high works for me every time.Now that skill is aquired you can perfect those skills to your advance and work your way up the ranked ladder to eventually hit grand champion. Every win feels deserved (kind of) and every loss... well a loss. Be mindfull of your teammates as they can be a little unpredictable.After 1300 hours i can truely say that i enjoy the game and still look forward to play a game every single day.,Rocket League®

2017-05-07,0,0,17,False,Recommended,I had this game for the free weekend I noticed a few bugs and glitches while playing it. For starters if you are playing rumble and get the spike power up if you catch the ball on the side of your car you cannot move. Another one is if you happen to get disconnected from a game and you are in a party if the game becomes full you have to leave the party and join back in. If you try to wait it will show that you are not in the party and you cantuse the group chat also. The last thing I found was if you are using a controller and you accidentely hit one of the keys on the keyboard your car will stop working with the controller you have to go to the menu and hit controls than hit any button on the controller for it to work. Overall the game was very well set up and designed and I would definetly buy it (if i wasnt a broke scrub),Rocket League®

2017-04-05,0,0,41,False,Recommended,What is a review if not the writer's personal opinion on the subject so here's what I think about this game after //30'something hours later into it. Started to get used with the standard mouse+keyboard controls it's possible to play that way and have fun so don't get dissapointed if you don't have a gamepad. Kept on playing with the Ice Charger DLC car I got so used to it I simply switch it to other car without having a feeling weird. But... I'm starting to get irritated by some things that keep happening... The item drops for example. I did get a nice pair of wheels and booster from that pay to open boxes but that's ALL that I can use on my car from like 10 boxes I've opened so far. Also most of the time I get these common items again and again and again. The rewarding system feels empty after a while.Also the player base... I mean rarely you find someone that curses in the chat but every time you have that player in the team that hits your car all the time f**ks up your shots and your experience over all. I'm getting tired of that please if you read this be carefull about your team mates.,Rocket League®

Better play ranked when you have learnt the basics.Excellent jeu sur lequel passer plusieurs centaines d'heures (fa ci le) bonne courbe de progression on progresse vraiment d'heure en heure au début et c'est toujours jouissif de faire des moves de fou ses premiers aerials et j'en passe. Possibilité également de faire des matchs en changeant les paramètres genre ballon carré boost x10 des barres de rire en perspective !Dans les défauts la commu est pas toujours top (beaucoup de taunts les insultes sont pas rares suffit de bloquer les rageux ou de leur coller 10 0) et le mode non ranked voit souvent des gens arriver et partir sans prévenir.

2015-07-08,1,1,90,False,Recommended,Game about rocketpowered near to fully customisizable cars playing over the top soccer with non of the usual rule strings attached. It's a blast. Singleplayer offers Training/Exhibition and a long Season mode against bots who are actually fun to play against. Played 1v1 2v2 3v3 (standard and in my opinion best) 4v4.Multiplayer ist the meat of the game though. Creating parties lobbies with friends or juust playing with random people works amazingly well. Left open spots can be filled with bots. This game allows cross platform play between PC and PS4.Worth the 20$ asking price and FREE on PSPlus if you are inclined that way and just want to try it out or play it for 2 hours with the Steam Refund Policy.

At the moment my heart was crushed just like my legs and I started to cry like a lil . But however when I got home my friend told me about this game called Rocket League. I was like what is a ""Rocket"" what is a ""League"" he told me to buy this game because it was on sale and I said oh well if I can't use my feet might as well use my hands for better things besides busting nuts. When I first got into the game I knew exactly what I wanted to be. I wanted to be a CAR. I found the game so exciting and the concept was so thrilling that I wanted to be the game itself.

2016-08-23,0,0,106,False,Recommended,When my friend recommended a game that involved both football (soccer) and cars two things I'm lukewarm about at best I figured this game might be fun for a couple hours and then would be forgotten in the depths of my Steam library like some artifact that an underpaid archaeologist might find amongst all the other garbage and waste. So flash forward to 37 hours of gameplay at this posting and...I was wrong.I'm not in the habit of giving games 10/10 reviews. In fact I can't think of a single game deserving of a 10/10 aside from those gilted by the mystical touch of nostalgia. The thing is though that Rocket League sets out to do one thing one simple thing and it does it perfectly. There are elements to the game that I find superfluous like the add on car bundles and different game modes (but I can avoid those). However the physics of the ball and vehicles are top notch and the multiplayer experience is absolutely spot on. Playing with friends is a blast particularly when you come up against some whiner that decides that the best option when loosing 5 to 3 is to rage quit in the last 10 seconds. That's ace. Few games have such memorable moments of scoring ridiculous goals or making a crazy series of events transform into something unexpected and wonderful. It's the only game I've bothered saving a replay of for instance.Anyway there are other things to be said but if you need much more prodding just think about the productive things you COULD be doing instead of playing this game and then be like me procrastinate and tell yourself 'just one more round'.,Rocket League®

Rocket league is a car game which plays like the sport of soccer (or football but who cares) and has beuatiful graphics which isnt that hard to run surprisingly (over 60 fps at 720p on a low end build with high graphics). The gameplay is extremely straight forward but is very conplicated to learn and master the tricks. Honestly anyone could play this game. My only complaint is the pc controls.

2016-12-24,0,0,1739,False,Recommended,"For start I recommend it to everyone. It is not age restricted literally anyone can have fun with it. It's just like a sport. No money involved no ""pay to win"" / ""no pay no play"" an that stuff. Sure you can buy items to look better but no items affect the game. As I said it's like a sport meaning the more you practice the better you get so the game is fair and everyone is equal. Mostly for that reason I love it because the only thing that defines your skill is the number of hours played and practiced. Every match is 5 minutes of pure fun unless you're salty in which case I recommend you some fries instead of game lol. The only thing I dislike is community because the vast majority playes the mind tricks trying to get you angry so that you can't perform at best but that's not developer's fault so no problem there with the game itself just the people who can't really have fun. Remember it's a game it's meant to bring people together to smile together. If you're looking for fun and not being 100% competitive always this is a game for you! Enjoy it!",Rocket League®

Nothing more satisfying than flying all the way accross the field in a rocket powered van. Very competitve feel to it but also is very fun if you're just playing it casually. Cross platform compatibility with PS4 makes it even better so there are more people to play with.Highly recommended and worth the $20.,Rocket League®

2015-08-19,0,0,605,False,Recommended,The joy of Rocket League rests on the countless plans that are conceived and discarded every other second in any given match. Trying to predict where and how the ball will bounce next is a game within the game. Despite the use of cars Rocket League emulates the emotional surges typical of The Beautiful Game such as the rush of an unexpected fast break or a well timed header into a goal. With Rocket League the promising concept of combining two wonderful things cars and soccer is equally magnificent in execution. You can't say the same thing about say combining cake and fruit to make fruitcake it is in a league of its own. Extremeley enjoyable both solo or with friends.,Rocket League®

It's fun there is a ton of customisation there are many many trades going on where you can trade all the decals and wheels and whatever else... And trust me once you start to consistently hit aerials and start to score some ""sick"" goals you're definetely not going to stop soon.Long story short If you wanna play soccer but you're tired of FIFA then this is a real nice approach on football highly skill and team oriented and here for hours over hours of enjoyment.

First may I say that the game is a very different experience when you play with a different skill group. Starting off from most shots being taken off the ground to crazy aerial shots being taken! The more you play the more you will become better. There is dlc addons etc but it hardly has an effect on the gameplay. It's mostly for looks or if your just collecting all of the battle cars/decals. The community (for the most part) is friendly but a few times you could run into somebody who has a bit of a ""character"" but thats any online game.

2016-12-26,1,1,176,False,Recommended,DISCLAIMER This game is amazing +recommend for the unique concept of car soccer and endless customization options. However what's not so great is players like me. I'm the one your friends foretold of when you were considering getting this game the one who you will either carry to victory or tell them they're **** when you inevitably lose the match. I will try my hardest to pass the ball to you or make a shot on the goal but unless I'm extremely lucky it will always up in the hands of the opposing team or in our own goal. There will also be times when you're about to make a shot on the goal and I'll try to prevent the other team from knocking it out of the way and end up doing that myself. Sometimes I'll even attempt an aerial hit but will miss the ball by mere centimeters and be left scrambling for boost while the other team sets up a shot. Don't even think about passing the ball to me either my extreme case of hesitation will result in the ball either flying past me or going straight to the other team. If we ever cross paths I apologize in advance that you couldn't get a better teammate. 10/10 I'm a disgrace _,Rocket League®

Rocket League is for you. Online competitive play makes it even more fun as you scale through the ranks and try to climb the ladder with your friends who also play Rocket League. I've added quite a few friends to my friends list just from playing this game... It's addictive it's fun and I also like how you can do 4 player local split screen and then go online and play against 4 other players for an ultimate match of 4vs4... This game is flexible for multiplayer on so many levels and with the ability to customize your game and change variables it never gets old. BUY Rocket League you'll never regret it!,Rocket League®

2015-08-13,0,0,167,False,Recommended,At the time of this review I currently own 742 games in my library. About 95% are games I got for dirt cheap from a Steam sale (or other) or part of a Humble Bundle (or other). If there was a recent release I would get it discounted from GMG. However If there were ONE game I would pay FULL price for this would be it!Ever since it's release I noticed it was consistently #1 at the Top Sellers in the Store. Decided to research it and watch some videos. Was immediately intrigued by the concept of cars playing soccer. Based on all the postive feedback and reviews I immediately purchased it and zero regrets after. It's ridiculously FUN and can easily be played it short bursts due to the 5 minute matches. It's easy to learn but hard to master the physics and whatnot of the advanced aerial shots but so satisfying when you pull off a crazy goal or save.I highly recommend to anyone that enjoys fun multiplayer games. The polish and quality reminds me of a AAA Nintendo game. The ability to play against PS4 players is pretty cool too. I won't hold my breath at being able to create Parties with friends on PS4 but it's definitely better than being separate. You can play with your friends in a party of 4 or if they're cheapskates you can play locally with 4 player splitscreen as well. Aside from server issues from launch and lack of cross platform party creation this game is very well done and worth every penny. That is all.,Rocket League®

I logged 400 of the hours on a potato laptop so if you are worried about not running it you shouldn't be. I myself have played mostly private matches with a friend on PS4 (a nice addition although you can't have a cross platform party online) and Hoops. If you are on a horrible computer I do not recommend playing in standard or competitive since there are beefy maps such as Neo Tokyo Aquadome and Wasteland. I played Hoops most of the time which helped with aerials and it did not lag. Although I enjoyed playing Hoops and now have a new PC to play the other game modes I wish more people played Hoops and Hockey since they are sort of overlooked. Nonetheless this game is an absolute blast to play and I have no doubt I can get up to 1 000 hours of gameplay now that I can play the other gamemodes easily.,Rocket League®

2016-12-28,0,0,1286,False,Recommended,Rocket League One of the best online multiplayer games of 2015 and one that took many by surprise including myself.

The game has many strong points not limited to but including Very high skill ceillingFun and addictive gameplayGreat matchmaking and overall good netcodeMany customisation optionsMultiple periodic updates of contentPersonally my favourite part of Rocket League is the way it feels once you finally manage to score that awesome aerial goal you've been working at for the past 2 weeks. It feels very satisfying to observe your progress and to become more and more successful. It's also very cool reproducing maneuvers you see from other great players moves you wouldn't even think were possible. Great game.

The game looks silly on the outside but once you start playing it something unexpected happens. It surprises you with being a lot of fun. It's a bloody rocket on a car afterall! Admittedly it's far more fun with friends.The game is simple enough for your casual player to pick up and play and still have fun. At the same time it has a high skill cap... and everything about the game is skill based. None of the unlocks in the game affect how you play.

Also this game proves the practice makes perfect any amount of time put into this game will show improvements. The competitive scene is also very alive and will always find games. on top of the game casual scene for those who arent as competitve and like the fun nature of the game will find alot to do with mutators and other game modes psyonix has released.

2015-09-14,0,0,63,False,Recommended,This game takes fifa and turns it upside down into a sport game that can be enjoyed by gamers that can't even stand football. Why? the game is simple. Cars and a football. There are no progression advantages that will make the game easier to play. Therefore the game requires skill and teamwork instead to win instead of micro transactions. Micro transaction are starting to be become the norm with the likes of heroes and generals and war thunder. Game companies could learn a lot from looking at this correct method of implementing micro purchases.

2017-10-11,0,0,114,False,Recommended,The basic premise sounds pretty terrible. I mean soccer with rocket cars? Dumb. If I had realized what the game was before I bought it (as part of a package with a Steam Controller) I would not have bought it. However having played it I have no regrets. This game is fabulous. The gameplay was beautifully tuned to perfection. Get the game.However it's not perfect. The servers tend to be down or slow more often than other games. And slow servers are a major issue in this game just slightly discernable latency will turn pro players into bumbling idiots.On a side note I strongly recommend a gamepad but the Steam Controller is a poor fit for this game. The controller just feels too clunky in my hands and I perform noticeably worse when playing on it than when using a PS4 controller. Get a PS4 controller and just plug it into your PC with a USB cable it's plug and play and the game recognizes it immediately as a PS4 controller.,Rocket League®

2015-11-18,0,0,1024,False,Recommended,This game pretty much gives me the competitive work on skills everyday feeling I need from a first person shooter or sports game. The game has many mechanics to keep it interesting. Highly competitive yet can have a lot of fun with friends at the same. I hate reviewing but this game is actually tight enough to do so. Rate this game 7 out of 10 which is probably 10 out of 10 for most peoples scale. My few suggestions would be to not only allow you to change the colors of your car for each team but also allow for different attena and toppers. Hard finding color schemes that go both ways. Also the hidden 1.5 second jump mechanic should at least be hinted at in the tutorials. I've been playing for 3 days but find the game easy to pickup if you've ever played fifa or have knowledge of ball physics.,Rocket League®

2015-10-18,1,1,323,False,Recommended,"This is a Superb Game! Being that I never had an interest in cars or soccer/Futball when I first heard about it (on youtube) I skipped over it ""Soccer with cars?"" I thought ""LAME!"" But over the next couple of weeks I kept getting messages from my friends ""Dude you gotta try this game!"" ""Shaggy this game is re DONK ulous buy it and play with me!"" ""Hey have you tried Rocket League it's f**king addicting man!"" and a sleugh of other things all revolving around Rocket League so I caved if my friends were playing it then I'd give it a shot even if I didn't like it at least I'd have another game to play with my friends and it wouldn't be the first time I'd bought a game I didn't like so I could play with my farther out friends. And then I played it. And Played it. And Played it. And Played it. And Played it. And Played it. And Played it. And Played it. If I wasn't working or at school chances were I was playing Rocket League.It was a simple game with simple rules and (if you weren't stuck using a keyboard until you were level 20 like I was) simple controls but there was a finesse a grace that you only got by earning it you could be instantly inherently perfect like some games yes there were other games with similar mechanics and similar controls but this game wasn't about Racing or really even about fighting this was about soccer in ROCKET CARS if you spent the whole game blowing people up you'd never win so there was more to it that going fast and hitting hard you had to PLAY THE GAME.Is it the best game? Maybe Maybe not. But this game has something that not a lot of other games have. And that is Evolution. Because Rocket Leagues Base is so simply yet eloquent it can be looked at and understood by just about everyone and it has the ability that someone whose never played before can pick up the controller play for a bit and think ""You know what would make this game AWESOME?"" And say just about anything and it could make a solid game mode!Just to name a few I've seen that would make fantastic secondary game modes just in case you don't feel like normal Rocket Car Soccer Zero G Obstacles Power Ups Mutators Boost Only Just to name a few.

2017-07-07,0,0,265,False,Recommended,Rocket Leauge is a racing game mixed with soccer. Instead of playing soccer with humans this game is all about playing soccer while controlling a boosting jumping car. Thanks to the boosting and jumping mechanic you can get into the air and make wonderful aerial goals.At first my brother bought the game because he really is into sports games. He always begged for me to join and play splitscreen but I wasn't into sportsgames at all. I knew that Rocket League wasn't an ordinairy sports game but that didn't make me want to play it. Someday I joined my brother on Rocket League and after the first game I was already addicted to the game. I have to say Rocket League brought me into the sports games genre.Conclusion I really recommend the game especially to play with friends. The competitive side really finishes the game and makes you want to play more.JaronTu,Rocket League®

2017-03-22,0,0,1008,False,Recommended,"I love this game however ranked matches have ruined it for me to be honest I'm not a bad player last season just finished i finished on All Star but getting there and staying there was a struggle not so much because of the competition but because similar or higher class players on my team have either just not been trying or trolling barely being able to hit a ball and just not playing to their ability so I've been continuously promoted and demoted no matter how well you play as an individual you will still go down in rank.I have to admit I do have bad games everyone does but this has driven me to uninstall the game several times and vow never to play it again only to pick it up again days later for this I applaude you Psyonix you have mad a simple and truly remarkable game that is simple to play and very difficult to master.These ranked matches though just do my head in sometimes yeah sometimes you get great team mates sometimes it's different playing styles that doesn't click but it's the ones that don't bother when it matters that riles me for example just now I'm playing the 10 matches to rank in this new league 2 Grand Champions are playing on opposite teams even the team mate i'm playing with says yeah our Grand Master isn't even trying even the guy on the opposing team even said ""out of all the matches only one Grand Master has even tried to compete properly so far from what he's seen in this match with two our Grand Master was just watching and laughing at us while he didn't even try no blocking purposefully missing and then mocking us this I absolutely hate this bulls**t youtube twitch &amp game fame is full of cu**s.My advice don't bother with competitive i was much happier before i tried it.",Rocket League®

2016-07-19,0,0,2670,False,Recommended,Rocket League is one of those games that's based around a concept so bizarre that it works. And it works let me tell you. I originally bought the game to mess around with friends on but after the first 50 hours I knew that it had so much more to offer than that. It's skill cieling is so astonishingly high that not even the best in the world have reached it yet. My favorite thing about this game is that new ways to play are constantly being discovered. Unlike in a game like Counter Strike where the only new things you're going to find are a certain place to throw a flashbang or a smoke or something there's always something new top discover in Rocket League fast kick offs pinching the ball dribbling bounce dribbling power shots air dragging half flips and the list just keeps going. Get this game if you want your life to be sucked away by a seemingly simple yet endlessly complex masterpiece.,Rocket League®

In my experience I can't play a multiplayer match without having error 59 (Reservation timed out.) appear on the screen. There is a way around this of course which is to ALT+TAB as soon as it says ""joining in 3 2 1..."" and open the game after 5 6 seconds but this is very tedious over time. Not to mention the occasional rubber banding and connective issues. Since it is a great game with a unique gameplay style and smooth controls (for the controller I dont know about keyboard) I will recommend this game.

A level cap would fix this problem for example you have to be above level 10 to play ranked matches. People leaving ranked matches without any penalty hence making the rest of the match unbalanced and difficult to win for the team. I dislike the off ball camera because controlling it seems stiff and difficult.

2016-01-26,0,0,612,False,Recommended,TLDR At almost 200hrs in so far and not even liking cars or even soccer for that matter Rocket League hits the nail right on the head. The game is fun and a joy to get better at. 10/10 would Soc car again! Rocket League is a game I wasn't expecting to like going in. It's a car game but it's with the addition of the Soccer element that makes Rocket League stand out as a must play. First of all don't expect to be good at this game during your first matches in the game is certainly tough to wrap your head around ESPECIALLY if you're like me and have little to no experience with any games of similar genres. That being said once you get over the initial hump of learning the mechanics and the importance of team placement the game is a BLAST to control! You would think an idea as complex as cars with rockets playing soccer would be a nightmare to control but that's just not the case here! Controlling your car feels great and pulling off a flashy goal for all of your teammates to watch in the post goal replay feels even greater! After each match finishes you also have a small chacne of unlocking cosmetic items for your rocket car like hats antennas even decals! These items give no boosts to stats and are simply cosmetic. In addition Rocket League does a phenomenal job at keeping the game accessible enough for more casual players as well as complex enough for more competitive players like myself to keep coming back for more!,Rocket League®

2015-08-01,0,0,158,False,Recommended,A fast paced physics based game where you try to play soccer with a decked out rocket car while navigating a field of 14 year old drivers and grown men pretending to be 14. Games last 5 minutes making it great for both casual and competitive gamers. Being both amazing and addictive I highly recommend it.Edited after extensive amounts of competitive gameplay ranging from All Star to Challenger Elite solo 3s que so solo players can have an idea of what to expect.Prospect rankings Players have little or no knowledge of field spacing. More often than not the entire team will clump on the ball. Players exercise little to no field awareness. Plan on teammates bumping you off the ball or hitting the ball just to hit it rather than letting a teammate with a better angle clear or progress the ball Whiffing. It's a whiff fest. Don't plan on players always making connection with the ball. Rare aerials. Most game play will be on the ground Tip off roles. Players will most likely all rush the ball on tip off Empty goals. Players will rarely play goalie or rotate field position. Most often when there is a goalie it's a dedicated player who is passive more often than not. Many trash goals and long range goals happen as you can shoot from almost anywhere on the field with 3 playing forward. Players only play the ball directly to the goal the majority of the time with minimal usage of the corners/walls. You really don't have to worry about players blocking angles with their car or demolishing other cars idling on the field. You really don't have to worry about too many players at this level anticipating the angles of the ball whether it's leaving a car or a wall. Players are generally uncomfortable playing backwards and change direction awkwardly. Spatial skills. You don't really have to worry about people using the ball cam and exercising solid mental mapping of ball and player positions.Challenger Rankings Hit or miss on player spacing up until Division 4+. Players often clump to the ball and leave gaps in the field. Players exercise *some* field awareness up until Division 4. Teammates will often bump other teammates off the ball or hit the ball just to hit it rather than let the teammate with the better angle take the touch. Players will most likely have an understanding of position/role rotation at this point. Whiffing. Doesn't happen nearly as much once you're in Challenger division and more often than not it results in an opportunity for a goal. Aerials. Expect players to fly. Tip off roles. Players generally know their role at tip off. Forward/side challenges on tip off one plays mid for the second touch one generally plays goal. It's hit or miss on if the goalie goes to the corner to grab the full boost often resulting in trash tip off goals. It's been my experience that the stronger goalies collect the boosts within the goal box. Empty goals. Players still tend to over extend from time to time leaving empty goals. Furthest one back should hover half field and look for cleanups on centers or to play the ball forward when it is pushed towards them. Count on there being a goalie or someone near goal however. You will find that many of the goalies do not challenge tackles the success of a passive goalie isn't consistent. Players are more creative with shooting at this level. Players no longer only play the ball. Plan on being demolished for idling under a ball while it falls to the ground or while playing a passive goalie. Plan on players anticipating the angle of the ball leaving a wall or car. They no longer play directly to the goal especially if the box is loaded. Anticipate high balls off the wall for centers as well as players playing on the walls and flipping it to mid/goal with a well timed jump. Players are comfortable playing both backwards and forwards. Spin someone out? Plan on them seamlessly transitioning to reverse/forward. Demolishing them completely is your best bet. Spatial skills. It's been my experience that good players use the ball cam. Plan on them having a solid mental map of ball position car positions and field position. Speed boosts. Players will now be strategically pathing through boosts. Rarely will they strategically steal the other team's boosts in front of the goal while applying pressure on the goal.Challenger Elite+ Expect anything. From players demolishing idle cars to strategically removing boosts from the field it's gonna happen. Passive goalies are generally a thing of the past here. Expect any lead touches to be challenged. Players understand position roles and are skilled when it comes to spatial skills and anticipation. Whiffing *rarely* happens and most likely results in a shot on goal. Anticipate connection on every challenge. Control. Once at this level players have an initimate understanding of how to use their car. Plan for them to play the most advantageous angle when it comes to near/far post on shooting. Crossing/center can happen from almost anywhere whether it be from a high spot on the wall or from a defending goalie box.While this isn't everything I hope it gives players an idea of what to expect. This is a great game!,Rocket League®

Also incredibly addictive. Every match lasts 5 minutes so it's basically just highlights of a longer match.Rocket League is also easy to learn and get into but really hard to master.If you have friends that you like playing co op games with I strongly recommend this even if you don't care about soccer at all.,Rocket League®

Trading in this game is also very fun if you do smart trades and keep an eye on item values you can make some good profit. There is alot of skill required to master the game and even after playing for months you will still have to master many more skills. The community is pretty toxic here are some examples when you are trading a large number of players will try and scam you.

It really is. Coustomizable cars fast pace action and awsome graphics.Pros 1.) Graphics are beutiful.2.) You can play 1v1 4v4.3.) Coustomizable Cars. (My car has a top hat D)4.) You dont need feets D!Cons 1.) Wonky Camera. Theres no freeroam camera which I'm a little upset about.2.) Theres a chance where you can get match up with some really good people... On the other team.3.) The controls are ify it's perferable on Controllers.Overall Score 9/10 Freeroam Camera Please? Otherwise Good Game.,Rocket League®

2016-07-21,0,0,181,False,Recommended,The game is fun a good part of the 74 hours I played it were enjoyable however matchmaking on ranked mode needs to be fixed or at least tweaked. Sometimes I'll be playing with people that are way below me and end up winning by a landslide (I ended up winning a game 20 1 at one point) or I'll be the one being blown out of the water (I've lost matches by I believe 13 14 goals). This is really the only part I feel like it needs fixing simply equalizing the situation would make for a rather more enjoyable online environment since matchups would be equilibrated therefore more exciting and fun in my opinion.A great game with a fixable issue on ranked matches.,Rocket League®

Minutes turn into hours and next thing you know you're late for class. Rocket League is one of the few games that I'd say has been crafted perfectly only a few minor things wrong. The best part is that the devs are constantly adding new things to the game such as the ice rink or the upcoming basketball court all for free too. There are two downsides to RL though.First there's a map called wasteland. Pretty buggy and kind of disappointed it made it to the competitive (ranked) gamemodes. Secondly licensed vehicles e.g. the batmobile are not customizable. It was only $2 so no biggie but it would have been nice to to at least have been able to add a flag. The pros outweigh the cons.

This game brings cars and football together (minus the poncy haircuts and ridiculous salaries).In multi player mode you can play competitors from all around the world there is nothing more satisfying than humping a team from Argentina while safe in the knowledge that no matter what the outcome of the match is the Falklands will always be ours.In addition to multi player mode you can also upgrade your car. This includes tyres decals and for the more adventurous gear head why not stick a wizards hat on the roof for good measure....I tried putting a wizards hat on the neighbours cat with slightly less success. Needless to say the cat looked rather fetching but still didn't have any interest in football. My mate Steve put a halo on his car and his exhaust fumes were glitter.

Easy to pick up and smash the ball around like a flopping walrus but so so satisying when you pull off an amazing shot into goal or nail the coordinated pass to your team mate who sinks it into the net.The game is a lot of fun and the cars and ball physics allow for some real tests of skill and precision.

The new hockey mode is sweet and I just can't believe how deep into my gaming rotation it's gotten. I've played over 900 games (almost entirely online multiplayer) and it's just a blast! It's become a bigger time burglar than Civ 5 and that says something. I've been dying for a new PC NHL hockey game and oddly enough this has really helped to fill that gap. The skill level really scales up. It's simple enough that a 5 year old could pick it up in a matter of minutes but the skill at the highest levels is pretty spectacular. This is one of the first game where I've ever befriended strangers to play with. Thanks Psyonix!UPDATE I love they way they are growing the community and the esports. Rocket League is one of the best sports games on Steam today. I declare Rocket League to be HappyHappyGameGame's 2015 game of the year (Narrowly defeating GTAV and Fallout 4),Rocket League®

2016-06-23,0,0,258,False,Recommended,So we all know Rocket League is a pretty decent game playing chaos is fun as hell and matches seem balanced at first sight. Then comes the bad side of Rocket League where apparantely the devs thought it's a fair system to put up a really high ranked player and a low ranked player against 2 others that are the same level between those two ranks. Probably the most idiotic logic I've ever seen in my life. The only outcome of that will be that the high ranked player is going to do all the work and carry the out of the other. This is not fair at all. I've seen people do tricks and that I've never seen before everytime this happens. I'm challenger elite and 75% of my matchmakings consist of a Superstar/Champion (highest blue rank and first purple rank) and then a guy who's prospect elite (highest of silver) And these guys are pretty much a magnet for that ball since 90% of the game it's just the high ranked guy hitting the ball constantly.The devs probably won't do anything about it anyways they got their money and we got this.In the end I like playing with friends but not competitive it's broken as hell.If you buy it remember the competitive is not as fun as it looks like. It's better to find 3 other friends and play chaos.,Rocket League®

2015-11-15,0,0,98,False,Recommended,UPDATE Rocket League has since added plenty of additional modes and ranked features that make this game an absolute necessecity for any gamer out there experienced or otherwise.To put the base concept of Rocket League out there it s a simplified version of soccer involving up to 8 total players driving rocket powered RC cars. You pick up boost on the field launch yourself in the air and drive up the side walls it s a casual simplifield take on the soccer experience. However it is absolutely astounding how much the game will grab you and how exhilirating it is to expereince the chaoticness that can happen. How much this basic concept has such strong legs that the game is able to get away with a lack of features compared to other sports games. It hardly needs them. That s not to say the game lacks features at all. For starters you have 1v1 2v2 3v3 and 4v4 standard modes all of which can feel significantly different when it comes to field control and teamplay. There s ranked modes as well but these are far more limited you have 1v1 ranked duo 2v2 and solo 3v3. A game like this is definitely needs ranked 3v3 teams and possibly 4v4 teams but don t worry lads within 2 days of release the game was picked up by ESL. In fact the first EU cup for the game is taking place today including and I you not a team named PlsHaveMercy going against No Mercy. I know who my money is on.Outside of the online play you have an exhibition mode for quick games against bots a season mode drills to hone your skills a replay mode to edit your favorite victories together and your garage to customize your cars. You unlock parts as you play such as new tires cars paint decals boost trails and hats (you didn t think you could get away from hats could you?) that you earn nearly every game from playing. The customization is a nice touch but the majority of time you will be playing this game will mostly be online going to the garage inbetween matches. That isn t to say you will never stop playing online since the game s servers can occasionally be extremely laggy but to be fair there s good reason for this.On Tuesday Rocket League launched for $20 on PC of you have PS+ on PS4 you can play it for free right now add in Twitch and you had a game that went from 0 players to over 120 000 players in just a couple of days completely overwhelming the developers expectations and thus their twitter their forums and of course their servers leading to some significant outages. The game has completely taken over twitch and is now the one of the top sellers on steam. What myself and many others will be wondering is the lasting power of this game. It has significant potential to be a big esports title despite its casual nature. But current lack of support for ranked 3v3 or 4v4 teams is a pretty major disappointment. We will have to see what the developer does down the line their new found popularity is bound to have some development changes outside of the already announced customization DLC.I know the sports genre is a tough sell on PC probably the most difficult but few will be disappointed in the gameplay that Rocket League offers. It s highly addictive gameplay has already been noted by many and ESL s presence will soon spread its way over to PC. Today s tournament is PS4 exclusive but PC support and tournaments will soon be making its way to PC and yes Deadly Gaming will be competing. Calling now we re not gonna be a squad we re gonna be Team Rocket.8/10,Rocket League®

2016-01-11,0,0,87,False,Recommended,Scorecard http //i.imgur.com/4eoXnuC.pngFull review with screenshots http //www.techfreshness.com/game review rocket league Feature Y/N/Rating Aspect Ratios 4 3 21 9 Good Small Issues for Taller/Wider * Triple Monitor Yes * Framerate Cap 120 144+ * FOV Yes 60 110 horiz + Distance/Height/Pitch SLI Yes Performance Great Options Great 2 Conflicts Key Rebinding Yes (1 Slot) Issues Controller Support/Rebinding Yes Yes Local Co op 2 4 Players Local &amp Online Matches Vert or Horiz Split * Needs Basic UE3 Config Tweak See PCGamingWiki.com/wiki/Rocket_LeaguePC Port QualityYou need to whip out a text editor for a quick edit or two but nothing substantial. Uncapping the framerate can cause an issue with vertical camera movement while jumping repeatedly. I don t believe this has been fixed but I never really noticed it during actual play at 120hz. It supports SLI well from what I can tell and performance is mostly solid outside of small dips from time to time usually right after spawning in. Nvidia Adaptive V sync does force properly with the in game setting off as it should and I don t recall seeing a single tear. The game is very scalable for low end systems and only a 3GB install size.Numerous graphical options including toggles for Motion Blur DOF Bloom etc. However if Bloom is enabled the DOF effects are turned on automatically even though the DOF check box remains unchanged and they are on the same level rather than in a parent/child layout. In addition to that their DOF implementation adds noise to the entire image. There are over 100 lines of graphical settings in the main .ini file so I need to do more testing to see if either can be solved by edits there. Many resolutions and aspect ratios will need to be set manually in that .ini.The HUD scales to the corners which will make them out of view on wider than 21 9. The wider the resolution the closer the camera in the menus. At 21 9 the car almost clips out of frame and on triple wide setups a good 30 40% of the car will be out of frame. During gameplay this is not an issue as the vertical space is equal (set by your FOV setting) regardless of how wide the resolution. The HUD has a safe zone setting which consequently makes the HUD smaller but there s no standard scale setting to reduce huge console tailored sizing while sticking to the edges of the display.For both the PC and console releases there are extensive camera configuration options. Sliders for FOV from 60 110 horizontal degrees distance pitch height rotation speed stiffness (the speed of response to both following the car and your inputs via the right analog) and toggles for hold/toggle camera mode and UI indicator inverting and camera shake.Both KB/M and Controller can be rebound though both only have a single bind per action and some questionable choices make KB/M unusable for high level play. Mouse movement can be mapped to the camera but it acts like the analog stick requiring continuous input in one direction otherwise it jitters around or snaps back to center and not in a usable way like Saint s Row 3/4 s implementation. It s inexcusably bad especially considering much older games Rocket League is trying to emulate did far better.I was extremely happy to see local 4 player split screen play online and off with horizontal and vertical splitting and per player camera FOV/position settings. The only real issue is that the game won t let you specify a player s input as the KB/M. You either need a controller for each player or need to use a workaround to trick the game into thinking you have a controller filling the first slot so that the real controllers fill 2 4.GameplayThe core gameplay is an absolute blast. Even if you don t like soccer or racing/cars you ll likely still have fun. Traditional sports games offer relatively vague control over a player or entire team and Rocket League plays more like a racing sim or first person shooter in the sense that every single movement is deliberate as it would be for a participant in a real sport. The rule set is no more complex than to get the ball/puck/cube in the goal 1 4 players on either side most goals in the time limit wins. Such simplicity means players only need to concern themselves with the movement system reading the situation and working with your team. Sometimes you want a competitive experience without memorizing every inch of a complex map or the pros and cons of every weapon choice and Rocket League is exactly that.In addition to the online modes (1v1 4v4 Ranked and Unranked + 1 Mutator/Hockey Lobby) you have 3 other that you can play purely alone and offline. Exhibition is essentially free play with control over all sorts of modifiers player counts AI difficulty etc. You can play with up to 4 players locally or online and can play unbalanced match ups (1v3 2v4 etc) using the unfair difficulty. Season is a single player only tournament mode with control over difficulty length team size and team number. On the cosmetic side you can choose a team logo (which effects the paint color and coloring for your half of the field) name and the vehicles your teammates use. Adding the ability to add local/online teammates would notably improve the lifespan of this mode. Finally Training offers a generic free play a basic movement and controls tutorial and 3 advanced trials (with 3 difficulty settings each) for goal keeping striking and aerials. The top levels are extremely challenging but it s great that this mode is here as it presents the opportunity to constantly practice advanced moves where real matches rarely do.PresentationAside from the noise with DOF enabled the rendered image is very appealing. Fantastic use and variety of color in the effects and fields. I found it slightly lacking contrast and saturation for my tastes but that's nothing Reshade can't fix up.The soundtrack is only present in the menu and is a nice selection of up beat electronic and trance music. The dynamic crowd reactions and general sound effects are very well done and can be adjusted in the options.ConclusionIt s such a simple idea executed to a surprisingly high level of quality. Every time I started playing I ended up putting in another 4 5 hours. Even solo with random players online the game is tremendously engaging and a joy to play. If the content stopped coming entirely I could see myself getting bored after a while. If however they keep on their current path some new items here a new map/mode there I could easily see myself playing off and on throughout all of next year if not longer. In terms of raw content I don t think the game has reached its most compelling price point. But with more content being added and its price gradually coming down it ll happen soon and I d urge you to give it a shot. I d have been quicker to put money down if a demo was available because of how great it runs and feels so It would probably benefit them to implement one. Till then there s always the Steam refund system in case you don t like how it feels or if it conflicts with your system. You can definitely get the gist in an hour or two but if you like it you ll be begging for more.,Rocket League®

Playing alone is a good time consumer but playing together with friends is much more fun. I often play it when I have to wait for about 15 minutes for a friend to come back from dinner so we can play a round of dota or smth like that.In the current state of the game I would call the matchmaking system broken. It wasn't until recently that I got queued against players with much higher ranks then I have. Following that I got annihilated by them which let me put the game aside for a while. And no one really wanted the new microtransactions either but hey you don't have to buy them if you don't want to.In the end it's a pretty fun game to play. If you are experiencing high ping don't even try to play it. The game behaves really strange (ball glitches around player moves left and right completely random etc.) like nothing I have seen so far.

2016-02-07,0,0,265,False,Recommended,This game overall is excellent. The simple to learn hard to master mechanics lend it a very realistic feel and the main con I have so far is in the occasional (reasonably rare but getting more common as time goes on) bad matchmaking. The DLC items are purely cosmetic and the game is not pay to win in any way. The DLC items IMO are cool enough to pick up though despite that. My personal favorite is the Takumi from Supersonic fury and also the included carbon fiber paint type. This brings up the subject of customization. It is quite varied even in the base game with no DLC the only lacking area being the paint types. There are plenty of toppers (Top Hat anyone?) and the variety of antennas wheels boosts and actual body types are quite good too. The gameplay itself in writing sounds like it would get repetitive quickly but especially when playing with mutators is always fun and entertaining. This has to be one of the most addicting games I have ever played if not the most. The gamepad controls are excellent and logical and are remappable. The keyboard controls are reasonably intuitive but I personnally vastly prefer the remote for the analogue sticks and triggers. The physics are quite good too they feel very realistic in mass but the cars handling and boost mechanics are very arcadey which gives the game an overall arcade feel. I enjoy this game quite a lot and can see myself playing it for quite a long time.EDIT Why is wasteland in comp? pls no psyonix. Also I have no idea what people are talking about when they say you need a superboss titan Z i7 5960X origin PC for this to run at max. I use an ancient i7 (averaging around 20 40% usage) and a gtx 960 4 gb (average 50% usage 1680x1050) so running it at decent settings shouldnt be hard.Overall 9/10,Rocket League®

With many people to play with for multiplayer whether it's a pal or family next to you Steam friends and even those playing on the PS4 thanks to crossplay there is no shortage of people to play with. Unfortunatly server issues still exists but when it's fully fixed the multiplayer will be amazing.

Worth the money no doubt would pay higher if i had too. If you like basically any sports (Soccer Basketball Hockey Etc.) this is the game for you.

2017-07-27,0,0,1029,False,Recommended,Rocket League is one of those games you just happen to watch your friend playing and think it's cool before you realize the gold mine of fun he/she is sitting on. It's legit fun and the fact that each game is roughly 5 minutes means you won't be putting 3 hour sessions on a single game. However though trust me you will be playing for hours on end. It is that addicting. There is literally no substitute for this game. it is definitely easy to learn but hard to master. And before you start shelling out the big bucks for Titanium White Zombas... I know they look nice but they don't make you better. Watch out for scammers though,Rocket League®

2017-09-09,1,1,1018,False,Recommended,ROCKET LEAGUE IS AWESOME PROS 1. Performance This game is so well done that I'm sure can run in a 2005 computer.2. Challenging You're bound to improve your abilities when you get a high tie in competitive.3. Variability There are a lot of minigames to play as an example Hoops! And it's free.4. World Community You will be always playing with people from all around the world if you're playing in USA servers.5. Updates OMG! Rocket League keeps updating every time and it makes me proud of buying it.6. Prices Rocket League keys aren't expensive. With $4.99 you are able to buy 5 keys.7. Trades Trade system is perfectly design. CONTRA 1. Some People People is usually toxic in competitive. I've seen that if you play with random people you'll be team up with 4 toxic players in 10 matches.2. Servers For latin people as me some servers might lag your experience. Be sure to have a good internet conection before buying it.What are you waiting for? Just buy it!,Rocket League®

2016-04-10,0,0,574,False,Recommended,10/10 Game for 5 minutes of action packed fun.10/10 Game for rage inducing team matesSo here's how not to suck complete at Rocket League1. You have 2 Camera's. Watch the ball AND watch where you goddamn drive. Bumping Team Mates is BAD2. Don't play under a bouncing ball this is BAD. 95% of the time you won't win the exchange circle around to defense and let your team mates charge ahead.3. Don't play dead balls. If it's rolling around slowly and you're next to it... Leave it and go to defense.4. Don't chase the ball all game this is BAD. You're more likely to mess up a set up play for someone who is trying to actually win than be helpful always being on the ball.5. Defense play is GOOD. When your whole team is crashing back to defend you can break out and get the ball back to the other end and score an easy goal.6. Your game sense will come. But if you haven't gotten the idea of how to not be complete garbage from the first 5 points i'll say it again. DEFENSIVE PLAY WINS GAMES.7. Practice Aerials and Wall shots in Freestyle/Training. Like game sense this will come in time.TL DR You shouldn't buy this game you impatient moron.,Rocket League®

2016-02-03,0,0,20,False,Recommended,Rocket League This is a positive review this game is amazing and is definitely worth the price tag of 14.99. It's a car based football game. In Rocket League you get behind a wheel of numerous cars and face off against up to 4 of the opposition using team effort to hit the ball into the back of the net Theres solo play multiplayer and even online matchmaking you can play 1v1 2v2 3v3 and 4v4.Here are some of the pros of the game great graphics and visual effects It has a wide range of customisation options to unlock as you level up. There's a season mode if you want to play solo so you don't always play online with different options to make it very interesting. Theres local multiplayer which supports up to four player (if you have enough controllers) A number of different maps with different weather variations. It's Cross platform so you can play with PS4 players but theres no party system for Cross platform yet. Has quick messages which you can communicate with quickly with your teammates. You can save your amazing goals with the save replay button so you can watch them later. Full controller support so you can just plug in and play PS4 or Xbox. It's even entertaining for those that are not keen on real life sports like me. Theres physics so your cars top speed is different on other maps if the floor is made out of tarmac it's alot quicker compared to a grass pitch. It's no a massive thing but It's definitely a great touch.This is a pro and a con the game's bots aren't great but the game's full experience is by playing multiplayer.This is the only con. the Solo play gets very repetitive and boring overall my rating is a (9.5/10)Overall Rocket League is an incredibly good multiplayer game with awesome visuals loads of customisation options and numerous amounts of different maps with different weather on each one. If you're looking for a new multiplayer game or just something a bit different you've come to the right place.,Rocket League®

The bugs include when the boost counter sometimes dissapears however this does not happen very often. The gameplay is fun and enjoyable without bugs and bad teams.Updates 3/5 Psyconix updates the game alot (maybe too much) and I personally think they are adding new items too fast e.g. Turbo crates and Nitro crates were both added in under 2 months which is too quick in my opinion. Also the updates aren't that bad but they have NOT fixed the servers in Asia and Oceania yet and they have been faulty for a long time and haven't yet fixed bugs e.g. hotbar bug terrible casual matchmaking and more.Matchmaking 2/5 Once upon a time there was a scrub named 'Timmy.' Timmy was addicted to Rocket League after spending 5000 hours on the game in 1 year. Timmy joins a casual match after a long hard day and joins a game where the score is 6 1. Timmy's reaction is ""oh crunch "" then he leaves the game and joins another game. As he enters the game the score is 12 0 and the it is an xp farming game with bots. Timmy then decides to leave the game. Timmy joins another game. Timmy takes a sneaky peek of the score and it is 2 5 to his team. Timmy decides that he wants a fair matchmaking game so he leaves the game. Timmy gets some milk and comes back. He carefully sips up the milk and decides to join ANOTHER GAME. 4th game now and Timmy is getting a bit triggered. He joins a game and it ends as he joins. He then gets angry and screams ""AHHHHHHHH."" Timmy looks for another game. Timmy joins another game. When he joins the game everything is fine and he decides to say ""hello"" in chat. xX_Shrek420_Xx replied "" you get deported "" Timmy replies ""reported "" xX_Shrek420_Xx replies ""that's it I am selling your IP on eBay."" (His IP later was sold for 0.99$ on eBay. Timmy at this point has contracted crippling depression and various other STD's. Timmy tries one more time to join a casual match. His router fried and his house burnt down. The end?Yeah when they fix the matchmaking (and the bugs) it'll be a higher rating )",Rocket League®

2015-07-11,0,0,11,False,Recommended,At the reccomendation of an awesome person with great taste in games I decided I'd give this game a shot. Let me start by saying I hate watching most sports and playing most of them irl or as a game is kind of meh as well. Racing as both a spectator sport and as a gaming genre is total ballsack and I would never waste a dime on that kind of junk.For some reason when you rub these two genres together hard enough you get that magic gaming spark. This is a rewarding adrenaline fueled nitro boosted hellsport that will make you curse your own lack of skill one minute and have you almost on your feet cheering for yourself and your buddies the next.Making a car go fast is boring but learning to make a car jump juke and borderline literally fly at the perfect angles to bounce a ball your friend lobbed to you into a goal? Most exciting thing I've done on the internet in a long time.I reccomend playing with at least one friend and with a controller if possible cause keyboard and mouse are meh for this one.,Rocket League®

2015-07-19,1,1,20,False,Recommended,I've had trouble writing this review mostly because I couldn't think of anything to say besides get this game.But for real buy this game. It's such a fresh breath of air. Let's start off. The community is bustling beyond expectations. I just saw like 200k players online. Obviously it wont stay that way forever but that is a solid community for a non AAA game. Once this game gets on some steam sales players are never gonna have to worry about finding games. For those seeking a competive experince this is also the perfect game. They have ranked playlist but also have normal ones for people like me who just like a chill game.Also this game runs and plays fantastic. I haven't encountered any real technical glitches or framerate drops. That's just really nice. I heard there were some issues with the servers early on but since I bought it I haven't encountered any.Oh and lets also mention that despite being a game that has a ton of cosmetic options there isn't any microtransactions. When it comes to cosmetics that is never really a big deal to me but it is still nice to see. If they ever add them I wouldn't mind though.And finally to the gameplay. This gameplay is non stop fast paced action. I'm not one to play tutorials I didn't need one. I just hopped into a bot game learned the ropes and boom I was ready to play. Even the bot matches are crazy fun.So yah buy this game. I'd say it's well worth the 20 dollars but it's also a perfect sale game. Just make sure you play it in your lifetime mkay?Edit for the badge,Rocket League®

2016-01-06,0,0,32,False,Recommended,I must say this game sounds awful football with cars. However I find it's very good and entertaining with friends. It is difficiult to control the ball with cars even without the other team members and sometimes even your own added into the mix. It turns into a caiotic scramble for the ball when its near the goal of either side generating some halarious moments own goals and just pure chaos. Very funny. Games are also shortish and around 5 minutes so its quick to get into a game. Major plus points are the fact that it is cross platform and so works with other players perfectly with almost no lag (apart from a little lag due to my pc)Overall an excellent game,Rocket League®

2017-07-14,0,0,114,False,Not Recommended,Review as Casual GamerThe Game is fun in the beginning and with friends that are on your level. Playing against others online is fun but the whole ranking system is broken. This game is nothing for casual gamers who just want some fun matches. The reason behind this is the ranking system no matter what you will rank up. With time you will become Pro or Veteran and you will play against people who actually know how to play and fly around.Since I do only play it casually I get killed on the playing field. While the game brands me as a Veteran I am basically only Semi Pro (lower end) but I have to play against other Veterans Masters and Legends some. Eventually your rank will increase (with time) to a point where this game is unplayable for casual Gamers. I wish the game would give negative points for losing (or quitting when you are behind) so that I will not automatically increase my rank with time. Good players will still become legends and Veterans and casual gamers will be in their own League remaining on Rookie or Semi Pro and have fun playing against people are on their level.,Rocket League®

2016-07-20,0,0,46,False,Recommended,It is extremely difficult to describe the joy of crossing someone on a mad drive to the goal. The entire opposing team is throwing all they have at you at every turn there s a revving engine and burning rocket motor trying to get in between you and your fleeting but oh so enjoyable fame. With every juke you shatter the opposing team s hope of victory (as well as your teammate s hopes of ever touching the ball) and end up just yards from the goal (meters in people that haven t been to the moon units.) You let loose with the most savage double jump crossover on the goalie as you can. The ball screeches into the goal and detonates sending all on the pitch careening across the field in a frenzy of jumps and spontaneous boosts celebrating your play.

If you got a very bad temper like my friend and I this game might not be for you. Ragequits and destroyed friendships are some of the casualties you have to give for this game.

And if thats not good enough for you there are 37 different cars to choose from and millions of items to customize them with. Also if your one of those people who like to waste there money on crates trying to get the best items Rocket league has that for you. I strongly reccomend this game to everyone.,Rocket League®

2016-02-22,1,1,176,False,Recommended,This is a fantastic game. I have 130+ hours and it's still just as fun as the first time I played it. The developers Psyonix add free new features constantly (new maps new game modes new toppers/flags) and cosmetic paid DLC such as the Batmobile. Plus Cross play ensures a huge playerbase at all hours of the day.However Psyonix seems to only consider the eSports scene and the high level players. They added three new non standard maps which is great but one is heavily focused on aerials (Underpass) and another is heavily focused on walls (Utopia Retro). Both of these are incredibly hard for new players to learn. Now it's fine to have these new maps as they are in their own game mode (Rocket Labs). However they did announce that they will consider putting these maps in the Competitive rotation. I've played games on these maps (Prospect III/Elite level not very high but not lowest of the low) where it was 0 0 the entire five minute game and 2 3 minutes of overtime.This game is awesome. But it's not friendly to newcomers.,Rocket League®

2016-07-25,0,0,1911,False,Recommended,"The best ""foot""ball game of all time. Huge learning curve tons of actual skills to obtain and master. Adrenaline boosted gameplay in the tightest of matches and crazy stuff happening on the gamefield. Probably the most efficient euros &gt fun ratio on steam especially when on sale. Most people use controllers and I also recommend using the xbox 360/one/elite or ps3/ps4 controller (the one you are used to or more comfortable with) to play this game. After trying out Xbox elite and Razer Wildcar (xbox) I must say the Wildcat is the best controller so far to play this game. Steamcontroller would be a bit cheaper solution with extra buttons in the back aswell. Wildcat takes it over Elite for me just because of the technology (microswitches) behind the actual buttons.",Rocket League®

2016-01-04,0,0,92,False,Recommended,Rocket League is a solid easy to learn but hard to master game that takes the basic concept of soccer and puts it into one of those wacky physics based game worlds where monster trucks can fly and flip at the click of a button.

2017-07-31,0,0,17,False,Recommended,Before I get into the details of this review I first off want to say that if your not a big soccer fan don't be scared to try out Rocket League. The mechanics may be similar to soccer but in no way feel the same once you start playing. keep in mind that this my personal opinion and may not apply to other people Either way let's get down to bizz. (I say that like bizz is still something people say xD)The pros are.The ball may be sensitive but isn't that how it would work?A neat variety of modes.Customization that you unlock from playing.Good variety of vehicles.Maps that are the same as their normal variants but have different weather.Cons.The ball has a tendency to get stuck in the corners until everyone stops hitting it and let's it drop to the ground and then hits it or someone hits it in midair.Can't do full donuts (What I would like to see.More maps.maybe a mode where you have mounted guns to shoot the ball and players with.Make custom teams in season mode.4 team ffa.A rumble ability that places a wall would be interesting. (maybe not xD)Zombie mode.Music while playing (not just in the title screen)And that's all I can think to put here for now.,Rocket League®

2015-12-06,1,1,114,False,Recommended,Very fun and good game. Haven t played it that much yet (7 hours) but so far its pretty good. I like the cars and all the custom things you can do. It feels like a game where you have to be skilled to play it you will not just learn it in 1 hour. Some of the servers have pretty bad connection and i find myself lagging a bit sometimes but not game breaking. I really wish i could play with my friends online who are playing it on PlayStationI usually play it when i get tired of playing CS GO or something else. Then this is a great game to play and doesn t require as much focus.,Rocket League®

2016-09-22,0,0,355,False,Recommended,Rocket League is by far the best competitve multiplayer game I have ever played. One of the many great things about this game is how accessible it is to new players despite having a very high skill gap. Not only is it very easy to get into and very addicting but it is incredibly hard to master. The dilemna between the game being accessible and the game having a high skill ceiling has been handled perfectly. Additionally there are both casual and ranked playlists as well as private matches. No matter how casual or hardcore you are as a gamer there is almost certainly a place for you in this game.The game is also incredibly rewarding especially during those moments where you make those goals you never thought you would. In gaming one can only derive satisfaction from achievement if the achievement was difficult to attain. Not too difficult but not so easy that the sense of accomplishment fades after a few hours. This is another thing that Rocket League has nailed. Dribble goals double taps off the wall aerials and freestyle goals (to name a few) are all incredibly satisfying to make. The controls are tight and responsive and mechanically the game is near flawless. The physics are also very accurate for the most part. Hitting the ball feels satisfying due to both visual and audible feedback. The sound and graphics are both well done and serve their purpose well. There is car custimization as well as player trading and cases. I tend to ignore these things because I'm not big on cosmetics. The game plays faster than most and can even be chaotic at times. This is something that I enjoy although I could understand others not appreciating it as much. It is very engaging and hands on. Matches are only 5 minutes making it easy to quickly jump into for a game or two. Another thing I believe is commendable is the commitment the developers have shown to continually updating their game. They have introduced several new and fun gamemodes since launch including Rumble Hoops and Mutator Mash Up. All of the new maps and modes are free. It seems that Psyonix is more interested in the overall longetivity and quality of the game than making as much money as possible. The same cannot be said for many triple A games these days.That's not to say that everything is perfect. There is no shortage of player toxicity in this game and unfortunately until recently the report system pretty much did not work at all. I am glad to hear that this is slowly changing though. Also the game's matchmaking can feel somewhat frustrating at times. There are micro transactions although they are much less prevalent than in many other games. They are there though so If you hate that kind of thing keep that in mind.Overall I cannot overstate how great this game is. I feel confident in saying that if you enjoy completitive multiplayer games at all you will enjoy this game.I would give numerical rating but I don't feel that a number can fully capture how high my opinion of this game is.,Rocket League®

It has lots of different game types to keep you and your pals coming back for more and asking for that one rematch everytime.And of course the season mode is great too Working together with bots to climb your way to the top of the standings isn't just fun but useful for learning the ins and outs of the game.Overall this game is such good fun and I would reccommend this game to practically everyone who likes competitive or just plain old funny gameplay.

2015-07-10,0,0,1084,False,Recommended,One of the most fun and addictive games I have ever played. Absolutely a must to play with friends (or even pubs). Single player is fine for learning the mechanics but multiplayer is where this game shines.Others will explain the details of the game far better than myself but basically this is a game of soccer (1v1 2v2 3v3 or 4v4) where people are replaced by cars. While the cars can appear different (a lot of cosmetic customizations) they handle identically. You collect boost from highlighted areas on the field that automatically regenerate after a few moments. You can use the boost to give yourself a burst of speed to try and catch up to the play drive the ball with some extra force or even blast your car way into the air (some people are amazing at that). You can also jump/hop/flip your car a bit which can benefit you by giving you a little extra oomph.Once you ge the hang of the basics the game will start to really come to you. After your first MP goal you will likely be addicted. The matches are only 5 minutes long which actually seems like the sweet spot for keeping the games tight and white knuckled.If you are looking for a fun relatively inexpensive multiplayer game to play with friends this will likely scratch that itch for quite a while. Simply put the game is outstanding fun. Also due to it being a cross platform game the amount of players is FAR greater than what Steam will show you. That number just represents the PC crowd. For example Steam was showing around 5600 players during my last game but there was over 70 000 people playing the game. This should certainly help keep the multiplayer servers active for quite some time.,Rocket League®

2015-07-24,0,0,183,False,Recommended,This game is pure genius. The simplicity of this game makes it so much fun. Everything about this game is enjoyable. The team play and the setups you can make with friends/teammates are unreal. When you score a goal it feels so satisfying as loud goal horn goes off and the ball explodes blowing everyone back. Making UNREAL saves flying through the air and saving the game for your team feels phenomenal.This game is absolutely worth every cent it's asking for. When I saw this game was only 20 dollars and free on PSN this month I was astonished. This could easily be charged as a $60 AAA title. Why even play Fifa anymore when you have this. Pick this game up seriously. The devs even say that they plan to make free DLC in the future which is a big plus in many players books.10/10,Rocket League®

2015-07-12,0,0,1,False,Recommended,I first downloaded Rocket League on the PS4 because it was free for PS+ members. Since playing on the PS4 and enjoying it so much I felt so bad that I got the game for free that I had to come over and pay full price on Steam for it. Yeah I know the devs get some cheese from Sony for the PS+ promos but still. Rocket League is a beautiful fast and fun pick up and play arcade style sports game. The controls are simple enough that you'll feel like a badass playmaker your first game or so. Oh and the addition of local co op and cross platform play is really nice to see too.,Rocket League®

2015-09-14,0,0,76,False,Recommended,"Rocket League is two different things to different people either it's a fun game you play with your friends to have a good time or it's a uber competitive game demanding intense skill to rise to the top of the rankings. Know that I write this review as a gamer looking to have a good time.This game is beautiful in its simplicity. It's easy to learn difficult to master and it has a way of making a good deal of your shots feel epic as hell. Playing with friends hasn't brought forth behavior I'm used to from games ""built for eSports "" maybe my friends are more laid back than most people are but mistakes are nothing more than mistakes and good plays pump everyone up regardless of who made the play. This game is really fun if you want it to be if you're in this game for the ranking you're subjecting yourself to the negativity every single eSport gamer complains about. If you just want to have fun you will love this game.",Rocket League®
2016-06-04,0,0,851,False,Recommended,its gud,Rocket League®
2016-09-11,0,0,142,False,Recommended,It goes without saying that I love this game so far I've spend over 135 hours playing it.The review in short Pros It's fun racing and trying to score It has active developers New updates (like cars maps and gamemodes) released every now and then Not paid to win.Cons None.Long review When this game was first released I purchased it before the hypetrain took Rocket League to the next level. Back then it only had the standard gamemode and a number of cars. The developers quickly released some patches for bugs that needed fixing but it was a very well made game upon release.The DLCs released by Psyonix are definitely worth their money if you're interested in new car models wheels boost designs etc. No DLC is paid to win and microtransactions have only been introduced recently crates and keys containing more visual items there are no paid to win items at all so that's a big plus.As for the gamemodes it started with a pretty simple arena and you just had to score. Soon after they released the hockey gamemode where the ball was turned into a puck which actually behaved like one. After that they released the hoops gamemode which is similar to basketball. You have hoops which are elevated and you score by making the ball go through the hoop from above (it doesn't work from below I've tried). Just recently they released the rumble gamemode in this gamemode you play in a random arena (from the default gamemode) and you get random powerups every 10 seconds. To get a new powerup you have to use your current one and wait for 10 seconds. Powerups can include teleportation (you vs. an opposing player) force boost on an opposing player a magnet which attracts the ball towards you from a certain short distance and a lot more. It's quite fun and refreshing.Other than the abovelisted gamemodes you have regular and ranked gameplay. Both try to match you with players of your skill level as best as they can and they quite often do a good job of doing so.This game is definitely recommended because at first I did not think I would be playing this game as much as I do.,Rocket League®

2017-06-28,0,0,379,False,Recommended,Rocket League is a great game for three reasons. Firstly it has stunning graphics and physics. Secondly it is something you can always come back to and play with friends. Thirdly the skill ceiling is sky high you can excel in many ways.Psyonix have also made great efforts at implementing tutorials training modes several fun game modes as well as a competitive ladder system and stunning cosmetics with endless possible combinations.Rocket League is a game where you'll start off laughing at your frustration and struggle to play properly but you'll eventually grow tired of the chaotic fun and instead strive to find clarity in the chaos.8/10.,Rocket League®

I cant wait to see if psyonix will keep putting out content for this game. things like more car bodies maps and general customization maybe even new game types. that being said there have been some connectivity issues. The game has its good and bad sessions. sometimes is lag free other times its lackluster at best. I expect they will improve the issue with an update soon.,Rocket League®

I would honestly reccomend this game to anyone. Unless you REALLY hate soccer and you simultaneously REALLY hate cars.(If you found this review helpful consider giving it a thumbs up!)",Rocket League®
2016-01-04,2,1,402,False,Recommended,Rocket league is a game that combines both football(soccer) and driving cars.The game is suitable for both casual and competitive players.But is the game simple and is it easy to be mastered? Somehow I do not think so.It takes hours and hours of practice and when u have 100 hours u realized that you can finally shoot the goal.(On the ground) To start with the game has a really good performanced ranking system which as I said is good for the competitive players. However sometimes you can have a match vs way higher level opponent which is sometimes annoying but it is still fun.I'd say it's better to practice a lot and then jump into the competitive scene of the game because sometimes when you play 2v2/3v3s and you make a lot of mistakes your partner(mostly) will flame you which isn't really nice.But if you do not care ofcourse you can play instantly ranked. In audition I have to say that the community of the game is mostly positive and friendly.But you know there are always s that will be toxic. There are many types of modes that can make the game even more attractive! I would like to say something for each.So there's 1v1 mode which is mostly based on luck but ofcourse you must have skills to have this luck.If you are not a teamplayer and you want to climb the ladder alone this mode is perfect for you! Ok so there's 2v2 too. Here's required to have more teamplay spirit and you need to know where your partner is in each situation so you can pass him and luckily score a goal.That makes 2v2s a teamplay mode. 3v3s are even more teambased mode.Just like 2v2s you need to pass a lot have a strategy and score a goal but ofcourse you can always join alone and be with 2 randoms.(NOT RECOMENDED) In conclusion I'd say that this game is really fun in any aspects.It's definitly worth it to buy.There are not dlcs that add extra power speed etc. which is great.Everything is based on skills and rarily luck.If you found this review helpful thumbs up. ),Rocket League®

2015-08-23,0,0,108,False,Recommended,Rocket League the sequel to Superpowered Acrobatic Rocket Powered Battle Cars is a game that fuses soccer and driving to create one of the most addictive games I've ever played. Right off the bat I can't praise the developer enough. Psyonix is perhaps the greatest developer I've come across in terms of listening to community feedback keeping them up to date with regular posted updates and patch notes and constantly reinventing the game to keep it fresh. Major bugs are always fixed within the day minor bugs don't take much longer to fix. They are always releasing new game modes customisation options and other features that make the game easier to play. Psyonix is a reliable and trustworthy developer that isn't going to abandon the game or just use it for money grabbing.The community itself is rather hit and miss. Generally half the people in your game will be friendly and show good sportmanship the other half will be the salty kind that flame you blame every goal conceded on you and challenge you to 1v1s if you happen to beat them. It's internet gaming this aspect is an inevitable one. Although being a little too trade oriented (just look at the comments of any popular Rocket League guide for evidence) the community is overall one of the friendlier that I've come across most games end up being pleasant experiences.Matchmaking is rather flawed at this point in time however Psyonix recently posted updates on the Rocket League website and on social media addressing the issues involved with matchmaking and laying out their plans to fix these problems. Skill range has increased quite significantly in ranked play following the start of Season 4 and the introduction of a new ranked system while the amount of time it takes to find an online match has at times significantly increased also. It does seem as though these issues are to be short lived and this review will be updated accordingly but at the time of writing it's probably the game's biggest flaw.The game's controls are simple comfortable and responsive. It is vitally important that you play with a controller not keyboard and mouse due to the precision needed on the part of the player during aerials and other maneuvers a keyboard setup just does not offer the same accuracy or comfort as a controller does. The button mapping is very easy to remember but is easy to edit as well should you find the need.Customisation options are initially limited and due to the presence of an in game 'economy ' some options are limited to those players that can invest money into obtaining them. Regardless the default options obtainable simply by playing games to completion are still plentiful and flexible with thousands of different combinations available here alone. The player can change the colour of their car and the decals they apply to it as well as choosing from a huge range of car body shapes wheels and 'toppers.' It does not take long for the player to be able to create a car that looks incredible.The price is more than justifiable. Assuming you spend nothing on keys and other items then you're spending 15 maximum on easily 100 hours of consistently high quality gameplay.In short I'd recommend this game to anyone. I'm not a huge fan of soccer but I'm beyond addicted to this game. The futuristic yet realistic approach works absolute wonders.,Rocket League®

It's football with (ROCKET) cars I mean. Does it get cooler than that? A very large learning curve don't be mistaken by thinking this is a simple game. It's logic is simple but performing takes A WHOLE LOT of practicing. Now you decide whether that is a good or a bad thing IMO it is definitely a great thing. You can and you should play it with friends it is like so much fun to do it especially if you both suck in the beginning (which is totally understandable). If you are not the type of guy who likes to play with friends (2x2 3x3 4x4) or for that matter in a team you can always play 1x1 matches. So yeah you've got that covered. It has a LOT of customization including low priced (4euroish) DLCs so you can create your very own distinguished vehicle.Why are you still reading this?

2015-10-19,1,1,255,False,Recommended,Rocket league is a magnificent game.It can be a game just for fun to play or you can play it competitively.The DLC's are 100% not needed to play the game and are simply to improve asthetics of your car.It is definitely an original game that involves Insane goals Amazing asthetics Very little glitches And ALOT. Of salt.The progress of ranking up usually takes a while as you tend to gain 1000+ xp every match. The ranking system is actually quite good as to be the Veteran rank it takes a lot of time to get from level 20 to 30. It fits since Veterans are people that have put a lot of time into the game.It is a game that gets me insanely into it because I love getting goals and especially when you score an aerial goal. Such a sense of accomplishment.As of now I own all DLC and have unlocked all of the achievements. I have put 100 hours into the game and every single one has been worth it. If you're thinking of getting the DLC and put a lot of time into the game I recommend purchasing it if you care about what your car looks like. I plan on purchasing all DLC released (except from the soundtrack) as i love the game.I don't remember the price off the top of my head but i believe it was 15 and that 15 was MUCH worth it. This game is a must have for any 'football/soccer' lovers. In my personal opinion it is 100% better than any other football/soccer games such as FIFA and PES because you can fly. FLY!

2015-11-17,1,1,187,False,Recommended,So a friend of me asked me to do a 1 word review for Rocket League... Which words could you use while describing/reviewing Rocket League... Fun? Great? Nah that wouldn't do justice to the game. Awesome? Not correct its better then awesome. I would describe the game as EPIC! Might be a cheesy word to use but it really does justice to the game. It is even fun for people who don't like soccer. It is fun to play alone but is even more fun if you play it with friends. Sometimes you all will be rolling on the floor laughing of things that happend during the game.There is a great selection of free cars where you can choose from with special livery's for each of these cars. They really created a good solid base of the game with great range of cars/hats/rims and other things you can add on your car. Ofcourse like any other game you can buy DLC's. These DLC's will give you extra cars and some other things for a reasonable price. Great thing is you don't need to buy any of the DLC's to be better or to gain an advantage. In no way this game is pay to win. You don't even have to like soccer/football or cars to like this game. It is fun for everyone!,Rocket League®

2015-12-24,3,1,232,False,Recommended,The game is quite easy to play and joyful which is important. You probably won't be insulted if you lose (unless you're an emotionally weak person) because matches here are only 5 minutes long. They're simply too short to get you to the point of humiliation. Moreover players are equal skill decides here.I haven't noticed any cons yet.So let's typically count pros and cons PROS fun and easy to play (hard to master though) balance short matches so that you won't feel that your time was wasted CONS noneAll in all it's a great example of balance fun and original concept combined in one piece.

2016-10-11,0,0,178,False,Recommended,"One of the most fun games I've accientally bumped into a few years Rocket League is one of the few games I'll always have installed everywhere and easily slipped into my 'favorite games of all times'.Rocket League is also one of the few games that you really have to try in order to see how much fun it is (especially when using a controller) so I recommend you to watch some videos and if you feel interested by the gameplay definitely use the refund time to try it out. Videos can't really make justice.With the addition of the ""Rumble"" gameplay mode it made the game 10x more fun chaotic and dynamic. A must have for anyone looking into Co op experiences. There are a decent amount of updates that come out on a reasonable amount of time that may add new game modes arenas cars or items to customize your appearance. Sometimes it can really change the experience and bring you back into it.Be aware that there IS a learning curve. But you can take your time and practice in the tutorials or with bots (or even play co op against bots) in order to get the hang of the game. Don't expect to be a legendary player in a week and don't rush the experience it's a lot of fun to notice your improvements!I'll definitely be following Psyonix they did a great job with this one! EDIT I initially forgot to make any mention regarding the (somewhat) addition of crates and keys to unlock customization items (in other words addition of microtransactions). I'm against microtransactions and random loot crates in PC games especially in a game that sells DLCs sucessfully. It's extremely weird that Psyonix even took a step in this route.

Whilst the game doesn't showcase anything spectacular it is admittedly difficult to set such high expectations for Rocket League which aims to be nothing more than car football and they do it damn well. Its developers have maintained a close relationship with the community and built on the game since launch releasing free content alongside cosmetic DLCs and consistently providing its playerbase with QoL changes. With Psyonix's careful attention and support Rocket League has thrived and matured well. As it continues to improve with modular training coming soon there has been no better time than now for me to recommend this game with all the enthusiasm it deserves.,Rocket League®

New content every now and again introducing new game modes and ranking systems. Only downside is the xp scaling and levels required to reach the highest rank Rocketeer (73+) seems like an impossible feat. 200 hours in and I'm barely scraping Expert.Overall Great game worthy of a buy sale or not.Addition 700 hours in and still aiming for that sweet sweet rank of rocketeer. For those new to the game you will encounter a variety of toxic players (which at the gold/plat rank are very common) but if you can ignore them and focus on your own game and your own fun you will still have a blast as time goes on you will find a decent partner or group will be a massive difference.,Rocket League®

2016-12-05,0,0,368,False,Recommended,I love this game and honestly can't find any flaws with the game at all. Games are decided on players raw talent and teamwork. I find this game very different from others in one particular way reward. Sure getting cosmetics is cool and all and you get those win or lose mind you and yeah you get some cool titles to show off your in game play time but i think that the real reward is your progression as a player. Going from barely being able to hit a ball and getting lucky goals to being able to fly through the air with only the grace a rocket powered car can portray and scoring an insane ariel goal is an amazing feeling.Pros Fairly priced DLCUnlimited Skill capMultitude of game modes and mapsFresh content monthly.Cons Cases (understandable though they need to make money)Ranked can be janky sometimes,Rocket League®

2016-08-05,1,1,469,False,Recommended,I have been playing this game for a long time now so i think i m ready to give my full opinion about it.HERE WE GO!This game is a masterpiece! The game is very addictive competitive and fun. You ll have such a good time with this game if you play with friends but it s also fun on your own. Psyonix updates the game regulary so you will always have new cars/maps to play on. The game looks very good and you don t need a beast pc to run it. the controls are also easy to pick up but hard to master which makes the game a big challange. First you ll struggle to hit the ball but after a while you ll be able to perform aerials (flying goals) and dribble the ball around like it s nothing. It s also great that there is a competitive mode where you play to get a higher rank.You ll talk to your teammates and work together as one team. Teamwork is a big part of Rocket League so don t forget about it )To finish this review get the facking game you won t regret it. I promise ),Rocket League®

2015-07-20,1,1,16,False,Recommended,Rocket League is a game backed by an ingenious idea of puting super cars in a football/soccer arena. The game is well balanced giving no one the advantage at any time except for the players in the arena. This is totally worth the 20 dollars to spend and can run on a low GPU computer. (I have Intel 4600 HD) If you are debating on buying this game this review should be your influence to go ahead and buy the game because this is one of the most fun games I have ever played.

Check.Is it fun? HELL YES!I literally got so addicted the first 5 min on this game that it was insane was I hesitating to buy this? Yes but trust me it's worth every penny. If you like games where you can have a big laugh with your friends and combine any sport you like then this is the perfect game for you!!It brings a lot of cool stuff and matches where you can really have some intense moments. Sure this is much more fun when you play with more friends but it can also be pretty fun to play alone. The extra DLC's are mostly cosmetics and just for the look for new car content and cars. So if you really like the game and want to look extra pretty to beat your enemies then sure buy some their isn't any ""car improvements"" on the DLC's then those in the game. But it sure does feel different to drive. It's very well balanced even though some players can be pretty good at what their doing so it feels like their cheating when they actually don't. Hope you enjoy this game!! And I hope this review helped out choosing it.I would give this game 8/10Lilith out.",Rocket League®

2016-07-23,2,1,2322,False,Recommended,"This game is ok.... But on the real This game is absolutely one of the best games I have ever played whether you want to play this game casually or competitive this game has it all. From a season mode to freeplay to multiple maps and things called ""Mutators"" Which you are able to add effects to the game such as gravity ball size and much more. Gameplay One of my favorite thing about this game is the huge learning curve and skill cap. It takes time to learn how to aerial dribble hit it off the wall just right and just practially everything. Now lets get into how we could explain the gameplay...Well just compare it to soccer but if your playing a high level game OMG the ball can legit stay in the air for multiple seconds it's legit the only game I sweat while playing YES SWEAT it's so fast paced and I love it. Every game is different for the ball won't go in the same place every game has different saves different shots I think thats one of the best things I love about it no games are the same. Your always in to learn how to save new stuff shot new stuff in a new style of D and just multiple things. ESPORTS Yes ESPORTS this game has mega potential. MAJOR potential. But just like every esport it comes with time. Multiple people in the community are upset about how they have done with ESPORTS. I am actually not cuz I know it will come with time and will grow. It's actually very enjoyable to watch and another thing there's no shooting no blood no death. Why I'm saying this is it's ""family friendly"" Which could bring in more viewership. Not only that it's simple. Ball goes in goal thats a goal whoever has most goals wins. People can easily understand it. I think thats one of the biggest reasons I see this thing growing in time and I can't wait to see what it brings there's alot starting to be multiple tourneys pop up now. So if your looking to get into the ESPORTS scene DO IT. The scene is small right now it's YOUR CHANCE. I believe 99% this esports will become big. We just have to give it time I do think after RLCS more orgs will start picking up teams all it's gonna take is one org such as cloud9 or LG picking up a team then it will drag in more. Now this might be BIAS because I just want to see it grow. But I do believe it will come in time. Again if you want in the esports scene JUMP ON THE TRAIN NOW. ""Ranked"" I mostly play ranked because I want to improve my game and matchmaking IS so fun! Sometimes we'll get put against pro's LEGIT PRO'S and get penetrated like I've never been but sometimes we get close and win. Anyways lets get into discussion about the current state of matchmaking. I do tend to get salty at it at times ever since the reset for season 3. Reason I tend to get salty is it sucks being stuck in shooting star/all star FeelsBadman But this is because since the reset if the ""Good Players"" haven't played much there down in this rank as well we just gotta give it time and the system will fix it self. Also the hardest rank for me TO EVER get out of was Challenger Elite and I think that is the same for everyone since it kinda takes you to the next step of being in the ""Blues"" Rising star ECT. Conclusion This game is really great multiple aspects single player ranked a small but growing esports scene amazing gameplay multiple updates new dlc's AND SOON CRATES. If you guys want to learn about the crates go check out the reddit there's a really good post on it and I am personally happy for it. If we want the esports scene to grow we have to help so I won't be upset about crates but rather excited. I know this review seemed to show only the ""Good"" but I honestly can't find something I don't like other than the ranking system a little bit AT the current state. I know it will change but I'm being honest I can't find cons except maybe the community a little bit. But only in ""Solo Standard"" if your a higher rank and you have a bad game people gonna call you out or just be toxic. But thats only in solo standard which your not forced to play. Well that's about it for the review hopefully this helped you to buy or to not buy the game. If I messed up anything or you have a different opinion I would love to hear it!

The stupid physics make the game ten times better!A.I. System If an online player leaves during a game he/she is replaced with and A.I. Bot. The Bot is stupid as Hell. THey usally end up scoring own goals and crahing into the back of you just as you are about to score an awsome goal. Overall they need to improve to A.I. but it does'nt take away the enjoyment of Rocket League!To be honest it is very expencive for how much it contains but its' replayability and the fact that it is so addicting will make anyone want to come back and play it. It can get really competitve too which can make up some really intense gameplay. Like I mensioned earlier regarding the A.I. it can be improved. It is extremly annoying/frustrating when someone leaves and a mentally challenged bot replaces him/her.The game can have random lag spikes from time to time which is odd for a game that has maps that do not require too much rendering. The physics engine is laughable but so fun!Due to the bad lag spikes and frustrating bots I'm giving the game 9.5/10. It is so much fun and I have not even got the chance to play it with any of my friends yet! Friends make games like this so much better!!!!,Rocket League®

I also enjoy opening crates as you can get some rare stuff from them. The game runs smoothly on recent PCs and even low to middle end CPUs can run it. I personally have a AMD FX 4300 (upgrading) and a ZOTAC GTX 1050 and run the game very smoothly at max settings! Onto the gamepaly the game has its casual style and competivive style as well. Even at the Casual level the game still manages to maintain the intensity a COMP match has. Also a good side to the game is that you can soo many games and still have time for more! If you are playing with a group of friends perferably 3 including you play the game with strategy and looks who plays the best position and play corresponding to your results.

This game provides that YOU CAN DRIVE ON WALLS ! WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALLLLLSSSS you get all the excitement of a three hour game of Soccer in FIVE ING MINUTES. Can you say Efficiency???? Now let's say you're playing a game of soccer and there's a player on the other team that's royally you off. You're thinking to yourself I want to kill that . But the issue of murder arises and you sadly resign yourself to the fact that you can't actually kill the other player. THIS GAME PROVIDES YOU WITH THE UNIQUELY SATISFYING ABILITY OF STRAIGHT MURDERING THE OUT OF AN OPPOSING PLAYER. VALUE. CONS I think the client crashed once for me.

2015-12-27,0,0,139,False,Recommended,This game is highly addictive and worth every penny. This game is basicly a game of soccer with Rocket Cars. Each team has oppossing ends of the field. The objective of the game is to knock the ball in to the other teams goal on their side of the field as much as possible untill time runs out. There are different modes to play including a seasonal mode that you can compete to be the league champions. They also have events the current event that's going on is snow days. In snow days the ball is replaced with a puck and the field is ice. As you play you can unlock more car types rims color types toppers and more. You can play with your friends via Online Lan or local co op. Note 2 gamepads are needed to play local co op ( 1 player can not use the keyboard and mouse while the other uses a gamepad you must have 2 gamepads to play local co op)I give this game 9/10 for its addictive gameplay and replay value,Rocket League®

The graphics are amazing the customisation is fun but the best part is that the game just works and doesnt try to be something it isn't. Hopefully more game modes come out down the track but at the moment it's well worth the $20 base price tag.P.s. I recommend using a 360 controller for this however some people prefer to use the keyboard and mouse but its up to you the controller just seems less clunky to me.,Rocket League®

2015-08-16,0,0,1100,False,Recommended,This game is a must own. It is easily my favorite/most played game. The controls are great. I do recommend using a controller. The AI is pretty good when playing single player or as fill in on the non ranked multiplayer. The Multiplayer is pretty much always fun and I find that no matter what rank me and my teammates are at its always competitive. There is also a consistently large player base so finding a match doesn t take long.The best way I can describe Rocket League is it capture the feel of a sport like soccer street hockey or pretty much any fast paced competitive sport better than any sports game ever has. On top of that it is very accessible to everyone both in game play and theme. I highly recommend this game to anyone who likes good multiplayer.,Rocket League®

2015-07-25,1,1,1932,False,Recommended,"Okay I figured I would get some hours under my belt before giving a fair review of Rocket League. Currently I sit at 24hrs and I will simply say this game is pretty AMAZING. This game takes me back a decade ago when I really played the ""stuff"" out of the Hockey minigame of ATV Fury 2. This is that part game but with superior physics and on a much larger scale. For reference I'm a 36 y/o PC player and have only played 2v2 matches. There are 1v1 2v2 3v3 modes. Here is a list of Pros and Cons PROS Multiplayer Open Play or Ranked Play A phlethora of vehicle accessory unlockables Plug and Play controller support. I currently run the Logitech F310 Supports Steam Broadcasting In game verbal and text chat Single Player Season Mode. This is my favorite playmode. Easy to join multiplayer sessions. Automatically places you into a random game unless you wish to join or start a private session. Tutorial is spot on Easy to learn controls Each match is five minutes in length allowing for multiple games during one gaming session There are two camera (View) modes Ball cam on/off. Ball cam enabled is difficult to master... this is a pro because of the folly's you and others will make... adding a lot of humor to the game. The graphics are humorous and robust The ball will be your nemisis but I can't stress how awesome I find the physics. I can't tell you how many times I've seen the ball hanging in the air right in line with the goal... a perfect look.... I slam on the gas and fly into the air... only to epically fail and miss the ball by miles... smiling the whole time. This is a simple game in which you use motorized rocket cars with some serious jumping abilities guiding or hitting a giant ball into your opponents goal. Once you've mustered more than a few hours you realize there is nothing simple about this game. The controls physics camera views take a lot of time to master... I'm no where close. You hit a point where you realize how strategic this game really is. You must predict your oponents every move while trying to be a master of your own. A fast paced high flying chess match where all players pieces are always in motion.CONS Multiplayer. In my sessions I've played a lot of multiplayer ranked matches. You will have issues with teammates having latency issues due to a poor ping... Thus meaning your partner will be sitting still as a ball he doesnt see on his/her screen goes right over their heads and into the goal. You will be partnered with someone with a winning complex and upon being two goals down for whatever reason will leave the game leaving you to fend for yourself. Hopefully they will update eventually to place in a substitute player or even an AI entrant. If you are already losing you are all but guaranteed to lose a 2v1 match. There will be those teammates that are ball hawks.. always leaving the goal unattended when on defense.. and always blaming you for any misfortune and upon every look at the goal you miss will take the time to let you know how incompetent you are and how they could have easily made that shot... only for them to go on and score a goal for the opposing team and rage quit )I really haven't found anything significant to dislike about this game. My dissatisfaction comes from the multiplayer aspect but that's more on the poor personalities of certain players then the game itself. The player drop problem needs to be addressed though for ranked games to be any fun at all. Half my matches had my teammate or an opponents drop the game more than likely because the game wasn't going their way. I highly recommend this game... and if you are a mature player looking to get together for a match sometime feel free to give me a shout.",Rocket League®

2016-03-01,0,0,889,False,Recommended,"Time to make this the new League. This is one of the most amazing games I have ever played. Grab some friends grab some Controllers (not the ones from Logitech there seem to be a lot of issues with that one lately) and have fun!Only pointing out the bad things here tho 1. The matchmaking system sucks. 2 Rookies one Semi Pro one Pro against 2 Veterans and 2 Pros? No problem.Mostly it's kinda fair tho.2. Sometimes you are put in a 0 5 game. There should be some kind of auto ending a match that's 5 0 or so when none of the losing team's original players are still in the game.3. Man the DLCs are expensive.4. As mentioned above certain Controllers don't work with Rocket league. My XBox Controllers are working fine tho although it won't take long until Steam thinks of something else to make us buy their Controller lol5. Sometimes it takes ages for you to find a match as most guys are playing Double Rankeds. And I don't have friends. jkOne HUGE additional! Plus for the game is the option to play local Splitscreen (using two controllers of the same kind) on TWO MONITORS! Get in the game choose ""Borderless (window)"" quit the game right click on your desktop go to your monitor options and choose that ""advance this screen"" or whatever it is in English to make your desktop viewable on both of your monitors. Now go on ""Documents"" ""MyGames"" ""Rocket League"" ""TAGame"" ""Config"" and open ""TASystemSettings"" with an Editor like NotePad++. Now search for ""ResX ____"" and ""ResY ____"".Change the number at ResX to the sum of both of your monitors' width and ResY to the lower of your two monitors' height. An example I am using two full HD monitors so my options are ""ResX 3840"" and ""ResY 1080"" as 1920 x 2 3840 and the height of both monitors is equal and 1080. Now start the game it should work. If you want to change back to solo screen just choose ""Full Screen"" in the Video Options. You are welcome.",Rocket League®

2017-04-17,0,0,38,False,Recommended,Best game in the universe (my opinion).I've had so much fun flying about in rocket powered battle cars flinging a huge ball in to each others goals.I've never really liked football but this is just on a completly new level its so fun.You can even make your own games and play with friend like hide and seek or tag just go to mutator settings and make it your own.There is such a variety of maps with their own uneque shapes and sizes and there is even a basket ball map for all those people who are more in to basket ball or even ice hockey.One of the best parts is the freedom of customizing your own car but you just can't create a car it's only the colours antennas and even hats.i also love the rumble mode its absulutly amazing you can use all different kinds of abilitys like spikes and grapple pull .These two abilitys are probobly the best ones because the spikes make the ball stick to the car and it lasts quite a long time and the grapple pull brings you in untilyou hit the ball.When you hit the ball it flys of in the direction you hit it with extreme speed.I personally think it's the best for the goalies.,Rocket League®
2017-05-12,0,0,658,False,Recommended,So after playing 60+ hours on this game and played everysingle game mode it s time for me to write a review.This is a really fun/good game but if you want to play seriously be ready because you got to put a lot of effort in order to get good at this game.This game as really good graphics but if you haven t a really good pc there s no problem turn the video settings down a little bit and the game still looks awesome.The cars has a lot of modding even without DLC s and like that.Rocket League has kinda good servers what I mean by that it s like some players don t connect for some weird reason and you just stand there with your car on the field for quite some time and you have to start the queue all over again.The game has really short loading screens which I like a lot.The Community itself has made maps for training like flying with your car defend that sort of stuff which is awesome in order to get good in this game.Totally worth it to pay 20 bux for this game even without your friends it s fun AF!,Rocket League®
2016-12-31,0,0,65,False,Recommended,This is a great for people of any skill level and dedication. You can play a few hours a week as something casual to mess around in. You can spend 10 or 20 minute bits of time here and there for a quick pickup game. I'm sure people spend hundreds of hours learning the ins and outs to play like a pro. Local split screen is awesome!

2016-01-17,0,0,68,False,Recommended,Rocket League My Favorite Multiplayer Game of 2015 Overview Rocket League is an incredibly fun game to play with friends easily being my favorite multiplayer game of 2015. The game is great fun regardless of whether or not you like sports. It's also receiving plenty of support from the developers with new maps and game modes being added for free and the only paid DLC being cosmetic. Pros Great fun for both casual and more serious players Cross platform multiplayer Splitscreen local and online multiplayer Very good performance even on lower end hardware A majority of the game in multiplayer is handled by dedicated servers so cheaters are rare if there are any All DLC is purely cosmetic with plenty of free cosmetic unlocks available in the base game and all new maps and game modes being completely free Steam Workshop support coming soon Cons No support for resolutions 1440p or higher without an INI edit Limited anti aliasing options,Rocket League®

2016-04-25,0,0,189,False,Recommended,So having played this briefly in the free weekend I fell in love and had to buy it. Such a simple game but yet so brilliant. Awesome fun time with friends. Even in the current 14hrs I have when writing this review I can see that its an amazing game. Good points Simple yet fun Hats Good graphics (Unreal engine) Good physics for an arcade game Plenty of customization options to make your car stand out Devs are consistant with updates adding new things like different arenas/game types Loading times are quick and the servers seem very good no connection issues yet Soundtrack is really goodBad points (really had to nit pick to find bad points) Hate your friends when they steal your goal Could do with a little bit more to the progression other than just customization but I'm ok with this Maybe more vehicles could also be added in the 14hrs I've played I've already unlocked all the cars (other than DLC) The game is also heavily controller based I haven't personally tried playing with the keyboard but I'm guessing it probably wont be easy Everyone who plays online are extreamly salty even if you are loosing by one goal all your team leaves this is by no way the games fault just the stupid people of the earthThis is one of those games that is really easy to pick up and play but harder to master. The replayability of the game is also good found myself always jumping on just for a quick game to then find myself playing 5 6. So yeah buy the game play with friends have a lot of fun...,Rocket League®

It does get repetitive but the 4 different modes of which change the amount of players affects the gameplay immensely. 1 vs 1 is more methodical where 4 vs 4 (aptly named Chaos ) is just endless bumping and boosting.If you want a game you can easily pick up and play any time of day for 5 minutes or for 5 hours then get this game.Killjoys need not apply.,Rocket League®

Rocket League is the first game I can remember in the last 5+ years that I just can't get enough of and what's great about it is that the 5 minute matches are perfect for someone like me who can't always commit to a 45 60 minute game. Easy to understand and hard to master this game is amazing from casual splitscreen on the couch to competitive 3v3.,Rocket League®
2017-02-08,0,0,373,False,Recommended,"By far one of the best games in my library. I recomand trying it out with a controller though. So I will write an in depth review of this game called Rocket League in wich I spent around 270 hours going trough many ranked leagues.Graphics Awesome! I'm not looking for graphics in a competitive game which comes with a lot of action so I don't spend that much time looking around but I am satisfied about the looking of the cars which come with soooo many options to pick! Boosts are awesome decals are awesome (if you can get a animated one OMG IT LOOKS SO GOOD) car models are of all types and affordable that you can get for a really cheap price and you will 100% enjoy!Physics Collisions and hitboxes can be improved but those are good enough to not have a game breaking impact you miss a goal because you hit the ball in a wierd possition and it jumps across the map with 10000 kmph but that's ok it happens )Once you get the ability to fly you will be so satisfied when you score an aerial goal omg it's so exciting! All the wall jumps and freestyles that you can do bring so much excitement only if you try you can jump off your chair! Even after 270 hours I am still learning and enjoying this game!Community Surprisingly good! Many of the guys that i've met in 1v1's even came with me in a private practice to teach me how to hit an aerial or such there are often guys that bm you with a ""What a save!"" when you miss but other than that you are not going to see game after game ""kys"" or flaming non stop. It's definetly a great community that I love a lot! You can find so many friends that you can play duo's and have fun.Personal enjoyinment 9/10.I don't know if it's just me but I start winning around 4 5 games in a row I get in a good division (about 2 3 rank ups) and after I get matched with a whole new level of experienced players! *and I start dropping ofc*Ranking system can be a little bit improved you win and lose a lot 2 wins can get you a division down and 3 wins can get you a division up so in 30 minutes you can even go up a league! (or go down one ))But I love this game it's 100% worth the 20$ and the DLC's I just love it and I play it daily.",Rocket League®

2016-12-15,0,0,556,False,Recommended,A very fun game!Its extremely entertaining when playing alone and even more entertaining when playing with friends! Seeing each other fail and/or score sick goals is really shining in this game. Its fast paced and loaded with action. You will hardly get bored even after many hours even though the game does not change. Its still never the same game. Every game is different and is special in a certain way. The esport scene of this game is also amazing for everyone that is interested. You can learn a lot from all the pro players and I found rocket league to be even more entertaining to watch than most sports!On top of that as long as you dont tryhard in ranked games the frustration level is very low. If you win or lose in normal games doesnt really matter since you get XP anyways. In my first 50 hours of play I had so much fun even when losing since there was something to giggle about in nearly every match.Now after more than 100 hours the fun is still there no doubt! But since starting in ranked games (mid ground blue star in every category) things get a little more salty. Players can get very toxic and shout at you for not playing the way they want but I guess thats a typical thing every game suffers from. All in all this is a great game to kill some boring hours and have great fun with friends!,Rocket League®

Even my wife enjoyed it wtf?Had some matchmaking issues for a while where I was getting 300+ ping players however thats much more of a rare occurence.The disable ps4 player matchmaking is great (cross play) as you would expect them to be less focussed with people walking in front of the TV and the like.I wish they would post the car stats As they are clearly different. Most noticably in turning radius using handbreak or while boosting.For the money this has been massively entertaining. As simple as it is (which some people whinge about) I am still quite unskilled at it after 40 odd hours which does indicate it has some depth.One of the most exciting games to play for me in my library and always a great choice when im sick of everything else or a bit too buggered to concentrate on something more serious.,Rocket League®

2015-08-30,0,0,63,False,Recommended,"An absolute blast. Fun to play and even more fun with friends.It plays like you're controlling radiocontrolled cars with boosters who can jump and then flip while airborne. The best and most streamlined variant of a kind of ""Mario Kart 8"" meets ""Fifa XX"".Add to that a streamlined interface customization clear design that gives you the information you need while you play and a huge 'income stream' of customization items that gives you loot after almost every single round whether you win or loose and this is easily worth you money.One of the most fun I've had with multiplayer games in a long time showing off both the game designers itself and what an excellent tool Unreal 4 seems to be. About one dozen people made this.I've yet to play the singleplayer and don't see a reason to do so yet. Still worth it.",Rocket League®

2017-05-27,2,1,795,False,Recommended,Bought the game sometime in 2015 and thought it would be a good game to play here and there on my own. Then it became so addicting that I played it pretty much everyday. Then I got a friend to purchase it as well and he enjoyed it to. Now still playing with the same person I have clocked over 200hrs into the game and am still bad at it.Pros Easy to pick up but hard to master Replayable (for hours) Reliable servers Lots of customization Cheap DLC cars if you want to buy them Good crate system as it feels you will always get something goodCons Triggers easily Sometimes you get unfair matchmaking where it will be an Expert Veteran and Pro vs 3 Experts and you get destroyed Different for everyone but I have to use a controller to play so you will have to get a controller to play the game well unless you are mad with a keyboard and mouse Can't trade in Very Rare items which I really want in the gameOverall this is game is my favourite on steam and I am sure going to be playing it for many many more hours.

2015-07-16,0,0,240,False,Recommended,I saw a lot of hype for this game recently sinced it released so I decided to buy it because it was only $20 and I can say it was a great $20 well spent. The game is essentially soccer with cars that can jump and boost. With that being said it offers short and sweet matches around 5 minutes long. Those 5 minutes are crazy fun and hectic. When I first played online after the training I was having so much fun when I scored goals or demolished another person's car. In the game there is also some cool car customization but in my experience the crazier your car looks the more is stands out. Overall I really like this game and I haven't had this much fun with a game in a while. I will be recommending it to my friends and hope this game gets more recognition!,Rocket League®

I for one who hates car games found myself sitting at my computer and laguhing cheering and dancing to my teams success but of course all good games have flaws. The camera can be glitchy The CPU's can be overwhelmingly easy or hard or just stupid. The stunts are super difficult to pull off but if you do the joy is there.

2016-05-09,0,0,302,False,Recommended,Ok so rocket league is a pretty damn fun game so let's go over the pros and cons PROS Great gameplay with very few bugs Very well optimised had no trouble getting 60fps on ultra with my gtx 750ti Amazing Graphics Great soundtrack Active developers that make regular updatesCONS The AI in singleplay can be a bit stupid sometimes scoring own goals and the like Matchmaking is messed up. The game will often be unbalanced with newer players on one team and much more experienced players on the other. Not to mention a lot of players who are Masters often create new steam accounts and play the game on those as a rookie therefore making it hard for legitimate new players to get points (though this is more of a problem with the community not the game itself)Overall a great game and worth the money but be prepared for frustration along the journey to Master level,Rocket League®

2016-11-23,0,0,816,False,Recommended,Rocket League. The game combining cars soccer and rocket boosters. The funnest game (and I'm not exaggerating) i've ever played probably in my life. Easy to start and figure out as you play against other people but can be very challenging and stylish as you go on. When I found Rocket League I was a tad skeptical but VERY enthusiastic. I am so glad I decided to spend $20 on this incredible game and would've spent more on it if it was more expensive. Now there have been bugs and very frustrating times I have experienced and have seen others experience but it was all worth it in the end. And with new features being added constantly new maps new gamemodes new cars and now cases the game has become all the more better (although some people dislike the crates system). Overall I'd give this game an incredible 9.5/10 for amazing gameplay amazing multiplayer nice soundtrack great community hundreds and hundreds of hours of fun and just being overall an incredible game. The only thing I think may need some work is maybe some more Singleplayer features but besides that incredible game get it try it it's worth it. Note though alothough I think this is an amazing game you may not think so so try and look at more reviews to get more of a perspective of what this game is worth and how fun it is. D,Rocket League®

2016-06-27,1,1,866,False,Recommended,Have you ever gotten the feeling that some videogames feel more like chore than actually fun? Well Rocket League is msot certainly not one of them. Regardless of if you're amazingly good or you suck at it you can easily have a ton of fun at it. It's one of the most refreshingly new concepts for a game.For some people it feels like it allows you to finely tune your skills to the game. Every time you play you can feel you're getting better at it and developing these awesome techniques. And for others it's none of that! It's one of the sillies funnest games out there where suddenly you're about to score an awesome goal and your team mate bashes into your car and launches you across the court. It's all good tho beacuse 20 seconds later you can do it back to him. In a matter of hours you're already making friends and my experience with it is that if you're generally relaxed and non toxic the community really comes forward. Players are eager to find teamates for fun games. I've made some of my best friends in this game.Oh and did I mention the developers? They are constantly hearing the players and working on ways to get more in touch with them and offer them tools and solutions to problems.The only problems with it are firstly it's matchmaking which functions in a way only understandable for Nazis or demons. Also if you have friends in XBone don't expect to play with them any time soon because Microsoft tends to have a similar minset to that of Hitler. You also might find the occasional bully who will belitle the noobs and insult everyone but that's expected in any multiplayer game.Tuly my favorite game of all time. And I'd type more about it if I weren't as lazy. But to sum up it's a fantastic game for it's refreshing gameplay combined with great skill allowance open non toxic comunnity and in touch developers.10/10 must buy.,Rocket League®

2016-12-09,0,0,1676,False,Recommended,Rocket League is hard to compare to most games due to its nature. The short 5 minute games allow you to play back to back for hours or just a few during a study break. There are so many different skill levels and even though i still remember not being able to fathom actually shooting a ball into the net now aerials and dribbles are second nature. Matchmaking has its flaws although overall it can never be perfect. My only critism is the report a player feature I've encountered the same player many times throughout my near 1000 hours and he is the most toxic and outright disgusting player. I have reported him nearly every game along with many others and yet nothing is done. This leads me to believe nothing is actually done in regards to these reports.

2015-12-16,0,0,136,False,Recommended,Be careful buying this game. Once you pick it up you will get one more game syndrome. It s really that fun to play. The games are quick and even if you lose you watch every score replay and try to see what you did so you can get better. This is a fun game solo but it s even better with a group of friends! That being said you can play local or go online with a split screen group and have a great time if your system can handle it!Rocket League is easy to pick up and with a little bit of work you can really do amazing things in this game. The skill cap is as high as you want to take it and trust me this is one of those games that you will see yourself in the training section practicing because you want to get better!I have not really run into any highly toxic players of note just people that give up and quit out. On top of that it also has cross play with the Playstation Network and has been rumored to be headed to the Xbox One so I don t see the community fading away quickly on this game.For the $20 this game currently costs I would highly recommend it.

2017-04-09,0,0,205,False,Recommended,PROS Love this game!! I was a little skeptical at first because after all it's a game about cars but it was highly recommended to me by a friend so when I built my first PC I decided to give it a try. I AM NOW OBSESSED! It's never ending fun trying to improve your own skills and work with teammates to grind to those higher ranks. There is also an awesome trading community which I love. It's so much fun to try and collect the best looking and rarest items. There are so many fun gamemodes which are all hard to master but can be really fun. CONS People in this game can be kind of toxic. Scratch that VERY TOXIC is what I meant to say. Sometimes you will have nice competitive matches with respectful players but other times (at least at my skill level) there are players who wont hesitate to make fun of you with the very sarcastic chat commands. When I first started this made me question if I really did suck at the game because 75% of the time I would completely whiff which is actually normal for new players I later found out. Don't get discouraged when people spam you with What a save! when you miss the ball or Nice Shot! when you score an own goal. For the first about 15 hours I had on this game it wasn't very fun but after you reach a certain level this game is amazing.,Rocket League®

The games are nice and quick so you don't have to worry about investing hours of time in one sitting.I own both the Steam version and the PS4 version and play both regularly with a slight preference to the Steam version (better visuals and extremely smooth on my gaming rig).

2015-08-18,0,0,25,False,Recommended,"This game is great.Its cars that play football.What else do you need to know?Its easy to get a hang of but difficult to master.Matches last 5 minutes (a bit more if its a tie score) so its a great game to play when you dont have much time to play.You can customize everything on your car from the body type to tires exaust flames car stripes flags and hats.You unlock stuff simply by playing a match so the more you play the more stuff you unlock.The game is fun and adictive so you can easly lose a couple of hours playing it without even noticing.If you want to play it with your friends but they dont have the game its ok just give them controlers and you can pretty much split screen play with them from the same account either local offline versus modes or even online matches.The maximum number of players that you can have in your team is 4 and the minimum is one so you can pretty much play with whatever group size you want.My only gripe with the local players is that you cannot rename them.Your profile name becomes theirs aswell with the added ""(number)"" next to their name.I really wish that they could add renaming option to the game that would make it even better.All in all this game is a 10/10 from me because it gives you great time playing solo or can be a great party game that you can play with your friends online or localy.Im giving this game 10/10 and have to add that this is one of the games that you have to have in your steam library.Its worth every penny.",Rocket League®

2016-04-01,0,0,894,False,Recommended,On first loading the game I was having a lot of fun batting the ball around with other noobs. Then I saw someone fly up in the air and hit the ball and I realized there was more to this than meets the eye initially. The skill ceiling in this game is ridiculous as the best player would have to instantly predict the path of the ball when someone hits it AND move into the right position and pull off the shot. 225 hours in I can make some pretty sick shots but I still am learning and there is still a long ways to go. The early gameplay all takes place on the ground and can feel like a bunch of dogs chasing a car but as skill/time progresses the strategy seeps in and you can hit the ball higher in the air from further away. Instead of chasing the ball you know whether to make a play or fall back and can pull off increasingly better defensive plays and shots/passes. If you get frustrated by having inconsiderate or noob teammates this game will probably frustrate you. Ball chasing teammates can ruin the game but luckily the games only last 5 minutes and there is unranked play that you can join or leave freely.,Rocket League®

Sure there are more impressive games by terms of scope and innovation but few games have ever made me just smile like a Cheshire Cat for hours upon end like Rocket League.This game makes you feel like a moron at times and a hero at others. Dumb luck and spectacular displays of skill are sometimes one in the same.Sometimes people describe games as ""tight"" and this game should be the definition of tight game design going forward. There's not a single game mechanic or system that isn't honed to perfection. This game gleems with the sharpness of a surgeon's scalpel. This is my desert island game.",Rocket League®
2015-08-01,0,0,1482,False,Recommended,This game is basically playing soccer (football) with race cars in a nutshell. But underneath the surface it's so much more. It's so easy to pick up and start playing and difficult to master. It's everything you could look for in a competitive sports game and more. But you don't like competitive sports games you say? Don't let that stop you. Whether you play as a casual player or a hardcore competitive player you'll find something to like. And did I mention how fun it is? Oh my god it's a blast. Even better if you bring your friends.Also this is one of the few multiplatform games out there with the game being available on both the PC and Playstation 4. Mouse/Keyboard or Gamepad the controls are slick and work great. Although I find gamepad easier to use for this game (works great with Xbox 360 controller). It's probably gonna be considered one of this year's biggest surprise hits. It has a high Metacritic score for a reason. Don't wait for a Steam sale. BUY IT NOW! Highest recommendation! Seriously.

It is a server side problem and is caused by unoptimized physics and/or network code. It usually ruins your game and occurs every 20 40 seconds (mainly on crowded EU servers as I found out).

If you have then imagine that but at 4 times the speed with cars that can jump and boost to even more ludicrous speeds in an arena where driving on the walls is not only allowed but encouraged! This game is pure no nonsense balls to the wall fun whether you like football or not (I don't much like it personally) you will have a lot of fun with this. The handling of the cars of just the right level of arcadey fun that you always feel in control and you very quickly get to grips with the camera which does about as good a job as it can trying to keep up with the ball! Once you have the basics of the game down there are plenty of tricks you can pull to keep the ball away from the opponents and going toward their goal. On top of these there is lots of neat car customization which includes the usual decals flags wheels and boost smoke colour and of course the hats! Hey it works for TF2 so why not put a hat on your car )There are a couple of modes exhibition and season vs the AI which is the best way to start playing until you start to figure out how stuff works and then there is the online mode.

2016-02-16,0,0,349,False,Recommended,"It's car soccer. Do you really need any other reason for wanting this game?For those still reading Rocket League is the epitome of video games that I could ever ask for. It's easy to learn and very hard to master. You can have fun regardless of your skill level whether you are just flinging your car at the ball in a 4v4 bunch ball rugby match or if you've mastered the art of manipulating the boost to fly across the map and score a clutch goal in 2v2 ranked. The learning curve is very smooth as it allows you to test out all kinds of things from first learning how to fly with boost to getting the right angle to block a shot without just sucking the fun out of exploring the nuances of the game. There is ranked casual a single player season and now rocket labs are being introduced which are different maps that can really stretch your knowledge of angles whether the map has turned into a circle or the goal has split into two different halves at a 45 degree angle or terraces are added to the sides completely screwing over any concept of car physics you ever knew.Games are 5 minutes each which definitely has the ""just one more game"" appeal to it as you can either have an amazing game and follow it up with another while you're hot or have a terrible game and want to end on a good note. It's not quite so bad that you will just casually burn through an entire afternoon playing it but is definitely good enough to play out for an hour or two.Perhaps the most compelling reason for me stating that it is the epitome of a video game is that it's all for fun. The skins are internal to the system so there's no trading. Rankings can be compared to friends but overall don't mean that much. This game is definitely at it's best when you just have a group of friends using some loose coordination to pull off spectacular plays and more importantly the epic failures that lead to spamming ""What a save!"" when your teammate completely whiffs and the other team scores in overtime to win the game.",Rocket League®

2016-02-08,0,0,31,False,Recommended,This game is amazing.I remember first seeing this game and being attracted to it.I had watched only two videos on the game at the time of purchase and these were both livestreams specifically the nerd3 mass debates.Upon buying downloading and installing this game i was greeted with Great visuals (Ok they're not the best but they suit the style of game) Great controls! (if you use a controller the devs recommend a controller) Moderate customisability (unlock customizations by playing games all the car bodies are already unlocked for you) not to mention there are no performance upgrades so its a fair pitch. All cars are the same speed but some are bigger than others making it easy to hit the ball but the bigger vehicles have a wider turning circle.And now we come on to the community. The community is great! If you are lucky you will get an enemy team that will compliment you on your goals (i do this frequently) there is also sometimes a bit of banter in the chat.The main menu music is good too personally i prefer hollywood principle's firework but its up to you.

2016-06-29,0,0,1589,False,Recommended,TL DR It's fantastic easy to pick up difficult to master.I have played probably 250 hours in this game (I have played a ton with friends on their consoles and PCs so those hours aren't on my Steam total). I have probably spent 100 hours just watching people play Rocket League including tutorials and professional competitions such as the Rocket League Championship series. Because of these two things I think I have enough experience to credibly give a full review of the game.Pros Easy to pick up. The basic controls are very simple I would say simpler than Mario Kart. The rules are incredibly simple 5 minute games get the ball in the net more than your opponent. Instantly addicting gameplay. I have several friends who do not play games at all and still play Rocket League several times a week. The game is fast and gorgeous and every goal feels like an accomplishment. Huge amount of depth. I've spent more time on this game than any other I've played with the exception of The Witcher 3 and I would not consider myself anywhere close to mastery. Learning advanced mechanics such as powersliding flying dribbling fast kickoffs etc. opens up whole new levels of play and learning the elements of strategy such as positioning and rotations is key to being a top player. None of the top players in the game (some with more than a thousand hours) are even close to the skill cap yet and new techniques are being discovered by players. Robust online play. For casual players there are modes that can be played without regard to rank and some modes that are different than the standard competitive modes such as hoops (basketball) snowday (hockey) and chaos (4v4). Hopping into a match is quick and easy and there is endless replayability in these matches. Hopping onto the competitive scene provides challenge to people who want to prove themselves and get better eventually becoming champions. Since the matches are only 5 minutes long it is very easy to squeeze one or twelve matches into a spare few minutes. Cool collectibles. There are tons of boosts toppers decals paint and antennas that can be earned by playing and cars are very customizable. Certain items are earned from reaching a new ranking level before the season ends. There is a fun little trade in system to earn more rare items by discarding some more common ones. I would love to see some expansion on this with more items but there are so many right now it is difficult to complain. Built in training system. There are modes that allow free play goalie striker and aerial training which are quickly accessible and useful for building skill and training for more advanced skills. There are also modes which allow games against bots when for training or when offline play is the only option. Very active developers. I have to give a shout out to Psyonix for giving this game the life it deserves. The developers hear the complaints of the players and fix issues with the game and are constantly adding new content (collectible cars and maps). Growing eSports community. There are some people who believe it or not make lots of money playing Rocket League. There are professional players right now playing in one of the world's largest eSports tournaments the Rocket League Championship Series (RLCS). This game is the perfect game to be an eSport because it is very viewer friendly and has spectating built in. There are new tournaments for Rocket League starting all the time. Pioneer for cross platform play. Players on PC Xbone and PS4 can all play with each other and against each other online. Play with friends in a lobby regardless of the platform.Cons Must have a good internet connection. Playing online is very difficult if your internet connection sucks. I would recommend having 120 ping or less. Some small bugs. The few bugs that pop up very rarely almost never affect gameplay but spectating can have a couple issues with the camera and nametags.I think that about sums up the game. It is by far my favorite sports or online game and one of the best games I have ever played. Worth it for the casual or hardcore.,Rocket League®

2016-07-18,0,0,840,False,Recommended,"With (at time of writing) 266 hours of game time I think it's fair for me to put down my verdict.+ Great graphics (for those interested). This game doesn't get boring to look at and I have a feeling it has one of those timeless designs that will still look good as the years fo on.+ Fantastic attention to detail. Small swaying grass tire skids tire squeaks on the Basketball mode and outside the arena fountains that are fully animated clock that actively counts down the time. Despite mostly looking at the ball when playing the game there's plenty to notice if you stop and look around. Stress on ""if"". + Low barrier for entry. Unlike MOBAs which pretty much require mastery before your first game it's easy to hop into a match and do decently. Just have the right attitude and you're good to go.+ High skill ceiling. There are still moves being discovered. Early on it was aerials. Then pinches. Now rooftop dribbling and Freestyles. I wonder what's coming in next!+ Excellent Dev Communication. Active on both the forums and subreddit and regularly interacting with fellow members. + No Pay To Win DLC. The cars you get free are just as good as those you buy. And end of the day all you need is skill. Multiplayer matchmaking. As of now you either get a game really quick but with poor competition or after a long while with good competition. At times with opponents that easily overpower you. Have patience though. Slightly toxic community. It used to be better hopefully doesn't get much worse. I'd recommend disabling your level tag (the one that says You're a Master Rookie etc) as too many people think experience skill. You get experience from playing bot matches too so it doesn't exactly translate. Easy bots. Playing on All Star (which is the highest it gets) and you can still pretty much win easily. They're best for warmups or early days so I wouldn't say it's a bad thing.Overall this is definitely a game that everyone should try. There's a huge playerbase now with the crossplatform multiplayer (at times the lowest I've seen is 10000 in Asia East and SE Mainland two regions I frequently select) and highest being 28000 in the unranked public playlist. Once you learn the tricks of the game how to play what position and so on along with the camarederie you build with total random strangers it really is something special. One game you may barely touch the ball. The next you're scoring a wall jump aerial. It's that great. Definitely recommend.",Rocket League®

Good enough community. micro transactions only offer new skins cars etc. You buy the whole game and you miss NOTHING. You loot an object at the end of EVERY GAME. Even if you lost. In a good 10hrs of play you can fully customize any car the way you want. Finished and polished game very few bugs. PS4 and PC can play together via Psynet. Isn't that wonderful. No lag felt during matches.Cons You HAVE to have a controller. Unplayable with keyboards. If someone quits a competitive match you'll be screwed bots can only attack and are mindless. If you miss goals make big mistakes while in competitive you'll get bashed and insulted. But that's in prospect not the whole game ... no communication besides pre programmed interactions between PS4 and PC players.In overall it can be fun with friends or a highly competitive game.

As a multiplayer experience the game is pretty much faultless imo. The only a couple of things that seems to really spoli the experience is the match making sometimes it won't put you on a local server your ping will be horrible and you'll rubberband like crazy.In additon if you get lumbered with an AI teammate in a 3v3 the handicap is huge. Single player is a little disapointing the AI literally don't seem to care if they're on your team and are a hinderance. For example I had 2 season matches where my AI teammate scored no less than 2 goals they weren't accidental tap ins either they were purposeful dribbles up the pitch to score. I had to start defending against my own AI team mates! o,Rocket League®

I've not been into any kind of sports related games since NHL games on 16 bit consoles in the 90's. I did eventually play it and I only wish I'd done it sooner.This really is a game like no other and after over 500 hours of playing I'm still learning new stuff (while forgetting how to do the old).

2016-09-17,0,0,1813,False,Recommended,I love this game to bits! On paper this might sound like a simple and silly game but after 480+ hours I can easily say that this game is anything but. And I can't say enough about the Devs Psyonix they are just the best. I have had this game for over a year now and have seen many free content updates maps modes and customizables alike. This game is a steal for $20!The first few times you play you will probably be very confused and the camera really takes some getting used to. But don't worry because RL has a great matchmaking system that will see you match with equally skilled players (most of the time). After you have a few hours of practice and you have the basics down I suggest heading over to YouTube for some begginer tutorials. It's a quick way to learn how to better control the ball and in no time you will be the MVP of your matches. Once you feel comfortable enough you can try out the ranked matchmaking system which is a competetive league compared to the unranked system which doesn't count towards your ranked level. Another great thing about this game is its tremendous Esports value. Where other Esports games like CSGO Overwatch and LOL are sometimes hard to follow and understand Rocket League is just completely different. It opens a whole new door in Esports as probably the easiest game to understand (the ball goes into the goal and you score 1 point). It's just incredible to watch the pros play this game and see the things they can do. I'm sure I have much more to get out of this game and I am so thankful that Devs like this still exist &lt 3. Thanks Psyonix and keep up the good work!,Rocket League®

Despite all of that I still play it because it's fun.",Rocket League®

Get It!Detailed Review Positive (aspects) Variety of Arenas to play in (more are still coming thanks to Rocket Lab) Many customization options for your RC car Ranking system is similar to CSGO (play first 10 games before getting a rank) DLCs are optional and does not affect gameplay (Cosmetic DLCs are the greatest NOT Pay to Win) Gameplay is fun and refreshing every match (because it's a Sports game) Training Mode (allows you to practice new moves and improve old ones) Season and Exhibition Mode (for those who wants to play Single Player or warm up before playing Online) Stats Page (to see your Win/Lose % and amount of MVPs) Replay Page (to watch your best matches... duhhhhhhh)Negative (aspects) Random drops in FPS Random temporary disconnection in game (major problem when playing competitive because every second counts)As a result this game proves that Indie game developer can do just as well (or BETTER) than AAA game companies.Nice Shot!Nice Shot!Nice Shot!Chat disabled for 5 seconds.,Rocket League®

Rocket league may seem like a simple innocent game at first but behind this is a massive skill curve which can require a LOT of practice.

2017-01-17,0,0,618,False,Recommended,Oh boy..here we go...Being a fan of soccer I LOVE THIS GAME and i like RC cars too the question is would i recommend the game to a friend? Yea i think i would. Its easy enough to just pick up and play and alot of fun when you play with friends but the match making.....sheesh....could use some work. I have 300+ hours in this game so its about time i wrote a review....I am blue star and consider myself an above average player who likes to play defensive (which im scorned for but i saved the team's butt on a number of occations but noone cares about that) and then all out assault with a counter attack WHICH USUALLY WORKS!! BUT!!! I keep getting matched with players below me and players of the same rank who i have no idea how they got there. ANyway thats a personal gripe to the point....Pros Fluid Gameplay Easy to pick up Fun with friends Perfect for Lan Parties Visuals amazing Arenas colorful and relaxing NOT PAY TO WIN all DLC are asthetic ONLY!!!!Cons Camera angles Getting used to switching on and off ball tracking Hitboxes being different in each car Custom arenas that just make the ball bounces impossible to predict Pinches and physics of the ball just being totally random at times Single Player is useless to play unless its just for practice. NO SINGLE PLAYER CO OP!!!!I would still recommend this game and its out of 10 ratio would be as followsEase of picking up the game 8/10Gameplay 8/10Multiplayer 8/10Community 4/10 (its just the toxic playerbase of league of legends YE BE WARNED!)Beauty 10/10Skill Based game 9/10 (except for those totally crazy pinches)Overal Recommend and would buy again!!!,Rocket League®

2015-10-22,0,0,552,False,Recommended,This has been one of the biggest if not THE biggest surprises of the year for me. The moment I played it I was hooked. This is a very well balanced casual and competitive game with a towering skill ceiling. It has been a real joy to see my skill improve from day one to now over one hundred hours of gameplay. There are a variety of cars to choose from which all behave the same for the most part (there are slight differences in the hitboxes and turn radii afaik) and you can also customize these cars with paint schemes skins hats wheels and antennas (these do not change car performance). You can choose to play 1v1 up to 4v4 either casually or competitively with a rankings ladder and all of the maps look great but have the same layout (devs have mentioned adding more unusual layouts in the future). I was on the fence about this game for a month or so after release but I am kicking myself for not picking this up earlier. I have played 104 hours and the game hasn't become stale. Rocket League is pure unadulterated fun. P.S. As of this writing there are 3 DLC packs available at reasonable prices that add nothing but new vehicles and cosmetic options.,Rocket League®

2015-09-19,1,1,1191,False,Recommended,Rocket League is great! Yes it has some issues but all games do. Rocket League offers excitement competition fun with friends and a lot more. I play every day(at least once) because of how much fun it is! I almost exclusively play ranked matches. Ranked Season 1 definitely isn't built well but the changes for Season 2 (starting in February) look awesome! Ranked Season 1 is just based on the number of points you have and you gain or lose points each game depending on whether you win or lose. Season 2 is supposed to be based on your skill taking more into consideration when ranking you. I can't wait for Season 2 and I do not see myself stopping playing this game any time soon!EDIT I've had the game for nearly 3 years now and I'm still playing it almost daily. It's still so much fun with how much you can do with your car (I think the possibilities are almost literally limitless)! Definitely recommend this game to ANYONE who likes to play video games. Feel free to send me a message or anything if you have questions!,Rocket League®

2017-07-06,0,0,7,False,Recommended,Usually game trailers make the game look better than it actually is (advertising duh). Rocket league however is the first game i've owned that is as good as the trailers for it! It contains exciting fast paced gameplay and a whole community dedicated to it behind the 15 pound payment. There is the perfect amount of DLC and some of the car combinations look very cool B). I haven't gone online with rocket league yet because it may take tens of hours of practice to start hitting balls... The only thing i would say about this game is that you need at least two controllers to do multiplayer but couldn't a second player use j k l i and left shift to control their car. I'd like this because i don't want to pay for controllers altough for an epic game like this i just might... don't update just yet Psyonix...,Rocket League®

2015-08-10,0,0,57,False,Recommended,This game is very funny!It is about playing a football match but it is not a normal match it is much more.You can just controll a smal car which can do a jump in all directions and even a doublejump in all directions.Moreover you can collect nitro and use it to be faster. With that little car you need to hit the ball in the goal which can be hard but it is always funny at all.There are even some skins in the garage possible... so you can pick a car give it wheels a color stripes and an extra.You can even set up how you nitro boost looks like. Therefore you can collect many items by playing and leveling upyou game account on rocket league.There is also online mode and a competitive mode so i will never get boring agaisnt online players. ),Rocket League®

2016-09-15,0,0,1098,False,Recommended,I recommend this game This game is a great game. It has a wide variety of cars and items to add to your car such as hats and antennas. With the items in the game you can create over a whopping 10 billion car combinations! There are a few different game modes you can play and Psyonix just recently added a new funny and exciting game mode called Rumble . You have two teams orange and blue. The main objective for each team of course is to score the most goals. It has a lot of game modes but each one is similar and for some people this could get boring. However I have 500+ hours on the game and I still enjoy it as much as I did when I played my first match.Some people think the price is a bit expensive but for me it couldn't be better. You can't complain at a great game for a price of 15 when there are others out there for 25 40 and they aren't even good. Also the DLC's are pretty good the price range being around 1 2.50.BUY IT!!,Rocket League®

I've found that as you play the game you'll master more tricks. I've gotten pretty good in the few (few meaning 58) hours that I've played Rocket League. The developers Psyonix are also incredible. They really care about their players and do everything they can to make sure that people are having a great experience. They also charge reasonable prices. No DLC for $40 *Cough* EA *Cough* I thank them for everything they've done and will do for us. I'd definitely recommend this game to friends. I've already gotten one friend hooked on Rocket League and I hope to get a few more on board. Now if you'll excuse me I have a few goals to score. ),Rocket League®

2016-03-31,1,1,400,False,Recommended,A near perfect video game.This game is a rollercoaster ride of emotions. At certain points anger is induced not by the game itself but by my inability to perform at peak perfomance when I know I can do better. Some games I play well I land my aerials and precision shots are spot on. Other games I almost feel like I'm back at square one struggeling to get to grips with even the most basic concepts of the game. I guess this could be applied to any competitive skill based multiplayer game. Just know that no matter how good you get at Rocket League you will still miss the odd slow rolling ball by dodge jumping sideways instead of forward helplessly watching the ball CRAWL into the opposing team's goal along with your dreams.Wow!Wow!What a save!10/10,Rocket League®

Whether you want some action to have fun or just to relax on your chair (or couch) this a an awesome choice. You will spend a huge amount of time on this game playing trading or simply using the soundtrack of the main menu as a background of your other activities. I really like the trading system that they've made because it's different from the one in CS GO. There are hundreds of ways to customize your car and in order to get some of the rare items you don't need to spend even a cent because while playing you will get crates and other items which you can trade for something else with other players. So get this game and have a good time with it. 10/10,Rocket League®

2016-11-24,0,0,1829,False,Recommended,... The ball is everything. Nolifer update I don't think I will ever be able to stop playing this. It has ceased to be a video game. It is a constant. I dream of flying cars and shots with impossibly perfect trajectories. I feel the field beneath my wheels. I pirouette in the air looking for a glimpse into the very fabric of time and space a way to find the unsaveable Quantum Angle. I am finally whole. It's football with rocket cars and none of the BS. Takes a minute to learn and the rest of your life to master. One of the very best games I have ever played. Need proof? Look at how many hours I have spent on it. I don't regret a sincle second of it and the game is just as fun now as it was in the beginning. The community is super active and the developers keep on adding great new things. A truly special experience. Starbase ARC update With this update Rocket League now has an incredible customizable training mode. which is a massive advantage if you want to learn the trickier shots the game has to offer. And trust me they can get really really tricky. But nailing an upside down deflection shot or chasing the ball off the wall and into the goal with a freestyle aerial is an incredible feeling. And now you have all the tools you could possibly need to get there.,Rocket League®

Rage with team of randoms or gather your friends and kick some It is still lot of fun.If you really don't know wait for sale but I assure you it's well worth the money. Hell I'd sacrifice my leg and some non vital organs if I had to.,Rocket League®
