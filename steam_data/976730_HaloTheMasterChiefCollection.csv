32,72471459,english,"While the game collection had a buggy launch history from Halo Reach to Halo 2, you can tell that a lot of love and effort is being put into Halo: Master Chief Collection in the long run (bugs are continually being fixed during and after each flight). Since the release of Halo 3 the collection has had great game launches.
 
343 has been hiring well known Halo modders (famous example: Kornman who created Open Sauce for Halo Custom Edition which made a lot of improvements for single player modding possible and MCC's Halo 1  multiplayer has been updated to have synching AI) to work on this collection and Saber Interactive (the creators of Halo Online) to the Halo: MCC team. Halo 3 ODST has Firefight and dedicated servers for it! The older games (such as Halo 1, Halo 2, and Halo 3) have had content added to them (Halo 3 Multiplayer even has 3 brand new weapons based off of Halo 3 ODST, new items added to forge, some cut weapons & vehicles added to Halo 2 Classic multiplayer according to modders, etc) that weren't at all in the original releases (there are also unlockable skins which can be toggled off in the menu for purists out there). 

You are getting a pretty great deal, 6 critically acclaimed games for the starting price of $40 (for reference, the Gearbox port of Halo Combat Evolved was $20 for a decade, all 6 Campaigns alone are well worth the $40). Halo is known to have great 3rd person driving segments, so you can expect fun diverse game play from this collection that anyone can get into.

UPDATE as of September 22 2020: A custom games browser, Input-based Matchmaking, Regional Server Selection, and Cross-Play between Xbox & PC have been confirmed to be in active devlopment and most/all of them will release together at the same time (should debut with Halo 4).

in regards to unplayable audio quality and crackle.

""44.1khz doesn't fix the problem completely which in my case did not. So I decided to spend one hours in front of a debugger working out what the REAL problem with the audio is. Turns out that it is a very trivial problem to debug.The problem with the audio is that 343i are using callbacks that are taking too long to complete. As a result, the audio engine threads ends up maxing out its allocated CPU resources. When that happens, the callbacks end up stealing precious CPU time from the audio engine and as a consequence, the audio engine can no longer process audio in a timely manner. You can see the results of this poor design with a piece of software called process explorer.The fix is simple. Put the damn callbacks in a separate thread and signal the thread as required. If 343i are competent, they likely already know which callbacks are slowing down the audio engine. This solution would take them not even a day to implement correctly.
Relevant MSDN article:
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/xaudio2/xaudio2-callbacks
How do I know that it is the callbacks that are doing this? The callbacks are partially responsible for the dialogue in the game. When I skipped over the callbacks using a debugger, most of the dialogue vanished as expected along with the heavy CPU resource usage and thus, the bug itself disappeared completely.

54,60414393,english,"Edit: I used to have this review hold my full reviews of each Halo game, but I hit the character limit after trying to include 2's. Therefore, full reviews can be found on the specific DLC's store page. Here I'll talk about MCC in general and include a brief summary of my feelings towards each halo.

Halo Reach: My favorite. It's the first one I played, but damn. The story is great, the gameplay is good, and the multiplayer is great.

Halo CEA: A weak recommendation. It's worth playing if you want to see the first Halo game, but the gameplay is mixed. Some maps are great, some are really not. Some of the bigger maps don't work well due to Halo CE's weapon pool. The only ranged options are Magnum and Sniper, and ammo is scarce for both (notably on later levels like Two Betrayals). Story is a bit weaker, but it has a fun twist out of the left-field. Multiplayer is jank, I don't like personally like it much.

Halo 2A: A very solid Halo title. Story is improved through by splitting the story with a Covenant character, providing more insight. Also makes characters more memorable through one-liners. Gameplay focuses more on CQC, and introduces BR, making it significantly better than CE. No comment on multiplayer.

Halo 3: A very good conclusion to the original trilogy. Story shifts to more dramatic tone. It loses the split nature of 2's story, but it closes everything out pretty well. Plenty of emotional moments that may hit hard if it's your first playthough (and unspoiled, of course). Gameplay takes H2 as a base and expands it, including much more weapons, armor abilities, and some bigger environments. No comment on multiplayer.

Halo 3 ODST: Experiements with Halo's gameplay formula by featuring roaming ""street"" missions in between the ""regular"" missions. The street missions are completely different than anything else in the series. They're semi-open world, take place at night, and are atmospheric and lonely. I love them, and would highly recommend this game based on these missions alone. Gameplay in other regards is similar to Halo 3. Only issue I have is that the tone is inconsistent between the street levels and the regular levels.

MCC itself:
There have been no egregious porting problems that I've encountered; nothing game breaking. Some of the more major problems have (eventually) been fixed. Updates are slow, but they do come. The introduction of challenges and forge makes this game much better now than it was at launch. I would highly recommend this game. One issue is the Co-op latency. In general, when playing co-op, the non-host players will likely have to deal with noticable input delay.",1577135137,1601836638,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198088570237,149,78,17840,640,17840,1601705664

Not too mention Halo 3 has severe issues with hit reg which make it not fun at all. This collection has had nonstop issues and bugs since the start even though they swore they would do it right on pc but that was all lies. In fact campaign should really only be done solo as it has pretty bad latency in online coop. Custom games was fun for a bit but there's still no official game browser to play it online and there's no easy to use file share or workshop to quickly find and download maps and game modes. The time has frankly passed to play halo 1 and 2 online. Since most of these games populations only mattered in the first month or two they were out. Your best bet with those two is to play the original pc ports which can be found online for free. Those are better in almost every way. The original trilogy and odst are still great games but this has not been the best experience for them. Although some other elements of them have not aged as well as others.

[u]Halo:Reach[/u]

-You cannot play co-op on one PC

-There is no forge for Reach? (apparently Halo:Reach's forge will be added to Halo 3's forge)

+It looks great even with its some what old graphics 

-For some very odd reason the mission were you go into space (Long Night of Solace) is about 170% harder than it was on the Xbox 360, covenant fighters will target you like you have a 'Kill me' sign on your back. No idea why but this is just how it is.


[u]Halo:CE[/u]

-You cannot play co-op on one PC

-This isn't the original (Halo:CE) version from the OG xbox, it's the port of the Gear Box version

-The black bars in the cut scenes are broken

+You can set key-binding for each game individually

-The anniversary graphics are to bright.

+All the button combos are still there

-/+This old game wasnt meant to be played with a mouse and key board and as such feels really odd, it does work just fine but something ent right chief


[u]Halo 2[/u]

-You cannot play co-op on one PC

-Why has the opening cut scene been changed? I think this ""new"" intro is from Halo 5 but it wasn't in the original and I don't think it should be here

-The audio for this game is completely beans, whether its in cut scenes or game play its broken af and its really annoying 

-Steam achievements don't really work, I had to redo a couple of levels to get the achievements

-The anniversary graphics are to dark

+All the button combos are still there


[u]Halo 3[/u]

-You cannot play co-op on one PC

+Probably one of if not the best first person shooter ever


[u]Halo 3:ODST[/u]

-You cannot play co-op on one PC

-Some of the firefight stuff is broken but I don't care about that tbh

-/+ I couldn't really find anything wrong with ODST, while its a solid game its also possibly the weakest game story and gameplay wise not including Halo 4 & Halo 5



Apart from that, these games are still great.


If I was to write how much I love halo as a game (also its books, films, anime, lore etc) I'd be here all day, I've easily played Halo:CE more than any game I own on steam (and I've played a ton of H2, H3, H4, ODST, Reach, Halo Wars and the top down shooters)",1591377894,1601775648,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198084014003,111,75,5448.0,745.0,5108,1601932281.0
