2018-12-23,0,0,270,False,Not Recommended,"&lt &lt &lt ABSOLUTE BRUTALITY&gt &gt &gt 7.5/10The best way to describe rust is Adult Minecraft. There's nudity brutal intense combat and long term resource gathering. You can build almost anything from a &amp quot shack"" to holytits off fortresses. So the core of the game is difficult sure but learn some preservation skills and even the bears wont with you too hard.What does you HARD is the community of cod bros reliant on ""jackal tactics"" similar to cod bros found in the pubg playerbase. If they don't dome you from across the map they'll get lucky and walk into your blindspots right AFTER you check them if you do spot them they'll isntantly headshot you with the basic pistol if they miss by statistical miracle they'll hatchet you to death even if they're as naked as you they'll try sneak up and rock your skull from behind (usually and instant kill). In any event social isolation is a tactic much like real life.Even if you manage to get a base up ANYWHERE other players regularly patrol roads and mountains (where the most important resources spawn) armed to the teeth so one has to take care to set up out of anyone's way which is nearly impossible because everyone has shacks ready to go EVERYWHERE.It's sad cause at its core I ing love this game and tried more than most games to GIT GUD at it but simply put if time spent gathering resources &amp guns your at a starting disadvantage from everyone else each new server. This can be said for everything sure but if you're not having fun along the way why even ing bother?",Rust

2018-01-03,0,0,52,False,Not Recommended,This game is not what it used to be. First of all out of all the unoptimized games out there this one takes the cake. Update after update this game is getting more and more unstable and the devs don't seem to realise that they're pushing the Unity Engine (an engine that isn't made for open world games in the first place) to the limits.Second this game is just simply unfinished. The netcode is laughable the devs are adding unnecesarry stuff to the game instead of refining what's already there and it seems that Facepunch rushed this game out of Early Access just to raise the price tag. Unless Facepunch gets their stuff together and actually fixes this game and its declining player base I'd say to not bother buying this game.,Rust

2019-01-20,0,0,31,False,Not Recommended,the WORST game i have ever played in my entire life. i would rather play anything over this game. it has by far the saltiest community out of any game i know. it is close to impossible to get started on any server since every player that has some sort of weapon is a sweaty tryhard running around the map killing anyone they see. the game has terrible optimization running at 60 fps on 1080p low on my 1080 Ti. i wasted almost 24 hours on this game running around the map gathering resources to be killed by someone in full gear and building a stone base to be raided by someone with a rocket launcher,Rust

2016-02-06,0,0,4,True,Not Recommended,Dont even think about buying this game if you running on Linux. Extremely low performance. This should be not listed in Steam as a Linux game,Rust
2017-10-20,0,0,172,True,Not Recommended,Instead of messing with facial hair the following should be done immediately to improve my rating Force client server compatibility. Srsly each server on the server list should be queried by facepunch for the server version. Too old? Don't list it! Allow IP based connections. Hundreds of times I connect and it's failing for some reason. Decrease load time. Srsly I use highly optimised Linux system I have 8 core i7 CPU i have GTX 1080 and still it takes tens of seconds to connect. Sometimes I just want to know if my house is still there why can't it be available in preview or stats? If the whole world is generated on the client and server doesn't need to transmit all terrain data why does it take so long? There is a speed limit in the game why load the WHOLE world in the beginning? Remove regular wipes. They already have a plan to do this only no smart enough developers to do it. Progression is already there but too small there should be a penalty for killing much weaker players e.g. karma penalty. Lots of karma needed for higher tech or maintaining larger number of blueprints whatever. And the incentive for resetting one's life? Higher karma cap. Karma could also improve aim resource finding luck HP or whatever. Just like cash in GTA XP in RPG games skill in CS GO. Solo play. This is a must. I won't be playing with some if I don't want to that's it. If this has to be a multiplayer game provide a trustless multiplayer system. E.g. when I choose my teammates create a bond between us result in karma penalty for team kill or team steal. Add the obvious bonuses of partying like more loot or less hunger. Otherwise I won't play solo and whole game at all. Full technology tree stats etc. This is crazy that I have to open Rust wiki to read item description Rust labs to see how much axe hits the door will take and all that stuff. Making me count manually how much sulfur ore will be converted with 1000 wood idiotic. If it's a minigame make it beneficial for winners. If this is just a mechanism then let me insert wood here ore there and make the burning result orthogonal from the layout of pieces inside. And fix the burned food already. I can pay 1 wood more for cooking if only the whole meat will cook without burning. Make it easier for solo players in the very first phase! It's okay to have wooden doors destroyable by satchel charges available for second day players. But it's ridiculous to have door locks forcing me to stay in house as long as a strong enemy wanders inside because losing a key means losing every item ultimately. When everyone has code locks raiding is gradual if you want more loot you need more C4 but door lock key grants you whole access. This should downscale to 0 day gameplay too! Farming is useless. Killing a bear (if you can find any why? there should be some no build zones with lots of animals hunting grounds) gives me this much meat that I won't care about farming ever. Nobody does. It's still silly that just after the wipe someone can find AK and kill others very easily. Look at the previous points or introduce technology limitation for item usage AK is too complicated to use for a 0 day player. I hate leaving my palace too often. There should be more crafting scrap prices should be 10x less or I should be able to produce it myself. A very low profile highly secure slow way to survive in highly endangered environments. A reactor or whatever. Like in starcraft if your vespene gas resource runs dry it still yields a little amount until you find a better place. Scavenged tools suck. It should either yield 100 with a hit or give 2x sulfur than metal one or more high quality ore. It's totally unworth it's price. It's nice that I can have a quarry but it's so difficult to find the resource I need. And to have a wood plant. I think 15x15 with 2 3 floors should be enough to have a large patio inside with large furnace small forest a few quarries and everything else required to be self sustainable and allow slow progression. It should be extra difficult to raid and could be used to start wars with other lords. Today usually you die once you lose and wait for another wipe. Teleports should be added. Or okay I can have multiple bags so just add the courier service. E.g. a black box I lock it and select who can unlock it courier can't do it. The game estimates the box value (in sulfur?) and the distance based price for shipment. And either the NPC or other player moves it. Being a courier should be profitable enough to encourage players to do it. Losing a box other courier gets the prize. The game should split the island into separate lots. A building right would affect a single lot. Occupying more lots requires more karma etc. When you open a map it should be visible which lots are occupied. Lot sizes should prevent people from building their houses to close to each other. A team could occupy two neighbor lots and merge them into a 2 lot etc. Conquering a lot far away from your base costs you a lot of resources.,Rust

2017-10-03,0,0,762,True,Recommended,Haven't realize how Rust has change me as a person. Ever since the very first day of playing I was hooked like a crack baby. Then like an adult who just blew all his money on crack you hit rock bottom. Thats what I hit after playing Rust for months. Then once you stop something comes back to you. Might be withdrawls or maybe its because its fully immersed video game that makes feel like you are actually there. Having to spend hours on end to get anything done its just something that makes you feel achomlish so much. Even though its just a virtual world. The developers update so much ever since they made the game which makes it like no other. Overall Its a great game and it is unforgivining from the survival to the other players but by playing you will learn alot and most of the time the hard way. Thats okay though because playing Rust gives you an experience like no other. I could write more but I would rather have you play it to get the full affect. Hope you enjoyed Rust as much as I did.,Rust

2019-01-06,0,0,228,False,Recommended,"I've played Rust now for approximately 100 hours in which most of it has been spent complaining to my friends on Discord saying ""I'm sick of doing virtual chores if you need 10k wood go out and get it yourself. I want a gun and a flame thrower"".Finally after several hours my wish was granted. I then proceeded to watch another player from afar create a modest but nice looking solo player base with wooden walls and metal doors. After waiting about an hour for him to do as many virtual chores as possibly I moved in towards his base. I started burning his base down while one of my chore nagging teammates door camped him to protect me. He was ferociously trying to build stone walls inside of his base to protect his tool chest but to no avail. I broke through the wall stole all of his stuff and then burned his TC to the ground.He re spawned and called me about every name in the book and ended it with ""I hope your whole family dies tonight"".Since that encounter I've played almost every night until 2 3AM and I have no problem doing virtual chores with the potential of knowing that I could case so much havoc in a single game that it could make a player want to kill me IRL.

Sure it has some bugs and some things that should get fixed but it is so fun. I would suggest you to buy this game if you have 1 2 other friends with you. Having friends is an important factor at this game. You will probably get bored without friends. Advices Watch some tutorials before you buy the game. Get friends to play with you.,Rust

2019-01-01,0,0,1617,False,Recommended,Have you ever wanted to hate a game enough that you originally buy it to experience the tumor of a community and end up with over 1500 hours and a severe addiction to it? Welcome to Rust an unforgiving toxic enraging survival game that will take you on one hell of an emotional rollercoaster every time you pull up the launcher. Unless you are very knowledgeable on the game don't enter a high pop server and expect to get anywhere especially official servers. This game is fairly straightforward to learn if someone is teaching you yet terrifying to learn on your own. The more hours you have in Rust the more apparent it becomes that there is never a time where you don't have anything to do in a server. Once you learn how the game works you'll end up spending 6 hours on a server and think you were only there for 30 mins. Coming back to the emotional rollercoaster portion of the game you can literally get everything you've ever wanted and more in game just for some naked guy with a waterpipe shotgun to ruin the rest of your day with one buckshot round to the chest. Is Rust Fun? Yes but it can also you off really easily. Should you buy Rust? Only if your friends play it it's on sale or you REALLY want it. Is it addicting? VERY. Unless you have the willpower of Hercules to just drop Rust at any time you'll find it difficult to just put this game down. Overall Game Rating 8/10Community Rating 10/10 or 26/10 depending on your sense of humor.Developer Rating 7/10 Facepunch is very good at patching game breaking bugs quickly (as of recent) but struggle at creating and implementing new content smoothly. This can sometimes make for a negative experience until the problem is patched or adjusted to. SIDE NOTE** If there is one tip I can give to anyone beginning their Rust experience this would be it Never ever trust a soul. Anything that breathes or moves in Rust (and even the stuff that doesn't) has the potential and capability of killing you and most likely won't hesitate to do so.,Rust

The craftable things you learned stay except there is big changes to the component /blueprintsystem then the blueprints will be reseted aswell.Being out of early access doesn't mean the game is finished check out the roadmap and more at https //rust.facepunch.comThe game is still pretty hard and unforgiving. Expect to get destroyed alot. Playing as a lone wolf is hardcore but I am still loving it. If you are playing solo you gotta play smart and sneaky. The easiest way to survive is to team up with other players but be aware that they can backstab you any time so better bring some friends that are trustworthy.,Rust

2014-06-09,0,0,260,True,Not Recommended,"You know before all of this ""New"" rust crap came out this game was amazing. It took no skill whatsoever so you really had lots of competition who can build the tallest structure. I would see some structures that would tear through the sky... higher than the planes would fly. I would see hilarious road blocks and the only way around it was a 20 minute hike. I would see towns. Lots of people would come together to build a large town with hundereds of houses and many trusty people. The modders where actually a lot of fun except the ones that shot you through the walls of your own home they all can burn in hell. I remember at one time this amazing thing happened it made me think that this was the best game ever. At around 3 AM in the morning (Real time) and it was night in the game. Many people were still on the server (Keep in mind it was an official server so there were hundereds of people). I was minding my own business trying to make my house the biggest one on the block. I heard many loud gun shots and they were very very close. I saw the little profile picture icon of the enemy on the bottom left of my screen. His voice would get louder and louder he was right outside my door. I was so scared because I could see how he looked through the little holes of my house and he was wearing green kevlar and I could see an AK in his hand. He would keep knocking on my door so I can open it. I built a little scout room at the top of my house so I can view what was going on. (My house was on the side a very buisy road many people would cross). 5 Minutes later I could hear a very faint noise. I would try to guess what it was and as the other person would come closer I could finally wrap my mind to what the noise was. He was about 10 meters away from my house and he was playing an Ice cream truck song. As he would get closer it would get much louder making me laugh way harder. He played the song for about 2 minutes until the guy in the Kevlar spotted him and shot him. He was just trying to sell ice cream... what a poor man. I couldn't stop laughing to the point I woke my parents up. This doesn't happen anymore. It's so hard to find creative people to do stuff like this anymore. Now peoples' main objective is to raid your house to steal your items. Thanks for the wounderful time you guys gave me. Rust is dead.",Rust

2019-01-06,0,0,167,False,Recommended,The game is hair pulling levels of difficult but can manage to be fun or maybe I'm just bad I dont know. The thrill of fighting over an airdrop or finding people with better loot and completely blasting them with crossbows. The joy of raiding someones base with satchel charges and explosive bullets this game is great for getting thrills over being a little s h it. Even though I said good things about the game it still feels unfinished. I really would love to see the radiation animals come back and maybe make the cargoship event more common and items such as the bleach duct tape paper maps sticks wind turbines etc have a use in game. I have a feeling it would greatly improve the game in a crafting and building sense. If you have 39 dollars and you dont know where to spend it and you own this game buy it for a friend! DOverall I think this game needs work but still is great this game is super enjoyable by anyone that purchases it and begins to PVP. Only thing thats a downside is offical servers getting door camped and getting shot with AK's when you have nothing really isnt that fun.,Rust

It's KOS (Kill On Sight) for all servers. I do like this game but at the same time I dislike it. I cannot even build a 4x4 base without it getting it raided by a$$holes. 99.8% of people in this game are ignorant a holes and it makes a living hell playing this game. I go on for a bit and come stray't back of. It's really hard to rate this game because I dont like disliking games or giving it a low rating because I know the devs work really hard on this.Pros Outstanding building mechinesim. Really good graphics (For a unity game) Really nice gameplay.Cons most of the people are absoloute a$$holes Everyone is Kill On Sight Really hard gameplay (Die very easiley of hunger e.g) And the list goes on for a while....I guess I could rate 5/10 (Overall) 9/10 (Gameplay) 0/10 (Easy) 0/10 (On a good community on every server) I do like this game.

I remember when the game was on its old engine and when they upgraded it. Not to mention the continued support cooperation of both Developers and players in this game has made it a tightly knit community that has its many pros and less cons even as far as changing the entire system of the game's mechanics in order to try and make it more balanced. The game has never been so much more fun and I am officially happy to have given the makers of this game my $20.

2018-02-19,0,0,9,False,Not Recommended,"RUST is an unforgiving experience designed to punish those who are unwilling to learn it's mechanics to the fullest. I made the jump several months ago after loving every playlist from VERTIGO a very popular Twitch and YouTube gaming celebrity. Knowing full well that the journey ahead would be frustrating I took the chance anyways. It didn't take long for me to realize that this game is certainly not for everyone.Your LOVE or HATE for this game solely depends on how much you enjoy hardcore PvP. There is no break from this. Every minute of this game is stressful online or off. The community is saturated with toxic players who thrive on slaughtering new spawns (NAKEDS). Unless you have a group or are some kind of immediate solo play master then you will never witness what the ""BEST OF RUST"" videos has to offer. This is not to say that RUST isn't enjoyable and those who have lovingly devoted hundreds (or thousands) of hours into it have done so for a reason. In the right hands RUST is a dream come true. It's pure chaos and a constant survival of the fittest battle royale of yelling screaming and betrayal. It caters to those who hate catching their breath and embrace death as another opportunity to start fresh and seek revenge. I DON'T RECOMMEND this game if you are like me A devoted but casual gamer that enjoys the idea of foundation. If there was some kind of PvE servers where bases didn't degrade without loot grinds players bonded more for a social experience and teamwork was valued over new player domination I might jump back in. Until then I will not be touching this game for a long time to come.",Rust
2018-03-31,0,0,2299,False,Recommended,Rust is a great game if you like survival games and are looking for a game to put all of you time and effort into. I spent about 2 days straight on a server trying to get enough materials to raid a big clan in which we did. I would say this game is best played as a group because of all the other groups but solo can still be fun. Be sure to have someone teach you how to play the game or look up tutorials because its hard at first but trust me you will be a god in no time. If i had to rate rust i would give it a 10/10 because of all the great times ive had and all of the memories i will have with this game. One thing i dont really like about rust is the tc and bp system i mean there great and all but i thought the point of this was to make zergs less powerfull but they can send out 4 people to get 100k stone easly. Now the BP system idk its great its just i see clans getting lvl 3 on first day and getting aks and Other than that rust is a great game and will always be because facepuch is a ing machine when it comes to developing rust. &lt 3 16/10,Rust
2019-01-15,0,0,282,False,Not Recommended,"I would love to give this game a 9 or 10 because in so many ways it is such an incredible game which can immerse you for weeks and steal your whole life but there are a few small things that absolutely ruin the entire experience as a solo player or even in a team which i hate so much and i personally feel are game breaking/ genuinely ruin the game and make me rage delete it. One of the first things is that you die in about 1 2 seconds 90% of the time. Even when you have gear and good weapons to fight back there is no mercy and most people have aim assist cheats to headshot you and even if they don't it's LITERALLY (no exageration) as easy as 2 quick pistol shots (pew pew) to the body and you are dead and all your stuff gets robbed. This means most of the time you don't have any time to react or fight back you just see somebody one second and are dead the next. Which is absolutely ridiculous IMO. You can sneak around all you want but if someone sees you and wants you dead you are dead instantly. The second thing which they need to fix is Scrap or lack of it. It's probably the most essential farmed resource in the game and most sought after because of what you can do with it like research amazing weapons and stuff for your house in order to survive a map wipe. However you get barely any scrap when farming like none at all and if you recycle loads of metal like items then you get a fair amount of scrap but the recyclers are sought after in busy servers so it's not even worth trying IMO and the places you get pathetic amounts of scrap from are filled with people who (you guessed it) kill you in 1 second and then take all your scrap and all your gear which took you ages to farm. The most recent server i played on (before i deleted the game) i had a success rate of 1 out of 7 scrap runs in which i managed to make it back to my base with scrap and you need like 3 or 4 trips to even build something basic like a workbench level 3. So forget about ALLLLL the other hundreds of things you want to research as well. and remember that you need to replace all your stolen gear and guns every time you die as well so basically you run out fast. The thing that upsets me is you can be really successful with every other type of farming and resource in the game... but farming scrap (the thing you need the most to progress and become epic) is just brutal time consuming detrimental to progress and dangerous. I don't enjoy it AT ALL and genuinely can never progress or research anything or even build anything. I hate it. I hoard loads of amazing items but can never research them to use them. They just sit in my boxes. Yet i can have 60K of pretty much anything else EASY. They need to start giving way more scrap and making it easier to collect in random or quieter places for the players like me who don't want to set up camp in between 3 clan bases or hundreds of salty aggressive nocturnal players. The third thing is for those looking to buy the game is that if you don't have a super good spec computer or laptop then good luck playing any kind of PVP. Even on 'potato' setting I've had my game skip 2 frames and remember what i said earlier about how you die in 1 second??? Yeah well imagine you are turning around and your game lags for like 1 second and pewpew you are dead and theres nothing you can do about it. I even bought a top spec gaming pc and it ran on the highest graphics. The game was amazing and beautiful and never lagged or skipped..... YET I WAS STILL DYING IN 1 SECOND TO 2 PISTOL SHOTS W/O LAG SO THEORETICALLY THERES NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A POTATO PC AND ULTRA GAMING PC BECAUSE YOU F******** DIE INSTANTLY. It's just beyond stupid and unnecessarily brutal/punishing. Alllll that hard work and skill and stealth.... gone in 1 second because the developers ""want to make a real brutal experience"" THAT. If dark souls made you die in 1 second every time you saw a monster NOBODY would play it and it wouldnt be famous. They atleast give you like 2 or 3 hits you get me? Even lasting 5 seconds in this game would be nice. The reason i don't recommend this game is because these things really break the game for me and just don't make me feel rewarded for my hard work. It does the opposite it like laughs at you for spending 8 10 hours a day almost even when you play at night when less people are on so you can get rarer stuff only to not let you progress and research anything youve collected and also to just kill you in a second and have all your stuff stolen no matter what gear weapons gaming specs you have. It punishes you for loving the game and wanting to do better in such a stupid way. If they fixed these issues theres no doubt Rust would be one of the greatest games ever made seriously but I can't recommend such a peice of unfair garbage like this which doesnt reward my hard efforts and playing every single day during a 1 month wipe. The only people who don't want these kinds of rules enforced would be lame salty toxic players who love feeling like big boys because they can aim 2 little shots correctly and kill anyone in a second and take their stuff. It's not cool or impressive. It's super lame. I'm not mad at the individual players. I never shout at them. I'm mad at Rust the game and the developers it's their fault this game can be trash at the best of times and worse of times. Ive listened to hours of podcasts and interviews on youtube from famous rust players and they all agree these things are a joke and thats why they are leaving the game. FIX IT DEVELOPERS. Make the game more enjoyable.",Rust
2018-07-08,0,0,42,False,Not Recommended,I've payed EVE Online for a long time and I thought LowSec was shoot on sight until I played RUST. In RUST as a new player you have two choices 1 install your own server and play alone on it and enjoy the minecraft experience of it or 2 play on a public server and pray all the gods you don't cross another player in the first couple of hours otherwise you'll be shot dead. No hello no warning. Just ... shot for no reason. You only have your starting rock and you'll be shot not for loot.I come in a public server once in a while to check if the community changed and it haven't yet. Fortunatly I got the game while it was inexpensive but never was able to enjoy it fully because of the players on the servers.TO THE DEVS you could learn of EVE on two aspect here. security rating you shoot with no reason you'll loose point. and High security sectors NPC police patrol and they are invincible so if player attack a player with no reason he's killed by the police if you're too low security and you enter you're killed too. People think twice for shooting in HS and people that want PVP and the rush of adrenaline of it ( when ready !!!!! ) go low sec. Allow everyone to play the game thought !,Rust

2017-01-25,0,0,1174,True,Recommended,This game is by far my favorite game ever. Also the game I hate the most.Ill tell you the story of my greatest rust adventure. this was on a vanilla server. My friends and i happened to be hella rich at the time. When the 2 biggest clans on the server decided to raid our 5 man base. so it was around 30 v 5. The base raid lasted for just over 3 hours. There were enough explosions and shots to attract almost all the players on the server. Enough in fact to attract the AI helicopter which roams around the game following shots and shooting and killing geared players. Well the Heli is what ended up saving our asses in the end. It flew in just long enough to distract the raiders for me to repair our base. sadly after they took down the heli one of them (Who happened to be cheating) flew into one of our tool cupboards and got building privledge to blow our base from the top down. Yeah Dont Read All Of That The Game is ing bonkers Ive put 43 days in it i should knowThis game might be one of the most frustrating but its also the most rewarding.Id rebuy this game 10 times over.,Rust

2015-04-25,0,0,257,True,Not Recommended,"When I got this game in early 2014 I thought it would be a great survival. Rust claimed to inherit the best from such giants like DayZ and Minecraft. And it was so until Garry decided to remake the game for Unity.Let me describe the gameplay of an average daily dose. First you discover a fine PvP server (PvE is boring huh?). 40/50 players online. You think it's great more people more fun. WRONG. Even if the map is big enough time to time you naked with a rock wielded will meet people willing to kill you and get that precious rock.Speaking about rocks. Even this starter item has durability and you don't have a chance to say find it anywhere. Also it's the only way for interacting with the surroundings in earlygame. So you have an only one chance to get at least a stone hatchet. balance go for the nearest tree count hits run like about a mile smash stones and pray you'll not get wrecked by some of 24/7 playing people.Fine you managed to get a hatchet. Now you have to build your base. Stop how do you suppose to lock it? Sure you have to craft a lock (codelock preferred). But you'll need a blueprint for it. Fine. For a lock you have to get some metal fragments. How will you get them? From the furnace! How will you get a furnace? You will need to get some rocks and a LOW GRADE FUEL. It is made from animal fat so you'll have to hunt for it. Animals are bugged in Rust so forget about melee weapons. Get a bow and some arrows. Where? Again you'll need recipes for them. But bow is crafted from cloth which is also got from animals. Devil's circle huh? No. At this point you start to hunt for ing BARRELS. Starter recipes and loot are there. In earlygame you're not supposed to get them from Radtown so you have to run like a retard all over the map hunting for barrels. If you're lucky enough you'll get everything needed for a simple twig house in 2 5 hours.Spent a whole day gathering stuff built a fine stone house on a top of a rock not killed by a miracle. You lay down sleeping in your house and thinking of newly obtained safety log out. YOU'RE WRONG. 99% probability next day you'll find yourself laying naked on a shore with a rock in your right hand. Your house is looted and smashed into pieces.Why? F*ck balance that's why. 24/7 players are f*cking killing machines. You'll never get into Radtown they constantly secure it. You'll never get airdrops they're for ones who play in stacks of 5 people all the time. So you'll never get decent recipes clothing and weapons.

We made a nice big base and spent the entire day getting materials weapons tools etc. Days ago we all lived in harmony but it all changed when the fire nation attacked. My friends and I woke up to our new base a completely destroyed home with only 3 foundations.

2018-05-27,0,0,311,False,Not Recommended,So firstly let me say that people can build ladders over your base even if they are building blocked by your tool cubbard and leaves your base constantly vulnerable no matter the defenses you have. Also players can pay for VIP kits which include (Nuking Airstrikes and some other p2w aspects) (these are the modded multiply servers). These 2 points make your hours of hard work sabotaged in the matter of minutes. I took a 6 month break and decided I wanted a basebuilding crafting pvp type game to play and after 1 day on a server nothing has changed as far as these 2 major flaws which ruin it completely.

Its true what I said above I would kinda recommend this game but yea. I've been playing this game since the summer of 2015. And i've ing loved it. This game had the sleep mechanics and everything i've never seen a game EVER like this. It was towards more of a realistic game until the XP system game. While I don't care about the XP system because I play on modded servers but I know the struggles. I've played on a modded vanilla server. It just had tp and sethome. Couldn't find any animals starving kos'd etc. And on modded servers you do the same on vanilla. Just the xp is a lil bit faster like 5x faster if has no difference if you've been on a modded server. And I get KOS'd all the time it's ing annoying. The blueprint system was more towards a realistic mechanic. The XP system isn't. But it's that the XP system benifits you in a way. While you are mining and resourcing and getting wood you are also leveling up meaning you unlock more you want to craft and craft it with the resources to grabbed. I'll write more later GTG. lel,Rust

2016-01-16,0,0,166,True,Recommended,Rust really takes the cake for the open world survival genre! Regardless of the map sizes having their limits they are massive and filled with amazing terrain and resources. Not to mention the diverse terrain still allows for you to build the coolest of bases on them!The game is extremely polished for only being in alpha and shows amazing potential up to this point with very concurrent updates and community featured items in game. For right now the amount of character customization is not available as it randomly generates your appearance but you can just as easily wear some neat gear that makes you stand out apart from other players.The combat in this game is very fun although it might need a little work. It feels extremely rewarding when you successfully take down and enemy or player with nearly any weapon. Whether its a rock bow and arrow rifle or otherwise you can guarantee it will feel awesome when you kick some with it. Another thing to add is that the weapons feel fairly balanced and while gun play is very powerful and dangerous it makes it all that much more rewarding when you have worked hard to earn your gear and weapons.In summery if you are into survival games and don't know where to start by all means pick this game up. You will be sucked into it for days and have quite an adventure.,Rust

The content upgrades are great because the Dev's really care about their game and do weekly content progress news and with the garbage xp system gone now there is a lot more progression it feels like without the time grind. This is starting to feel a lot like the golden legacy days where I spent most of my time. Now you just have fun in the game in a casual way while you build your base through killing animals people and resource gathering (amongst other things). I love this game and after 500 hours in Legacy and now 800 in what it is now I can still recommend this game extremely highly for those looking to have a great time. 11/10 would buy again. Best $20 I ever spent period. Most fun I've had with friends long term since WoW and that's saying a lot. All you need is a group of friends and a good server that you enjoy and you're set. Definitely a game to put on your wishlist if you don't have it already.,Rust

If that was not bad enough 40% of the loading (which are very long as they are on my 7200 rpm hdd) the game goes along the lines of ""Rust.exe has stopped working"".

2013-12-21,0,0,87,True,Recommended,Here are my initial impressions of the game. Its in alpha but seems to be relatively bugfree just content light at the moment.My first hour in the game went like this Spawn get some wood run around looking for stone find one node get killed by player spawn again find one node of stone get killed by player spawn get killed by wolf. I jumped around to a couple other servers having similar results. But finally on the fourth attempt and server I manage to finally find 2 nodes of stone without dying make a stone hatchet but then realize I'm going to die of starvation. I run around looking for wildlife til I'm at zero food and I start losing health. Finally in desperation I run toward a big player built house. 2 people in armor come up to me point guns at me. I use built in voice chat to ask them if I could trade all my metal and sulfur for some food. They give me 10 food which is enough to last for several hours. I thank them and run off. That same player runs into me two more times checking me out to see if I'm trouble and ends up helping me two more times finally giving me a pistol and 9 bullets.By the end of my first 3 hours I finally have a little wood shack a campfire crafting bench a sleeping bag for a respawn point and a storage crate with a decent amount of supplies. So do I recommend this game? I think it highly depends on who you run into in the game whether you enjoy the initial hours or not. Or you could bring a RL friend in with you and then once you finally find each other in the wilderness you'll have a blast assuming you like tense challenging survival games. Either way once you get over that initial painful beginning process (and definitely check out a guide to help with your first hours) you just might have a blast with it.TL DR Extremely hard game that needs more content and some difficulty balancing for the first hours. Bring a friend. And remember that its in alpha right now but has lots of potential IMO,Rust

2014-03-21,0,0,194,True,Recommended,"This game has a great deal of promise. Dayz and Infestion Stories exist to cater to the ""murder and hunt people"" crowd and I'm hoping Rust develops into something more complicated then a murder simulator. The base game is already there allowing people to play and survive the environment which is a significant challenge. But unfortunatly the Dayz a holes are infiltrating the game so time will tell if this game will evolve into what it can become rather than devolve into another Dayz clone..etc.With emphasis and incentives toward cooperation against the environment the game will become what it needs to become.

2017-06-15,0,0,1028,True,Recommended,EARLY ACCESS title (dam gud 1 doe) devs update the game every Thursday while a community update lands on Tuesdays. I don't know that I've played another EA title that was this reliable and promising insofar as whether or not it'll be complete one day. However I'm guessing that this game might be one of those types that update every so often even after release simply to add new features and balance existing systems.I haven't ever played a game quite like this. You're thrown into an extremely large map with only a rock and a torch with which you're to survive. If you're playing on a popular server there are many dozens of other live players crawling the world around you. This game revolves around PVP that's a big portion of the game though that isn't to say there isn't a heap of content to be discovered in other areas of the game. The social aspect of the game is pretty fantastic... I met my first real friend after he bested me in a bow fight. We continue to add cool dudes to our pool of players and the group dynamics are unreal. The ritual for the past week or so has been to hop into Discord after work and browse the server list with them.Everyone has their own roles and specialties despite everyone being plain human beings in game. There are those who aim like robots and shine in firefights (which further branches into shotgunners snipers assault riflemen et.) those who run around a fight healing others/dropping strategic structures and supporting the group as a combat medic/engineer of sorts and then there are those amazing architects who prefer building massively convoluted compounds rife with traps and a variety of turrets.I don't write reviews well but I hope this gives you at least a teeny bit of insight into Facepunch Studios' crown jewel a thoroughly entertaining experience with near unlimited replayability RUST.EDIT The magic of this game disappeared a few updates back. No one I used to play with regularly plays anymore. The game has no direction and this unfortunately leads to questionable updates. Personal opinion.,Rust

If you made a mistake you will strike the wall etc for a very long time to demolish it. Once you are further into the game you can make C4 to just blow it to pieces. I cant because I'm still in the beginning and I'm sure I'm done with this game. How hard can it be to add a demolish function? The random generated maps looks bad and there is no nice scenery to it. You start off almost starving and have to run around trying to find apples or granola bars somewhere. This is located at fixed points but if you move away you need to hunt. Well try to hunt something. This is the hardest thing to do because there is almost nothing to hunt. No 3rd person? Come on this must be beta right? The only thing I like about Rust is the building system. Its really awesome and everything snaps into place without problems but demolishing is a problem. This is not recommended if you are used to better versatile games like ARK. Yes with all ARK's bugs its recommended above Rust.,Rust

A snap of a twig!Outside called two voices one high one low.We wont hurt you! They called. I didnt open the door.Again they called.But i didnt open the door.Once more they called!And this time i opened the door.And behold!

2013-12-28,0,0,194,True,Not Recommended,Edit Everything Server Admin are EVIL! If you kill them they will ban you. That is how you know that they are little kids. Some 8 year old taking their parents money and own a server. They go into invs. and killing everyone until they are happy. Happy trigger and tp to everyone and making them all mad. If you kill them they will ban you right on the spot. I though Rust have a rule about banning? You can't ban someone just by killing an admin or server owner. I did build an army and kill them after that they ban almost everyone that I was with. They did kill us first so payback and I was happy. I care less about getting ban but the server owner should know what they are doing. This is not like Minecraft where you can cheat all the time. Almost (just about every server) they are very bad admin who want everything to themself. They kill you and they laugh. You kill them and they act like a 8 year old (because they are). Well good luck and have fun in the game. Everyone cheat on Rust anyway including Admin.,Rust

Rust does make you angry and i think a lot of people have been willing to give up on the game after their fully honeycomb base fully upgraded got raided. But! you will always come back to this game as it is always fun to start from scratch or to defend your base against 10 russians.If you do buy this game (Which you should) you will need friends to play it with you or make some friends in the game as the odds of your base surviving with you alone are 1 to 1000 not only this but a group of people will be far more sucessful with regards to getting materials ect.What i'm trying to say is yes this game makes you angry but you will always find fun in it in any aspect if that would be from beating naked men to death or from making a huge base you will always end up having fun.,Rust

2016-03-18,0,0,312,True,Not Recommended,Currently more than 2 years after release date the game is still very buggy. When logging into a server even if a server wipe has occured just two or three days prior the maps are all very similar in scenary and also in that they are over run with maxed out players in fortresses and player killers.Don't get me wrong the game is fun to play but very buggy. This is a pure survival game and the worlds are very brutal. It is hard to trust anyone in this game as there are always Player Killers just over the hill from you and coming your way. I don't complain about this because I understand the game is meant to be a realistic survival game as possible so I dig that but trust me 95% of the people you come across will be trying to kill you. The scenary is something to appreciate as well.What I don't understand though and what leads me to believe this game is a scam is that it's been an 'Early Access' game for over 2 years now. When you read the latest and greatest patch notes there are many minute and minor changes where the developers claim to have 'arranged the UI ' or 'tweaked the look of water ' 'enhanced loading times in hills' etc etc.. This game is based upon a 'Downloadable Engine ' hence why there are so many of these games currently out at the moment. And it is up the the developers / programmers to be smart and crafty enough to make an actual game out of it. And sad to say after 2 years I'm not so sure the Rust Devs have it in them...AFTER 2 YEARS this leads me to believe that this game isn't really going anywhere and that the developers themselves are just soaking up what they can for as long as they can. I'm sure I'll be hated for this from the current community of Rust Lovers but I'm not giving this review for them I'm giving this review from my perspective for the people that have yet to buy this game. It can be fun for a couple of days but don't count on this game actually ever leaving it's Early Access stages and becoming a real quality game.,Rust

Sam would make sure that all the children in the north will loose their virginitys before their first birthday and he would make sure that dany will be passed around the north for everyone over the age of 0 to use and enjoy. If he's smart he'll probably make hot pie hand of queen and together they'll crush the whites,Rust

2014-06-25,0,0,47,True,Recommended,This game is a more tactical personal and mental than anything else. Combat and skill does take a big part but gaining somebody's trust then deciding to ally kill intimidate manipulate bargain or backstab someone can be bloodboiling. There is a lot of emotion in this game and it gives off a sense of immediate fear indesisiveness.

It's an emersive 1st person multiplayer shooter style survival game where you have to gather resources build a shelter create tools clothing and weaponry to defend yourself against others.

I'm not a fan of the randomly generated map as it makes the game lose a lot of its character. They have added a hell of a lot of weapons and features but it feels spammed and they forgot about ""quality over quantity"" You also need an SSD to run the game which they should make obvious in the requirements. If you had a HDD drive you can expect to wait 30 40 minutes just to load into a server. This is due to the fact you have to load every single game asset before joining the server rather than the standard practise which is to load assets when the player is within a certain radius of them.I big part of the problem is also the fact that the devs do not know how to optimise the game so on a HDD you will experience a lot of glitching and FPS lag which is the worst in PVP survival games.",Rust

This game will always stay one of my all time favorites but as of now I cannot reccomend this game to you. I somewhat still enjoy playing it. The saddest part is that the dev team is no longer listening to it's players. The dev that basically does everything mentioned above has decided to no longer listen to the game's reddit (which was full of toxic s). This is a good thing and bad thing.

However due to recent updates I regretfully have to leave a negative review. The world used to look beautiful it looks bland now.The twig update and lack of progression and other issues with it not being a true survival game in current state.I do hope the game improves to what it was a year ago and work off of that.I don't often reivew games so sorry ofr poor format ect.,Rust

2018-05-20,0,0,2693,False,Not Recommended,Great game but can be unstable due to frequent updates. I played this game a lot and for a long period of time. Beware though as you could get banned. In my case I was accused of using a third party software to cheat. I have appealed. I do not and did not use a third party software to cheat in this game. What would be the point? To me it would be like cheating at solitaire... it gets you no where. So for this reason of the bogus game ban I am not longer recommending this game. They use Easy Anti Cheat as an anti cheating solution and it gives false positives and results in bogus bans as happened to me.,Rust

2017-01-03,0,0,2681,True,Recommended,"As my hours would tell you this game has a lot of potential. The experience you have depends on the server. If you only play on a server with a player base all you have is that.Of course the community is mostly bad it's a survival game where you benefit from stealing players' Did you expect a post apocalyptic survival game to be all rainbows and kittens?People dont seem to understand that nakeds pose a threat to even geared players. ""WAHH THIS GUY KILLED ME WHEN I SAID I HAVE NOTHING"". You realize that on most servers there's no indication whether or not you have a gun? If someone is close enough to you you can get one shotted and ta da you lost everything.""WAHHH THIS GAME IS SLOW"". Play modded.""WAHHH THERES TOO MANY PEOPLE"". Play on a low pop server""WAAHH THERES SO MUCH GRINDING"". Modded.The performance on this game is pretty though you need a decent rig to be able to get 60 fps. Base building is fun but it's quite complicated. It's all trial and error. Your first however many bases are gonna be complete You're gonna get raided. That's part of the game learn how to manage your losses. There's tons of videos online that can guide you on how to build.Clans. Oh lord. If you're on a big community server and aren't part of a big 20 man clan you're in for a rough time. But once again it heavily depends on the server if you want a more engaging experience play on a lower pop server.Not sure why some people have little hissy fits about skins. It's a microtransaction that in no way affects the core gameplay. You're not forced to buy it. Want to support the devs with a little cash and like what you see buy a skin. Although you can get a few of the cheaper skins for free by just playing.This game isn't for little whining babies hoping to rule the world and have it handed to them although there are servers that cater to that.Overall i love the game. I've had some great experiences with It has its rough edges but the devs seem to be doing a decent job at trying to appeal to every type of player.

2016-07-30,0,0,744,True,Not Recommended,"This game used to be fun you had the choice to do whatever you wanted you could choose to go look for blueprints in order to craft some cool items such as an AK or just farm resources to build a cool house.Now the devs have changed this game so it fits those new players liking in order to sell more games (it's completely okay) but they really don't pay attention to those people who helped building this game by playing it first.before weapons killed people now even a headshot with an AK 47 doesn't kill a ing naked. Basically if you are a skilled player with a good aim but find yourself in a 1vX situation chances are you'll die because you'll need at least 6/7 round to kill a geared player ...Before you could really ""socialize"" with other players even if they had weapons you could knock on someone's door and talk to them without fearing of being headshot by some roofcampers. Now you can spawn and get attacked by some fresh spawner for no reason just ""because it's fun to hear that hitmarker sound"". This is how the community has evolved. Devs have added a lot of PVP related content but nothing really concerning survival although it's a survival game. Animals are bugged they glitch a lot and that's really annoying on the 1st day of the wipe.In conclusion I think the devs focused their hardwork on things that didn't really need to be changed the Blueprint system. Now clans get whatever they want even more easily...I really feel like the game I used to play back in summer 2015 was 10 times better it was more fun more skill based now people just join clan and dominate servers because it's 20+ of them... it's all about run till you get something good enough to fight back aka the bow level 7. yay.Those clans usually starts as soon as the server is wiped and by the end of the first day of the wipe they already have SAR or Thompsons.

This game was designed for PVP. If you really want to learn how to play the game outside of that I suggest you play on PVE servers on your first go NOT ON THE PVP SERVERS. Otherwise you are going to be killed non stop because on PVP this world is all about ransacking and killing others for your own survival. I do own a server (Rusty Panda) that is PVE because I don't like to play just to kill other players for my own survival. Honestly however? This game is beautifully built for HARSH PVP so don't be shocked if you get killed over and over again. If you don't like that it is pretty easy to find a PVE server instead. Go PVE to learn the game then to PVP to test yourself against others. This is a great game although they developers need to do more with optimizing it's graphics so you can play it smoothly with a good middle ground video card. It is designed with NVIDIA cards in mind so it can be pretty hard on any other type of video card.",Rust

Seriously this garbage game is never going to get anywhere if that is their biggest concern. This game has been around for what like 3 years and has been built again from the ground up and this is the kind of that they are focusing on putting in the game? No wonder it's dying so quick. I am officially done with rust for the time being and the only time I would ever consider coming back is if they actually start fixing this steaming puddle of dog that they call a game instead of focusing on gender equality.

You can get in and join servers (via changing the betas in properties to legacy) but you can't do anything you can only stand there. What is worse is the developers of the game since the new version of rust came out the anti cheat has been removed and and hackers have dominated the servers making having fun on Rust Legacy impossible.BUT aside from that the new Rust looks epic I have to admit. Plays very well with minor lag (or none at all) and is quite fun But I don't recommend Rust until Legacy is playable again because to be honest that version was perfect the way it was and didn't need to be completely changed but more updated*If you know a way to get Legacy working again please tell me because i miss legacy so much and i hate to see 15 and my favourite game go to waste*,Rust

2016-08-12,0,0,41,True,Recommended,I actually like this game. No love it. It's the first time I've played a survival type of game like this and I'm hooked. It's addicting as hell. There are negatives to this game in my eyes but first let's start with the positives.PositivesThe game has this original survival build your way up to glory aspect that has finally been done with humans and realistic graphics. It's Minecraft done differently in my opinion. Whether that's better to you is based on what you think. Me? I love it. It's Minecraft done way better. It also has this great atmosphere. You start out hopeless hitting a tree with a rock while butt naked. But once you learn the game and learn how to craft spears tools and clothes you start to like it a lot more. Then you hunt for animals to throw spears at to get food and leather then you gather lots of wood to start building your own home. At first it feels tedious and boring but then it gets a lot better and you get hooked. Soon you'll be living in a stone house with guns and armor. It takes time to build up to this kind of setup and it feels satisfying once you do. It's also way more fun if you bring some friends along with you to survive. The graphics are good aside from the ugly tree leaves and a bit of super muddy textures on some stuff like dumpsters which I assume is because the game is still in development. I've seen stuff about a future graphical overhaul which will be pretty sweet. The audio is also well done especially the death screams. Whew the chills.NegativesNow are there negatives? Of course. No game is perfect. The game is a bit unoptimized. Luckily my EVGA 960 with 4GB VRAM can run this game without sacrificing a lot of visual sexiness. The game still looks pretty good with the settings I have which is great. The animals also have the ability to walk up boulders and mountains and walk through walls which is distracting and frustrating especially when you're chasing an animal with a wooden bow and he gets away by running through a wall that you can't run through. You also can't choose your gender or race. It feels kinda PC but I think it's always been that way. Well times have to change because I hate it. I'm forced to be a black woman. I want to be able to be a hispanic colored man in a game if I want to and I'll proudly say that to a feminist's face.There's also the toxic community I hear about on official servers. They always KOS (kill on sight) with no mercy and stomp on the little guys that are trying to enjoy the game. Clans raid and slaughter everyone. To their credit it is how the game is meant to be played but it's no fun to any newcomers. The best way to avoid these Hitlers is to join empty servers. I always play on modded servers with little to no people on them and I've actually made a few friends on said servers. Now the XP system. My opinion on it is it can work but it's not good right now. On vanilla servers XP takes way too long to get. It's annoying and grindy. I always make sure the modded server has at least 3x or more XP gain to get rid of the grinding. The best way to fix this is to take off new items costing XP to unlock and at least double the XP gain to make it not such a nuisence. There's also the blueprint system I hear people talk about all the time but it honestly doesn't sound good to me.SummaryThis game is great. It's fun and is unique to what I usually play. I got this game in a Humble Bundle for $4.96 and it was 100% worth it. Should you buy? If you're a fan of survival games or even Minecraft YES!TipsHere's some tips I have put together to get the most out of your Rust experience Empty the Parallax Mapping Anisotropic Filtering and the water option bars. I gained 30+ FPS by doing so. Of course if you have a beast PC don't worry about this. Join empty modded servers to get a singleplayer kind of feel. It's dumb the devs haven't added a singleplayer option like Ark and Minecraft have. Look for servers that have a XP multiplier plugin to get rid of the grinding. Servers with a map plugin are also nice although this isn't often. Modded servers with a small playerbase are usually nice and don't KOS immediately. If you want a friendly server those are the best ones to look out for. Don't launch the game in DX12 mode. It's laggy and the water was a solid lime color.,Rust

2016-12-15,0,0,1182,True,Not Recommended,"I have over 1200 hours and don't recommend this game to anyone. Reasons 1) The original Rust used to be a blast (name was changed to Rust Legacy when they stupidly decided to rebuild the game from scratch). The new version of Rust was no where near as fun and has had so many redesigns that you can never quite get used to the game mechanics before they change them again. 2) The community is the very incarnation of toxic behavior in the gaming community.3) The game has been ""early access"" for 3 years. Since they decided to remake the game the progress has been incredibly slow. I can only conclude this is because Garry is either lazy incompetent or just simply doesn't give a about his game after he becoming a multi millionare.4) No Direction / Endgame. Let's face it rust has always been a ""loose"" concept. The idea is to survive and eventualy grow more powerful after you have grinded (gathered) a bunch of and then fight other players but after you have done that then what? Originaly the game had zombies which actualy made the game midely interesting but then in all garrys infinite wisdom he felt that concept was not good enough for his game. But the fact is A concept is better than NO concept! And what happened to the radiation AI animals they replaced zombies??? The new rust doesn't even have them... At least they posed a threat and would chase you in a pack.5) Garry Newman recently made statement asking bored players to ""just stop playing"" which is an insult to early backers of the game like myself and others who have 1k+ hours in the game.6. Lack of general gameplay mechanics that you come to expect in modern survival games. Rust may have been one of the catalyst's for the survival game genre but it has sure fallen behind the curb in recent times. The game still has ZERO vehicles. A legitmate AI threat. Just to mention a few things.7. Broken promises from devs. An example of this is Rideable horses which was promises/hinted at over a year ago but like with many things in rust which the devs ""tease"" in their dev blog it never comes to fruition!8. Unfair focus towards large groups aka ""clans"" and a huge disadvantige against solo players. This never used to be the case in the original Rust aka Legacy. At least in the old rust you would actualy stand a chance to survive on your own but not so anymore...",Rust

2017-02-18,0,0,1831,True,Not Recommended,okay after playing rust for some time i have come to understand a few things about how the game works like for one thing when you play the game only a few things will happen and it gets old real fast like you will build a base then nothing happens and you just get board i think this is because people dont want to build or play or have fun because most people that play rust are little kids who are basicaly brain dead who for real are real life true to the word just little snot nose spoiled brats who have bad mothers that let them play games for growen up's full of nude people but after you get over that if you can you have the problem of hackers taking your hard earned stuff just so they can despawn it and laugh as there mothers ask them if they want a hot pocket or an engery drink or you will get shot in the back when chopping wood or striking a node people love to shoot you in the back in this game or you will randomly die and you stuff will despawn it is a never ending problem in rust every person i use to play with has quit or should i say rage quit rust is about making people rage quit that is what the hacks are all about it is just to make you slaty and rage quit i hate to say this but its not rust that is bad it is the cancer that has taken over rust called stupid people people think rust is call of duty you build a base in rust but no one does that the only thing you can do in rust is be board af or rage quit or make someone else rage quit i have made a guy rage quit just by killing him with a rock and he was in full armor it was luck on my part but the guy got so mad he rage quit no one can make me rage quit rust but it sure is hard to play when every player is basicaly a zombie so in a way rust is more like left for dead because your fellow players are basicaly zombies. and rust is full of hackers if you like hacks or getting hacked then play rust just google rust fly hacks or aim bots in rust and the admins will never try to stop it because most of the admins are and hack them self rust will never fix the hacks everyone on rust has an aim bot and rust is not a good game at all i am an adult so i find it shocking that when i play rust i find a lot of little kids playing rust and it is full of nude people what kind of mom and dad lets there child play a game full of nude people? i am thinking about fliming all the little kids i find then making a youtube video about it . maybe the video i will talk to the kids and ask them about there mom and dads. maybe i will ask the kids if i can talk to there mom and dad? maybe i will ask the kids questions and become there friends so i can find out more about them. find out where they life so i can kick there mom and dads in the head for letting there snot nose spoiled brats play this game???,Rust
2015-07-22,0,0,58,True,Not Recommended,Hello everyone This is my review for Rust.This game has potential. The ideas are pretty good building your own base is statisfying even though not as complex as in other games the paranoia known from games like DayZ is extended to your base and you can have exciting moments with other players.The graphics are fairly good as is the sounddesign.However as you have seen I do not recommend you buying this game. This is due to the fact that it shreds your PC to pieces when it crashes. And oh boy does it crash often. I mean sure it is open beta and all that but please at least make sure that one does not have to freaking reset the computer when the game crashes. Holy cow.So as long as the devs do not fix fundamental programming errors with this game STAY AWAY FROM IT!,Rust

2019-01-14,0,0,2,False,Not Recommended,Some things that should be mentioned that are not on this games store page.1) You do not get to pick your gender or customize your avatar you're automatically assigned race/gender/haircolor and all that. A basic feature even Ark managed to pull off.2) There is no way to put a password on a server to prevent people outside of the group you want on the server. A basic feature most games that allow you to host a private server on so you don't have to play with hackers on public servers. 3) Rife with hackers just check youtube for videos about that. Ser Winter and Max Mears end up facing them alot.4) Wildlife is so scarce the only thing I saw running across the island for 2 hours trying to hunt was a lone chicken. Nearly starved to death multiple times survived on apples found in refuse nodes (barely).5) Everyone in this game is out to stab you in the back regardless of 'noob friendly' and 'no kos' rules on servers. Even your so called 'friends'.,Rust

2016-08-09,1,2,45,True,Not Recommended,I really want to enjoy this game more. It has good graphics and great gameplay. I have two reasons for rating the game down however. Poor censoring system. Even with the censoring systems models are fairly revealing. Censoring as of now only puts small pixelated boxes around what needs to be censored. I do not see why this is the current censoring system as opposed to clothing on the default model. I feel as if the lack of censoring the player model is more of a publicity or sales stunt as (in my opinion) this takes away from the game's survival aspect. Even if they just left the lack of censoring as it is then they should at the very least fix the censor setting from turning off seemingly randomly. The developer's have refused to allow customizable characters. The game forces players to be a certain race and gender. I don't see why even a simple customization option could not be implemented. The xp system is sad. You must level up and then spend experience points on recipes. In a survival game you should have all the recipes unlocked in the first place. In my opinion the success and capability of a player in a survival game should not be dependent on how many hours they have grinded experience for.In the end if you can get past these issues that I have then you will enjoy a nice survival experience. For me however these issues take away from the gameplay and so leave me with no desire to play the game as of now.Here are some sites for reference if you want to read more about the second issue. http //steamed.kotaku.com/rust chooses players race for them things get messy 1693426299 http //www.gamespot.com/articles/your gender in rust is assigned to you and cant be/1100 6438731/,Rust

2017-06-24,0,0,644,True,Not Recommended,Pros Intense Gunplay and Combat. (Although a lot of balancing needs to be done) Long Progression for a multiplayer games. Games can last up to a month. Fun with friends. Absolutetly HUGE potential this game COULD be an absolute mastepiece. Good UI and Good Audio Video Gameplay and Control options.Cons Does not feel like a survival game. The damage model is too low. (Most weapons especially fire arms do too little damage) Bullet Velocity is too low combined with the games movement speeds which allow for bullet dodging. (Not as bad as it was in Rust legacy but its still pretty bad) Progression is too fast. Guns are way too asscessible for large groups of players. I feel it would be more apt that guns be much more rare and muskets should be the main firearms clans uses to fight each other. The Developers delibertly making items useless in the game by either 1) Nerfing them to the Ground.(Heavy Sheet Metal armour is one example) 2) Increasing the crafting cost of that item to a point where that Item is not worth crafting (Wooden Barricade Barbed Barricade are 2 examples) New updates are lack luster and dont fix of any of the games many imbalances or add in substaincial way to the enjoyment of the game. Many Items are near useless and a pain in the to craft.

2014-01-23,0,0,18,True,Recommended,Rust is very enjoyable game at its core but it could be very boring also.The Biggest problem i have is the terrain is more or less same throughout the map.The map is also not that huge and gives you little chance against the trigger happy players.The Game at this stage has severe performance issues also there is no character customisation .Frame rate is also very incosistent even on a high end pc.But If you have couple of friends with you it is great fun.I don't recommend playing this game alone.It is better to team up with someone else.If you can overlook these problems the game is very enjoyable and fun to play.,Rust

There is no point or purpose to the game. Crafting doesn't always work building glitches often packs are lost. The very basics like a working (* % map isn't even implemented. The fact is you are most likely to find yourself on a PVP server where if you manage to not get killed within the first hour your just going to spend your time swapping gear with offline raiders until one of you just give up.Looks nice but the hype just isn't really there.",Rust
2016-07-01,11,5,616,True,Recommended,If your looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place but if your looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place. (Review at the end)Ingredients 1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter2. 1/2 cup white sugar3. 1/2 cup brown sugar4. 1/4 cup water5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon6. 1 pinch salt7. 5 apples peeled cored and sliced8. 1 pastry for double crust pie Directions 1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).2. Combine butter white sugar brown sugar water cinnamon and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil remove from heat and set aside.3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9 inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate pour in apple slices.4. Roll out top crust into a 10 inch circle. Cut into 8 (1 inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips one at a time into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.5. Pour butter sugar mixture over top of pie coating the lattice and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and bake until the crust is golden brown the caramel on the top crust is set and the apple filling is bubbling 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.I actually really like this game and it is my most played game ever. I started playing 6/12/15 or Developer Blog 69.1 (A Minor Update) and I was absolutely clueless on what to do. If you are new I REALLY recommend from staying away from Official or High pop servers until you learn the ropes. You can play solo or with friends each brings a different experience to the game. The community is always fun to deal with It just really depends on the server and area that you are at. They can either be complete savages or some of the nicest people you will come by.

2016-02-05,0,0,18,True,Not Recommended,I was so excited for Rust. It has so much potential and is a great idea but it is not even close to being there yet.First off the serves wipe every update (which is monthly as ive noticed). It is horrible to log on and have everything you own gone and have to start over.Gathering resources can be a grind but that is to be expeted with this style game however you can never truly build up supplies because you are killed or the server wipes.My biggest issue with the game is that you can not play in a private world with friends. I think this would be the perfect game for a group of friends to create there own little world and work for total domination. All servers have to be public which means you can never have a game to yourself and there is ALWAYS some who just goes around a destroys everything you work for.This game will break your heart leave you off and pretty much hating life.,Rust

The mechanics for logging in/out of servers are absolute garbage. When you log out you're permanently sitting there so beaches are littered with dozens of ""sleeping"" players who have logged out.

Not to mention that it does it EVERY TIME YOU LOG even if you already played on the server recently. Game often crashes. And then you have to log in again with the same waiting time. People will kill you on sight. Even if you just spawned. It's disapointing to die every 5 min before you could build anything. And even if you manage to build something out of solid rock some guy will come and wreck it in no time just to steal your 3 lame items. Players are trash talking all the time. Racist homophobic and sexual comments non stop. Building system is bugy and quite bad. Positive points + graphics are decent even good if your computer is a beast.+ research system is interresting.Overall i had an unpleasant experience playing this game.If you like survival with a reasonable amount of PVP i strongly recomend to play 7 days to die instead.

2014-11-24,0,0,2221,True,Recommended,After my 700 long hours of playing this game by my self and with my team. Here's a review for all you that keep messaging me on my friends list If it is a good game.Rust is one of my favorite survivalist game and it beats DayZ The Forest or any other game that you must survive i na big world.Legacy beats Experimental/New Rust by a million. It's the original rust and is always fun and can be really competitive with groups on a pvp server.Unfortenately Legacy is abandoned and the amount of hackers have increased rapidly but lucky there are most servers with great admins who ban hackers quick.(LEGACY) PVP If you have a team on Rust atleast you and someone or you and 2 5 others. And you get stacked and powerful fast you become demolishers. That's if you know how to aim a gun. If your unfortenately by yourself then i wish you good luck if a team sees you in your house and decides to attack you and raid you.(LEGACY) PVE PVP is disabled your all good from going out there and looting and then shot in the back you do not have to worry about that with PvE. The only thing you gotta worry about is getting raided but you do not have to worry about getting killed. I suggest newblies to start out on this type of game mode to get the bases of a protected good house before going to PVP and building some big house with the walls of your house only protecting you. Also good gamemode to learn the world of Rust to know were every road will lead you to and were you are if you spawn in a field.This is a perfect game all about team work and killing as a team. Also having fun solo and surviving.,Rust

If you looking to run in the fields with your friends pick flowers chase butterflies and have a good time... your in for one rude awakening and this is certainly not the game for you. Plus you are looking at starting over a few times due to being raided and possibly betrayed.I grow tired of individuals giving a bad review due to the community being nothing but toxic. Unfortunately they fail to grasp the concept and the nature of this game. Every player on the server (Unless you started off with a large group) have to aggressively gather resources and build themselves up as well as their bases. So do not be suprised when you meet another player and say ""Hi I'm friendly"" and they respond with a bullet to your head. That particular individual has no idea of your intentions thus he will kill you first before you do to protect his items. Do not trust anyone as betrayal is a devastating possibility in the world of Rust and may leave you naked and with a rock once again.Every encounter you face is adrenaline fuelled where you are left shaking after victory and as in pain from clenching so hard. Regardless if you are the attacker or the victim it is experience I have never experienced in any other game before i.e Once I was mining got a pretty decent amount of resources whilst on my journey I discovered a AK 47 with a decent amount of ammo. I did not have the recipe and was really excited to learn it as I needed it badly. Not long after I was discovered by a group of enemies and they chased me throughout the forest. I hid in a bush and about 6 enemies ran past me and I could hear questioning where I went. That was the longest 10min of my life... I was sweating shaking and frozen in fear that I would be discovered and killed thus losing my AK 47 and the chance of learning the recipe. Eventually they left and made it home safely... thats when I realized that I love this game as I have never been so drawn in. Even to this day you feel the adrenaline pump when attacking a player or chasing down a air drop.You start off with nothing other than a rock you soft innocent skin and a torch. Now its up to you to fight for your survival or be utterly decimated on the journey. Be prepared to lose everything you worked so hard for be prepared to be shot at on site as this is a surival of the fittest and once you accept that your gonna have a freakin' blast.I have always enjoyed this game and the best couple of buck I have ever spent.",Rust

2017-03-05,2,1,8184,True,Not Recommended,Rust is one of the worst games to buy. I have 8K hours of play time i would know how bad the game is. the PvP in rust has no skill gap at all anyone can just get on the game and spray ak easy. you also have to spend hours farming for bp's and you cant even get good bp's out the barrels like you could in the old BP System like you get no reward now. solo player would never have a lvl 3 work bench because it takes way to long to farm it and the raiding is aids to before if you were a high hour player could get a base if they knew how the building worked but guess what all the low hour people were saying it is unfair that they could do that. so they took it out the game. now to raid a base you need to farm for like 24 rockets becaues sheet metal now takes 8 rockets to blow. Getting scrap is very hard and not for people in small group's or solo. the game is only for the fat zerg's now. Let's get more on how the PvP is bad though. First the ak before in the old Bp day's the ak took alot of skill to use becaues you just couldnt spray from 100 meter's away you had to tap which means you had to have some what of good aim. Even when you sprayed the old ak it was hard so you had to get good with it but guess what player's in rust didnt want to spend time in a game to get good with it yep you guessed it all the low hour noobs. Now the new ak anyone can spray it and yes that does mean your 80 year old grandma she can hop on this game and kill someone with hours. And the Dev's still dont think that is a problem becaues they havent changed it. To be fair i dont even think the DEV'S even play there own game to see the problems in there game. i dont think not once they have played a wipe and gone through what me and you go through they only care for the roleplay things now. They would rather add a chair in the game then to actually fix the BIG BUGS in there game. One more thing to this game will never be optimized they say they work on it but every week i get the same FPS sometimes even lower so if you dont have a good pc then dont even spend your money on this game it runs like i think thats all i have to say about this game. IF THE DEV'S READ THIS PLZ JUST FIX THE PVP AND MAKE IT TAKE SKILL AGAIN.,Rust

2016-10-07,1,1,1,True,Not Recommended,"This game is for you if you like racial slurs. This game is for you if you like to play with little kids. The object of this game is basically kill as many naked people running around on a beach with a rock as you can. That's it. So if you like this kind of game then jump right in. I'm currently playing Miscreated and I've ran across a couple of pretty cool guys. We decided to play around a bit. You know. Watching each other's back and stuff. Running around and looting and taking on other survivors as we see fit. You know tactuflly. You have to be smart in that game. And it's actually fun. But in this game as soon as you jump in this game people start saying ""i'm going to you up"" (with a rock) because that's all they have. And then if they decide to be nice and pick you back up they'll take your rock so then you have no means to gather anything. But really the only purpose in gathering anything is to basically just hand it over to someone that decides he wants to kill a naked black guy running along a beach. All this wouldn't be so bad if the maps were larger but it seemed like no matter where the game decided to spawn me was around a bunch of other naked people or even people with guns. I have no idea why people that are well fortified in their base with guns and stuff would want to kill a fresh naked black guy running on the beach. I guess their attention deficite disorder got the best of them in school and they had to find a game like rust to occupy their mind while they grow up. They'll probably be doing the same thing when they grow up to be about 40 because they have no attention span to do anything else but kill fresh spawns in this game.And to top it all off one of the rules on the server I was playing was... get this... No griefing. HAHAHI'll get my refund. And I'll go back to playing games for adults.",Rust

2013-12-13,0,0,21,True,Recommended,"Best game ever made. Hands down.In my own words Rust is a brutal survival simulation with a caveman like feel. In the beginning you start off on an ""island"" naked and equipped with a few items and a rock. Players are to gather and collect resources with this rock. As of right now there is a pretty extensive inventory/crafting system Large servers to small servers weapon crafting and modification such as sights lasers and surpressors. You gather wood and rock to craft items for your survival needs such as shelter fire sleeping bags and also the abillity to cook food.The day night cycle in this game is beautiful. What really tops it off are the fires that people make. You can be standing on a cliff and look down and see five or so fires and run and take everybodies stuff! or if you are like most players in this game you will help them out or team up with them.That brings me to my next topic PvP. It really isnt bad in this game. If you run into someone they usually dont kill you unless you bother them or dont respond. There are so many friendly and helpful players out there in the Rust world to guide you along the way. If you want you dont even have to play on a PvP server Servers with no PvP!Teaming up is great and highly recommended in this game because you and your friends can go your seperate ways gather resources and then trade or put them in the storage chests!BUY THIS WHILE ITS STILL CHEAP AND IN ALPHA!!!!",Rust

2016-04-13,1,1,1199,True,Recommended,Rust is a brutal game. There are a lot of negative reviews here but honestly if that person has anything less than 200 hrs play id ignore it. Youll notice its usually a person who has just been raided and lost everything and out of spite or rage has submitted a negative review. Rust simulates a post apocalyptic sandbox world and it is brutal just the like a post apoc world would be. Yes it has powerful roving clans of murderous bandits just like a post apoc world would have. Yes there are lots of brutal young men and teenagers running rampant and murdering and robbing just like youd see in a post apoc world. Yes you have to work hard to survive and it could be taken away from you in an instant guess what just like a post apoc world. People who are moaning about the community being toxic often contradict themselves. They complain that nobody is friendly and they get killed by large organized groups. Groups who are made up of people who are friendly with each other and are working together as a strong community. Clearly if you join a clan or group you will be more likely to prosper just like in real life. Life is a lot harder for a solo player but its not impossible trust me. You just have to play smart and in a different style. You wont even start to understand Rust until youve put around 200 hrs into it. Its tough dog eat dog and friendly people are rare but they are there like glimmering lights of hope in the desolate murderous world that is Rust. Its not about building a big base. Its about first of all surviving through cunning remaining hidden and slowly building your resources. Making the transition from prey to predator and when you die and lose it all take it like a man. As in life your death is coming sooner or later meet it with a smile. The pleasure in this game comes from the journey and the story of your personal fight with an unforgiving world. You will lose it all in the end so thats the first thing you need to accept. If you just want to build something play Space engineers. Very few games have given me a genuine adrenaline rush and got the heart pounding. Rust does that in bucket loads. Its not for the faint hearted.,Rust

No matter where you go in the Rust world no matter what continent you visit you always seem to find the same types of people which is awesme. I am a passive player for the most part so I love it when I find friendly people but most of the time when you just begin on a server you need to witness bloodshed it is just the way it is.The food in Rust is pretty good thanks to the amount of salt players provide other players with. There is lots to do and see in Rust so it is definitely a game I recommend to anyone that likes survival and being able to interact with people online.,Rust

After removing XP system and bringing to live component system game turned into It was really great game but now it totally sucks I'm really dissapointed. Component system is all about luck and running around to find stupid components which let you make a usefull items. No luck no fun. In component system solo players CAN'T make a base hard to raid because they can't find so many gears and farm so much HQM metal to make enough armored doors (sheet metal doors should be named as metal doors because they are uselless when somebody raids you).

I only have an hour clocked in but that is ALL i need to see of this aids riden game. Here is my beef with the game1. AWFUL community. Overrun by trolls 12 yr olds who think they are cool and edgy and s who dont give a Donald Trump's floor tile about helping you. I played for 20 minutes today to see what new stuff they have added into the game. The first 5 of it consisted of loading into the game. After that i spent 12 min with no idea what to do or where to get things.I found nothing new to the game other than slightly increased visuals and ""optimization"" My fault for not knowing the game i know but here comes the kicker. I ask for help in the chat numerous times noone there to help. In fact i get called a "" ing "" for asking. Then after trying to find food I see a person in his house and enter. I then say I have no intention of harming him and am peaceful. The adolesent sounding 13 year old replies with ""What?"" and then kills me with an axe. Everything i got was gone and i had to start over. This is just one of the many incidents that happened in game. Yes. THis toxic troll killing has happened to me before when i wanted to buy the game a year ago. Another incident on the SAME DAY was me getting instakilled by 3 people immediatly after i spawned. Literally like light speed. ONE MORE incident happened a year ago like I mentioned above. I spawned in tried getting resources and saw a small house. I figured that the community was nice (Its not) and tried seeking help. After that I kept getting killed by a iron man with an ak47 instering bullets in my What a fun game.2. Lack of resources anywhere near your spawn makes you frustrated at forst spawn. If you like this sort of hardcore game then this is for you.3. Loading takes a long time and consumes game time. Its not SUPER long but i mean i do not care about the 238 skins a server forces me to download.Only reasons i can think of now. All of my gameplay experiences with this game have not been good at all and its probably why im downvoting and not recommending. Its a bad waste of time combined with a terribad community more toxic than overwatch (my incident didnt seem too bad but just wait. Dismiss my review and buy this toxic barrel.

2014-02-28,1,1,2993,True,Recommended,Let me start by saying that Rust at its core its a flawed RTS game. It gimps Starcraft's Zerg and I hope you like zerglings because thats the only thing you have. You have your only zergling to go against other zerglings and if you dont group up with zerglings then you cant zerg rush other zerglings. Its a never ending cycle of zerg rushing and it doesnt matter how sweet your zergling and zergling brethern are as long as you have less zerglings than the other zerglings. This game only appeals to the Korean market and is a clear ploy to only dupe you out of money. As a RTS on steam this is the closest you can get to the orginal Brood War experience so get it if you have the money.I rate this game a kekekeke outta gg.,Rust

After months of making a game you would think there would be some sort of idea about the future of the game but the only fun part which was killing a zombie they took out and replaced with red animals(animals are great but not red ones that drop items) If you are willing to get a game that is unsure what its going to grow up to be and is only fun until the novelty wears off then buy it now. it could become one of the best games on steam or it could turn into just another game in your collection that doesn't get played. Proceed with caution until it is more developed imo,Rust

2016-02-13,3,1,65,True,Not Recommended,"Like others before me have stated I wanted to love this game. I was enamored at the beauty when first playing Everything about the world was new beautiful and all I had to do was gather enough resources to build my pretty lil' base and to my understanding I would be set. I could set up a sleeping bag log off and (I believed) nothing could go wrong. I could log back in and just go about my daily routine keep to myself and have a base to build on and have fun with.I was terribly mistaken.Perhaps it's my naivety. Maybe I place trust in the wrong individuals. Too much trust in humanity.What ever the reason is RUST is riddled with children who should be playing CoD GTA and the like. This game design is flawed from many aspects. I'll give you a simple example If you let your players spend mind numbingly long hours gathering/collecting resources to build thier base(s) only for some pieceofshit 16 22 year old to destroy it in less than 5 minutes after you log off then what is the point of playing?I have NOTHING to show for it. I spent 8+ hours each day creating something only for some child to knock it down (without stating in global chat/mic) that they were ""raiding"" me. Seriously if these idiots had any shred of intelligence they would understand if you're attacking someone and said someone asks ""why are you attacking me? I am friendly"" you would THINK the attacking player(s) would have the common curtersy to say SOMETHING. ANYTHING. EVEN SOMETHING SIMPLE LIKE ""I'M RAIDING/KILLING YOU BRO"".Alas that is more than often not the case. Do not trust the players in RUST.I don't see a reason to play this game anymore. I've given it enough chances and RUST hasn't held up it's end of the deal. Too many hours and absolutely nothing to show for it besides distain towards the game and it's servers/hosts/game moderators.Sure it's ""Pre Release"" but I see no reason in spending any money towards this game. RUST is simply not worth the price. This game should be free. That would be the only justification in playing such trash. Don't get me started on all the bugs/hacking/gm abuse that's rampant in every server. It's favoritism at it's finest.Save your money and buy yourself a nice bottle of wine and some fancy cheese instead yeah? Yeah.Trust me it's a better waste of your time than RUST.",Rust

2017-12-27,0,0,0,True,Not Recommended,This is the game what i've been excited about to get my hands on but now. I feel dissapointed. You see like any other game this game has it's own point on what to do or what you are suppossed to do. Well i'll start from here. First the game is about ''Building bases'' and ''raiding'' which in my opinion is fun actually and acceptable. But when i got my hands on rust i felt that i was just scammed by Facepunch Inc. and that the point of this game is just to die and then die again again and again. Seriously like i don't have an hour in this game but i feel negative about it already and i don't want to see their related to ''Rust'' products or something. Also poorly optimised graphics are awfull (Only if you can set them but it takes too much place) and ofcourse community. So i'll start from optimization It's awfully optimised just awfully. Now graphics They are nice if you can actually settle them and make them look good but again it takes too much space which will occur your game to lose FPS. And now....The community.... Community itself is very toxic and unfriendly causing me to just refund this game instantly without any positive thoughs. Players are salty never friendly just salty. You can barely even walk to them without getting hit by something. Yeah that's it. I really though that this game is what i'm looking for but it seems that it's not. It has alot of negative crap going on even now. Facepunch can't just goddamn already get this game out of Alpha to atleast early access for straight 4 years i think almost 5. Poor developers poor game and i'm just sad to say this.,Rust
2016-07-27,1,1,2956,True,Recommended,"This game puts you in such a love hate relationship Its grindy and its not a tedious grind but more of a grind where you think ""Ok if i want a big base i have to work for it."" It cant be simplified any more then that. You will have a journey full of pain and suffering with little joy but its the joy that empowers everything else Making you want to play and play until you get raided. The interesting thing is this game puts a hook in your mouth and pulls you straight back in for more pain because its not hard to get back to where you were before a bunch of similair clothed bandits with fully automatic weapons charge into your base which you probably spend days grinding for and take eveything you once owned. With a simplified deep and understanding crafting system to boost up an already addictive shooter with risk pulsing through its vains i do not know how old i will be before i stop playing this game but when i pass i will probably join up with Eazy E because playing solo aint going to work. I recommend it if you have played any of the following MINECRAFT 7 DAYS TO DIE ARK SURVIVAL EVOLVEDNow unless you were hit by some dark magic and did not play any of these well look into RUST and get the real deal.So collect wood gather some stone build a base before it gets dark and dont run around with a torch at night.

2018-01-03,0,0,118,False,Not Recommended,Game play is alright but develiper made it where your account is stuck with a random character ( If your character is a white female your character is always going to be that ) and you can't change it. Then there is the fact that you can't get to far without a team of players to work with. Solo is a no go most the time. I wish I could get my money back.Edit Each update tends to add something that just makes the game harder each time making going solo even more of a no go. The playerbase is made up of toxic people doing toxic things so good luck making friends. As soon as you think you are in a good place to get off the next time you get on which could be early the next day you log on to find that all the long hours of work you put is gone and you are back at the beginging. Plus good servers are hard to find ( at least for me ) and when you do find one they tend to wipe in short time frames so if you join late or even build up the best defence all your work will disappear.DO NOT GET RUST!!!P.S.

Even with an SSD. And especially with an hdd.And once i actually got into the game i get instantly killed by one of the members of this garbage level community after which my game crashes.

2017-05-21,2,4,9,True,Not Recommended,"The single worst designed game I've ever played.Set aside the community for a moment as for any survival game it's bound to be toxic. The game's optimization is a joke and no ""Early Access"" excuse is going to justify that. On a GTX 1050 and FX 6300 setup that can run DOOM at 60 FPS 1080p on high Battlefield 1 at 60 FPS on Medium 1080p this game constantly stutters and runs no higher than 30 FPS on the lowest settings. My setup isn't the best but this game doesn't even look that great. Gameplay's worse. After the needlessly long loading screens the game spawns you in the complete worst places possible this game is what spawned the ""noob beach"" slang and it certainly exemplifies it. The ""Wounded"" system is one of the worst parts of dying bar none 9 times out of 10 you'll be left to die by your assailant and it will take you 1 minute to actually die. In EVERY OTHER survival game I've played once your health is zero you die and that's how it should be. The system just serves to waste your time especially since no ""suicide"" option exists to simply end the torture.The AI is also abysmal. Animals will constantly stop and turn at a 90 degree angle toward another direction. Some like bears totally ignore you even if you're in their line of sight. Traps do not serve any purpose either with the traps doing little to the animals.UI is sluggish combat is sluggish game itself runs at a sluggish framerate. This game is the definition of sluggish.If you'd like to play a survival game that's actually worth your time Minecraft (the game that popularized the damn genre) Unturned and hell even DayZ will give you bang for your buck.

2017-07-15,0,0,1,True,Not Recommended,was OK at first I purchased this after watching it from a youtuber who did a funny series with this game. however I only played about an hour before it became quite boring. players were scarce and too far apart on maps so the game felt more like it was single player and not an actuall game with other players. I would not recomend this game I would suggest buying the game that Facepunch made before. Garrys mod was a much more thrilling game and while not the exact same style of game as Rust is but you will get a great many more experiances out of Garrys mod then you will rust. if you want a game that is like rust but offers a decent gameplay I recomend looking at 7 Days to Die instead.Over all I would rate Rust with a 1/10 due to lack of player interaction and lack of content that users make in comparison to the developers previous game.,Rust

2014-03-16,0,0,13,True,Not Recommended,"You don't want to be around during the summer.The concept of Rust does not hugely differ from the popular game DayZ whereby you are plonked into the world with the bare minimum of survival in this case a rock a couple of medkits and a limited use torch. The idea is that you wander around to collect resources to build up a base of your own or perhaps once you've met some friendly players you build a town together. If you're more inclinded to group up with your buddies and steal the resources from others then in theory that's available for you too. Again much like many games in the 'Early Access' phase there is a wonderful concept that plays out just as messy as DarkRP. For starters I will acknowledge that this game is not complete and will not be for some time but my gripes are not exactly with the games features itself.Aside from the frequently mentioned issue of locked doors where lockpicks do not work and C4 is more costly than my university tuition fees (you can find a review giving the exact requirements.) there are currently many issues effecting the status of this game. To say that either in game or here though would bring about the 'Mob' who will relentlessly shout ""IT'S ALPHA YOU N00B"" in your ear until you're bullied intro agreement. Of course the game is in alpha but it can't take so long to lower the cost of C4 or to increase the cost of guns? While guns in DayZ are also rampant it seems to fair better there as even if you were in someone's face the ArmA engine still renders you slightly helpless as hit registration would sooner you spend your entire magazine to only hear a slight grunt in response this is not the case here as guns are extremely powerful. I don't wish to dwell on these issues though which can be fixed rather I wish to make clear a real issue with this and many others games which cannot be fixed that is the playerbase. Regardless of you attempting to approach a player with a friendly ""Hello!"" looking perhaps to find someone to accompany you to give some help in terms of resources or even just a quick chat are more often than not met with a bullet to your face. ""That's fine!"" you might say ""They're playing the bad guy they're trying to survive too!"". The only thing I can say to that is "" !"" it's one thing to be held up for your goods and sent on your way and another to have spawned in with nothing but your hanging out and a rock in your hands to be killed simply for the sake of it (at regular intervals of 5 10 minutes). The chat is filled with meme spouting edgemasters the likes of which you'll probably find in number amongst any bad part of many online communities such as Facepunch Reddit or . As you watch the chat scroll conversation is often ""who killed me? ur a noob"" ""6v1 noobs"" ""y u heff 2 be mad?"" and ""u mad bro?"". Seemingly then with this type of 'trolling' mentality in mind there is very slim hope of you getting a friendly conversation going let alone a town. While the anecdotes written in the surprisingly short yet somehow helpful reviews might entice you to believe that this behaviour is the source of joy in Rust I would like to provide you with my own. Firstly with me and a friend adventuring around and finding a man running from a mutated wolf we told him to keep running as we would attack the wolf and be his heros. He turned around to us and immediately began to attack resulting in my death and seperation from my friend who I was unlikely to find for some time.Today after around 15 minutes of searching for my friend in this baron map and happening upon him accidentally a man ran to me yet before I could utter a word he shouted ""HOW DOES IT FEEL ?!"" down the mic and shot me in the face. I know some of you honestly find it funny and I can see why. Random acts of violence by a half naked man with a rock are hilarious to think about but after this happening numerous times without reason and you have nothing to your name but the starting items does it not seem tiring? I can give you a comparison from DayZ of being spawn camped or you starting up a shop with no money to your name in DarkRP only to be straight out merked by the local mob. Will it ever change? No. Gameplay improvements such as the rarity of guns or whatever have you are void by the fact that a large number of players will attack you with the rock anyway. Clearly there is some fun to be had as YouTubers such as Frankie demonstrate but I believe their experience to be a rarity and based quite significantly upon their internet fame. Not only is special treatment a given but you also don't have to sit through the resource grind and feel the same investment of time as you actually do playing. The bottom line is that if you can think of a game gamemode or mod you've given up on simply because of the playerbase then this will be your next one. For those of you who still cannot resist a purchase then I will give the advice to go to a small to medium sized server and look around online for some sort of solid community. You'll find more joy that way but have much less encounters (imagine playing Minecraft singleplayer but with just wood and food).",Rust

2014-10-28,0,0,268,False,Not Recommended,"Welcome to the Rust the cyclical model of game development. It works like this So long as they remain in Early Access they can keep making major changes to the game. Each time they release a major patch with a new game mechanic or a graphics overhaul they get a resurgence of players into the game which brings in more $$. So they add something take it away replace it with something else. This way they can say they're still working on the game while pandering to everyone and making money. The Head Developer Himself has said in interviews ""I'll only keep working on Rust so long as it keeps paying my bills. Once it doesn't I'll do something else."" Which is why it's still early access alpha after 5+ years and having raked in more revenue than most major budget titles. And why eventually it will decay into a game that's simply abandoned by the developer in a broken state. A perfect example of this is back when it was Legacy they skipped releasing updates for an entire month because they all became so rich from us customers that they wanted to celebrate Mr. Head Devs birthday by partying on a yacht. This is just an example of the mindset of the people you're giving your money to when you buy this game. Enjoy.",Rust

2016-06-03,1,1,269,True,Not Recommended,Loved the game and put hundreds of hours into it. Random player models were cool and the constant stream of new content kept the game fresh and fun. Eventually I purchased a server specifically so that I could run my own and make a community that myself and like minded players could enjoy with modding tools making the game even more interesting. Things went great and I learned a great deal of admining through trial and error. Everything was awesome but my server simply died because the vast majority of my players were male and suddenly had female models. This was not well received and people became angry when I told them that I could do nothing to change it. The kicker was that the few female players on my server got male models and didn't want them anymore! As of writing this review I have since quit playing rust along with the former players of my server simply because they don't give a choice between being a male or female within the game. I get that they want a player model to stay the same to avoid people misleading other players but why not allow a one time choice of at least character sex so that people can have their individual player model and not create the issues of model switching? I love Facepunch but it seems that the whole system is made to make their jobs easier. Having complete random generation seems a lot easier than putting a little effort into some choice on the players part about their general mode. Not hating on the game and if they ever do give a choice of at least gender I will be back but it feels pretty bad to see a server and community I built over the months to fall apart because of something so simple.,Rust

2019-01-01,1,1,22,False,Not Recommended,Ehh this is one of those games where you'll have to hire people to protect your base if you want to actually get somewhere decent it doesn't even matter cause the server will usually wipe (reset the entire map including your items) and everyone starts from the beginning again.Facepunch decided to give you a random character that you will be stuck with and it will be stapled to your Steam ID. I was lucky and I got a girl with some pretty good body features )If you're really unlucky you could have a black guy. I think theres even different sizes for the d!cks. During one of my first times playing the game I spent my entire time running across the map from a kid who liked my boobies he didn't stop chasing me until he found another poor soul. The only way you will proceed in this game is to be an actual cun.t to everyone you see I once got tricked into picking up a pumpkin. Once I picked it up he started bashing his rock into my face and once again I ran across the map to get away. The thing is I'm not a prick so I don't do these kind of things so I spent most of my time alone away from society so I don't know much about the community other than hold crown for the most toxic player on the server to win.Other than that base building is really enjoyable. I managed to make a house on a dead server 3 stories tall rope to climb to the next floor a roof etc. It was cool but it was a dead server so it didn't matter.Although if you have a LARGE (I'm talking like 5 or more) group of friends this could be a fantastic game I can see how it would work out a bunch of naked men and women carrying rocks sprinting towards you would be terrifying you would no doubt get somewhat far into the game easily since this is a game not to play alone you'll see why in a second.Everytime you disconnect from the server you don't magically disappear you actually 'sleep' (basically your player will just lay on the ground) and all harm can still be dealt to you. This means if you disconnect at 12 00PM and you want to wake up and continue playing at 12 00AM players can still kill you overnight you are left defenceless for 12 hours (unless you make automatic turrets or a good base but you won't get them unless you grind for resources) and you may wake up dead with text explaining who and what killed you.For now and probably forever I have to say no to this game. I'm not a huge fan of the whole hardcore survival thing.,Rust
2015-10-28,2,1,146,True,Recommended,This game is pretty decent. You basically start with absolutely nothing and build up from there.Pros Survival mechanics are perfect. You aren't forced to look for food and water nonstop like in DayZ Just the right amount of NPC threat i.e. the deadly helicopter bears and wolves (although I heard there were zombies and I'd love to see them return) Base building is fun and if you don't chat and make friends with people (turst no one) you have decent chance of actually getting somewhere Daytime lasts longer than night time (I can't stand playing in pitch black settings) Games is optimized quite well (My machine is by far not anywhere near new) Guns are hella fun once you can make them especially when someone thinks they can attack youCons Your body gets left behind when you log off Absolutely zero character customization and this is my biggest complaint. They're calling it a definitive realism feature but it totally isn't and here's why I am a woman if I wanted to be forced to play a male character I could play literally any other game on the market. That's not definitive that's just the way it's always been. The people happy with this feature are the dudes that heavily populate the game so of course they wouldn't complain about being forced into a male character. Besides character customization adds fun to a game and there's a point where realism is just too much realism. Once you've discovered everything (the crafting list is rather small at the moment) and you've got a giant fortified base that's pretty much it which is fine if you're on a populated server but boring as hell if you're own a new/empty server.Overall I would recommend this game but only if you can stomach the total/complete lack of character freedom. The best way way to play is to not care about anything otherwise you'll likely end up hating it. And bashing people's heads in with a rock is quite fun.,Rust

I believe that i may of recieved aids and ebola's love child just from opening it the one good thing abut it is when you firs open it and see how and laggy it is the only option they give you is to quit. Which in my opinion is a great thing that the developers have made. This game is so good that it gave my eyes poonany aids and made me want to worms. I would rather shards of glass then have to sit there playing this ""amazing"" game for 3 minutes with 5 FPS. I love how realistic it is as i can swim within the sand and be soaking wet within it which is just how i live. 10/10 Defo would bang.

2014-02-18,0,0,719,False,Recommended,"Are your children playing this ""game"" that parents are calling a barbaric pedophile simulator? The game released late last year has naked men as old as 60 chase down young boys abuse them and then murder them in the name of fun.Jason 11 years old of Belmont told us of his haunting experience on this controversial game ""I bought the game because I had heard from friends it was fun. I turned it on and the first thing I see is three naked men running towards me! They starting yelling swear words and calling me a 'twelvie' shoved their in my face and then beat me to death with a rock."" This experience has had a lasting impression on Jason ""I sometimes wake up in the middle of the night in a sweat having dreamt being beat to death by old naked men.""We interviewed an older player who wanted to remain anonymous about his techniques on luring young boys. ""I build a house that is a trap and when a twelvie unknowingly comes across it he falls through the roof onto spikes. I then go inside abuse him and shoot him if he isn't already dead from the spikes."" Our repulsed interviewer then asked him ""Don't you know those are children you are abusing?"" He replied ""Who gives a f**k?"" and then laughed. Our interviewer was unable to continue the interview.We asked Double View resident Benjamin Wilburn 68 his opinion on the trend of computer ""games"". ""This is most disgusting thing I have ever heard. When I was a young man I never went around abusing children and then murdering them! Back then we had mates round and had barbecues I said to my wife the other day the computer is a plague with Facebook and Google all contributing to the lack of morals kids these days have.

2016-12-01,0,0,76,True,Recommended,Cool game! Got on a few servers was kos'd on one and another had a monthly wipe (as I later found out they all do) so started my own Oxide server. Game runs well on my AMD 8350 3.5 ghz GTX 680 with 16 GB ram on the 'beautiful' setting. At first the game seems a little silly banging on rocks and trees with a rock. As you progress however the game starts to open up. I've heard/read the community is pretty toxic. The game seems to support clans or big groups of players however thats pretty much any sandbox game nowadays.

So to start this off I'd like to say two things one of them being that I don't know whether to put this as a positive or a negative review and I will come back to that later. Ans the second thing is that I've never been a solo player in this game. I got the game from my friend a few months ago and I started off hating it. But I always had people who would teach me the game and the basics of it. I started off as a total pacifist but a few hundred hours later and I will basically kill anyone on sight. This game makes you doubt everyone (especially mother ing nakeds (fresh spawns). Nothing to lose everything to gain) but that's also what I like about it. I feel like th game more or less teaches you to be cautious with who you trust and if you're gay like that then you could learn a thing or two from this game. Being too nice doesn't get you anywhere. At first I told my friend that I didn't want the game that it didn't seem like my kind of game (as I previously said I'm a pacifist when it comes to everything else) but I've come to love this game so much. And I've also made a lot of friends on it. ) you just need to find the right group of people yafeel? Oh and don't give other people your door codes unless you really really trust them/know where they live and can beat them up. ) Community This is the iest community I've ever been part of and I love it. If you're a toxic who likes to around like me then this is pe fact for you. But if you're somewhat sensitive and can't handle a little ' ' and ' ing ' every other chat message then Id strongly recommend you not to get this game. I love it it's a lot of fun ing people over and I enjoy making enemies because after all it's a game if that's what I find to be fun then that's that p Idk I just thought I'd say these things because I feel like it's very ing true and most people freak out about the community being so toxic. If you don't like it go play ark or maybe even minecraft. Not saying that to be disrespectful or anything but it's the same concept (more or less). Tl dr if you love toxicity and making fun of people get this game. If not the back off to minecraft. DAnd with that said all or you s.

Seems this is quite an issue for some people and not for others. Also seems like they don't give a damn about fixing it either. Using a VPN got the game to work without disconnection but lag was an issue and wouldn't show servers I wanted to actually play on. So still not any good.Will try a wifi connection at some point when I can get hold of an adapter.Update Purchased a cheap wifi adapter. Able to connect to the game and hold connection.

2017-08-28,0,0,136,True,Recommended,Wow... I usually read negative reviews first because I figure they're going to be telling the hard truths. It's evident after my first game session lasting 9 hours that those people either never played a survival game before or they're just not built for this genre and can't handle dying.First off. I still haven't died once in my 9 hours. I'm not an MLG beast or anything. Just use a little common sense and don't build near the massive cluster of other player structures. I found myself a quiet spot that's easily within distance to do some salvage runs. Haven't been messed with yet. I took a shot at someone with my semi auto rifle with suppressor but only got two hits and they ran off.So I've managed to build a full 2 story 3x3 scrap metal base. I have 2 semi auto rifles with basic optic and suppressors. A ton of ammo. I'm getting off to a nice start and I'm loving the not dying yet thing. The reason I keep bringing it up is because I came over from Ark. The game where you get air dive bombed by glitchy cat birds. Eaten by T Rexes. And a bunch of other BS. Not to mention people can't fly in Rust. So no end game nerd will swoop down and grab you and fly up high and drop you.Realistic present day tech guns. Loving that part. No lasers and other sci fi BS like Ark. All in all with only 9 hours played I've already had more fun than like 150+ hours in Ark. Definitely worth $20.,Rust

However on EVERY SERVER the original players will have guns and practically unlimited ammo and as soon as you start to gather supplies (so you can participate in the actual PvP) you will get shot through the tree you're hitting.Yes.Through the tree.Or rock.Or whatever.Doesn't matter because it just ISN'T FUN.,Rust

2017-06-15,0,0,327,True,Not Recommended,Overall a pretty good farming simulator 2003. ON a more serious note the game is fairy well developed but is dying due to changing meta of the current game developement. This game is also very one sided for those who play vanilla. Bigger group more loot to troll all the other players. For those who like to be a lonely solo player this game isn't for you. I just can not recommend this game though due to its inability to adapt to the community and how toxic the playerbase is. Everything is KOS regardless of server it is either kill or be killed. The developers also messed with gun recoil making the game a lot easier on the pvp side of rust.TL DR the game is pretty good but the constant changes to meta and unfair advantage that groups of 10 have against a group of 4 destroyes the PVE aspect and replaces it by soley PVP. (because once you get far enough into a server the PVE becomes a joke and the only worry is a zerg of 10 people with m249's and a massive compound.),Rust

Devs are gods who can never do no wrong and owe nothing at all to all the ppl who gave them money. If you disagree then you simply dont ""understand"" the game or the industrylike they do or dont have their vision or some other pathetic exuse to bully somone whos opinion just happens to differ. This game is screwed which is ok for a alpha but its not going anywhere.The coumunity sucks.The devs have lost interest are rich already and are just blowing smoke now. Its gotten to the point where because of this game if not for games like KSP Planet Explorer Space Engineers and others i wouldnt have any respect for Steams Early Access at all and would never have used it again.I could care less what you fanboys think so spare me the campaign i have played alphas betas and early access before and i know im not alone in the way i feel either.

All raided within 2 hours by 2 guys 1 hacking the other blowing up.So just stay in a small house go out and do what you like to do best in Rust.

2018-06-04,0,0,780,False,Not Recommended,When in the Course of human events it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another and to assume among the powers of the earth the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.We hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights that among these are Life Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. That to secure these rights Governments are instituted among Men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it and to institute new Government laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence indeed will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes and accordingly all experience hath shewn that mankind are more disposed to suffer while evils are sufferable than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism it is their right it is their duty to throw off such Government and to provide new Guards for their future security. Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this let Facts be submitted to a candid world.He has refused his Assent to Laws the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained and when so suspended he has utterly neglected to attend to them.He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual uncomfortable and distant from the depository of their public Records for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.He has refused for a long time after such dissolutions to cause others to be elected whereby the Legislative powers incapable of Annihilation have returned to the People at large for their exercise the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without and convulsions within.He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.He has obstructed the Administration of Justice by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary powers.He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone for the tenure of their offices and the amount and payment of their salaries.He has erected a multitude of New Offices and sent hither swarms of Officers to harrass our people and eat out their substance.He has kept among us in times of peace Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures.He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil power.He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution and unacknowledged by our laws giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation For Quartering large bodies of armed troops among us For protecting them by a mock Trial from punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world For imposing Taxes on us without our Consent For depriving us in many cases of the benefits of Trial by Jury For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offencesFor abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring Province establishing therein an Arbitrary government and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies For taking away our Charters abolishing our most valuable Laws and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments For suspending our own Legislatures and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.He has abdicated Government here by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us.He has plundered our seas ravaged our Coasts burnt our towns and destroyed the lives of our people.He is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to compleat the works of death desolation and tyranny already begun with circumstances of Cruelty &amp perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation.He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren or to fall themselves by their Hands.He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers the merciless Indian Savages whose known rule of warfare is an undistinguished destruction of all ages sexes and conditions.In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A Prince whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.Nor have We been wanting in attentions to our Brittish brethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations which would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. We must therefore acquiesce in the necessity which denounces our Separation and hold them as we hold the rest of mankind Enemies in War in Peace Friends.We therefore the Representatives of the united States of America in General Congress Assembled appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions do in the Name and by Authority of the good People of these Colonies solemnly publish and declare That these United Colonies are and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain is and ought to be totally dissolved and that as Free and Independent States they have full Power to levy War conclude Peace contract Alliances establish Commerce and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do. And for the support of this Declaration with a firm reliance on the protection of divine Providence we mutually pledge to each,Rust

2015-07-10,0,0,262,False,Not Recommended,I am going to leave the negative review for this game because of the removal of legacy. When i played this I felt as if this game had great potential into becoming something good. It was easy to run easy to find loot but difficult to kill players because of you needing to control the recoil which also made the game fun. This game had a good skill gap when it came to weapons.Now i am going to talk about minerals. They were easier to find and helped create a base with friends if you had some who played this game. Crafting with these seemed satisfying and the ores were easy to smelt to make guns. The next thing i would like to talk about legacy is PVP (the main function of the game). Like i said before gunplay is satisfying and skillful(even though the main guns P250 MP5 navy and the M4 were stolen assets from a game called tactical intervention) and killing players is even more satisfying (unless you're playing with a cheater but whatever that happens in every ing FPS/survival game amrite). Now i would like to address Basing in legacy. Basing in legacy was easier because you didn't need to create a padlock to keep your stuff safe from other players all you needed was to put a password on the door so that only you or your friend could access it and it was Satisfying as until someone would blow it down with C4 or satchel charges. You could make areas for your friends or a pve area for a server (ex rustypirates before the server shut down permanently in mid 2015). And now I adress the servers in rust legacy. You could make servers where if you killed a rad bear you could get a ING M4 from it or even a bolt action rifle from it with a ton of 5.56 ammo. I was amazed when i found out about these servers in legacy and made me want to play the game even more. The only con about rust legacy servers in my opinion was the official servers where it was basically Cheaters' paradise. I would address airdrops (I believe they're still the same in expiremental). But for those who haven't played rust or any other survival game with this feature it is basically where a plane flies over the map and a covered up crate drops in a certain location on the map and the chances of getting good gear are likewise. From what i have described I really enjoyed legacy and I REALLY DID and i want to love rust now but i can't since Garry Jewman removed legacy because of a business decision he had with someone else. #BringBackLegacy,Rust

2015-12-22,0,0,526,True,Recommended,UhNot too sure what to write here so heres a recipe for Pancakes insteadIngredients 1 1/2 cups all purpose flour3 tablespoons sugar1 tablespoon baking powder1/4 teaspoon salt1/8 teaspoon freshly ground nutmeg2 large eggs at room temperature1 1/4 cups milk at room temperature1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract3 tablespoons unsalted butter plus more as neededNow to make it1. In a large bowl whisk together the flour sugar baking powder salt and nutmeg.2. In another bowl beat the eggs and then whisk in the milk and vanilla.3. Melt the butter in a large cast iron skillet or griddle over medium heat.4. Whisk the butter into the milk mixture. Add the wet ingredients to the flour mixture and whisk until a thick batter is just formed5. Keeping the skillet at medium heat ladle about 1/4 cup of the batter onto the skillet to make a pancake. Make 1 or 2 more pancakes taking care to keep them evenly spaced apart. Cook until bubbles break the surface of the pancakes and the undersides are golden brown about 2 minutes. Flip with a spatula and cook about 1 minute more on the second side. Serve immediately or transfer to a platter and cover loosely with foil to keep warm. Repeat with the remaining batter adding more butter to the skillet as needed.6. Procedure for adding fruit to pancakes Once the bubbles break the surface of the pancakes scatter the surface with sliced or diced fruit or chocolate chips nuts etc. Flip with a spatula and cook for 1 minute more being careful not to burn toppings.If you have read this far im sorry...

2018-05-04,0,0,1323,False,Not Recommended,I've played more than 1000h so far. The latest update made me think about quiting. Devs don't care about core problems movement (still no inertia no prone objects blocking movement where it seams there is planty place for 2 ppl) shooting and combat (bullet trajectory hitboxes melee distance and more) base deffence (traps are only usefull in online raiding) the building was so simplified that soon players will be allowed to build only cubic bases. The latest update focuses on adding more features which don't improve the game experience. Diving with no ability to shoot crosbow underwater? No one arm firearms shooting while driving boat WHY? This game is promoting zergs on and on. Roleplay zone with scientist inside? No thanks! Once it was a game about survival. Now it's about the roleplaying in corrupted and oversimplified (broken physics) envinroment. Thank you not! This game was fun when it was dark and unpredictable with some things broken. Paradoxicly bugs made the game more attractive. It gave more experienced players an edge. Now when the game goes straight to be CS of survival with bunny jumping zergs I don't see myself any more in this community. It was nice experience for what i'm really thankfull. I liked the pace the game changed. Lastly I fully apreciate the visuals (but believe me you will turn them to minimum because of broken combat to give yourself minimum chance to survive). I will be watching the progress. Maybe someday the game will be fun again to play. But now? Memory leaks server crashes corrupted combat (again!) no physics makes this game as simple as other shooters promoting only kids with wh and aimbots in zergs. Let ppl think make the game harder so players must learn it. Let the people have some fun where are cars? Make the game more smallgroup/ solo player oriented improve base defence let build more complicated bases more deffence oriented. Think about adding timmed servers (3 4 hours a day is too much for any adult to play a day). For now i don't recomend this game to anyone who values his or hers time. The game gives only frustration if you don't want to join the zerg of 12yo kids.,Rust

2017-09-23,0,0,41,True,Not Recommended,"Rust has become more and more watered down over time. The game went from a simple survival game that was fun to play and have a good time even if you were lonely you would still have fun. That was four years ago Rust has become more complex (making it harder to understand) and more boring all together. The first set of changes were nice and were accepting. But over time they just became worse AND worse. The changes turned the whole game into something that has now become a boring abomination. Back then supplies were more likely to spawn back then and there were even zombies too that would add up to the fun. But that has since changed the only thing now that exists is just boring terrain and flatlands as well as snow that look bland and dull. Sure you may find some locations but they have no supplies and tons of radiation. The game has also started to follow up the terrible and unneeded trend of ""skins "" because the hudevelopers want more money in their fatasses. The skins offered on the official store page are the price of candybar which are worthless. The HUD went from a simple black and tolerateable color to a disgusting to look at brown and green. The game has tons of toxic players aging from the usual 12 year olds who think they are cool.The summary of Rust can go like this/TL DR A game that was once good with high expections to now useless changes and bad looks that have ruined this once great game.",Rust
2017-10-09,0,0,121,True,Not Recommended,"Honestly the game is fun for a while ecpecially if you're playing with friends. But it's far from perfect.The combat is very wierd and difficult in a way. I had fun for maybe 50 hours the other hours i've spent is just because my friends still played it. The grind in this game is just really boring and after you've built a base and got all the stuff there's really nothing to do. Because the only way you're going to be able to even build a base is if you play in a relatively low populated server. Which means that once you're done the only thing left is combat and it's very rare to meat anyone in low population servers. If you instead choose a highly populated server you'll never actually get to ""end game"" since all the big hard core clans will get there way before you and then ruin your experince by destroying your baser and killing you over and over again.

""im sorrt"". no prisoners were taken. i have commited a mass murder of 7 nakeds that rushed inside to loot the ruins of a house which got bombarded by the fearsome helicopter with my bow (true story i got screenshots). i was searching the nuclear plant for decent tool blueprints pipe shotgun in hand when i saw that in the nearest 2x2 house a campfire was burning. as i snuck closer i could hear the footsteps of the resident him not knowing the stone wall is all that seperates him from the armed man pesron outside. i snuck around the corner of the square home to find his doorway and blast my way in in the next time he would open it. only wall no door. as i kept circling the base i realised the house had no doors and the guy inside was trapped probably didnt know. since i knew now he would pose no threat to me i approched in a conversation ""hello m8 where is ur door"" ""oh i know i am going to use the remove tool to get out""""you know th eremove only works within 10 minutes of the wall being placed""""oh""i left.later i returned to see if maybe he has found a way out when i saw it purple thick smoke coming out of the roofs. a supply signal. the poor sod locked himself in with one of the rarest items in the game and called an airdrop that he could never get. i took the airdrop and never returned. he might still be there... i teabagged a guy after wounding him with a femur bone until he passed awayanyway incase you are still wondering what this game is here you go its yours. its yours its of the players its of the admins and anything that happens in it is not scripted not planned not perfect. the way othr pepole treat you is dictated by other pepole and if someone acts in one way or another the only punish/reward for it would be the direct consequences of their actions. although the world is yours for the taking remember that taking it is not the only way to go but its still a legitimate way of going.",Rust

You want to go mow your grass really quick? Well when you come back a half hour later everything you did in the last 3 hours will be destroyed.

Can't punch can only pick up some plants. Move to a new server so that I can have a rock. Break rock on another rock no new rocks. Find sleeping person and borrow rock will return it if I can figure things out. Find a log that actually yields wood when I hit it get wood make a mallet. Mallet does not help harvest rocks or wood.

Also if don't constantly play and farm for hours you will just fail at this game. In Rust 99% of the time you play you will not be having fun with a clan or solo. It's all just farming. Community is terrible to. There are things people can simply just not do to not be an but they go out of there way to try to make you kill yourself. if you're naked and you have absolutley nothing you will be killed by clans that can go up to 15 people known as ""zergs"" who have the best guns in the game and raid helpless people because they're bored.

And you aren't the type of person to be discouraged by a few swears here and there with a dash of fresh toxicity sprinkled on the top I rekon you might like this game.You'll run into all sorts of people some nice some not. Some that are that special type of odd and some that will just confuse you. But a lot of your time will likely consist of deing a lot. Don't let that get you down. For if you spend even a moment feeling sorry for yourself another person more resiliant than you will have already moved on to try again and this time they've succeeded. All while you've had your hed in your hands. Rust in an experiance that brings out the best and worst of a person.

2016-11-10,0,0,2007,False,Recommended,"During old BP system 2015 (0 hours) I started out playing with a friend on a official server. Amazed that a game would let you be naked and afraid by default. Figured out which rocks were which then built our shack next to a massive chinese zerg. Thought we ultra epic communicating with them via google translate. They give us a near broken flamethrower and they became our gods. Some other cucklords come by and jump in through our open window. Chinese zerg friends hears our pleas for mercy and opens a massive can of oriental whoop as on them. After that we tried to make friends with a naked and got deeped on.Later in 2015 ( 40 hours) Joined a different server and went around asking to join clans. Found a base with triple high walls and knocked on the gate. Thier leader ""Honda"" adds me to the teamspeak. The next day we build a snow cave base (the legit old caves not the dumb new ones). The whole thing goes to crap when everyone starts freezing to death. Honda abandons the server and me and this other kid are the only ones left. We decide to make a new base in the forest and added to new guys to our clan ""DizazterPiece"" and another guy. Spent the entire wipe sitting in the forest with eokas and the old radsuits calling ourselves the Lorax and killing people as they come to farm trees. Early 2016 probably xp system ( 100 hours) Joined a clan from reddit LFG. Totally disorganized and everyone betrays each other. Built my own base next to the main to keep my stuff safe. Meet a kid called ""Fish"". This absolute madman plays for 3 days straight (72 hours solid) and then logs off and we never see him again. Before he ing dies introduces me to another tryhard called ""blackadder"". Blackadder Fish and I manage to steal everything out of the main clan base before they notice. Got bored and logged off for the wipe.Later in 2016 xp system/old components sytem ( 200 hours) Joined back up with blackadder. Spent a while on a modded 10x learning the pvp and raiding mechanics. Met this kiddo named Vortex who didn't have a microphone. Imagine taking heli and having someone try to type callouts over game chat. Eventually got banned for ""disrespecting the admins"".Even later in 2016 old component system ( 400 hours) Still playing with blackadder but hopping from server to server. Playing mostly solo/duo/trio. We add a third to our group every once in a while. First kid we added had a name that ryhmed with ""penny less jew"". Started to get annoying and came back to different codes. Codeword for insiding somebody and kicking them from the group became ""penny less jew"". Another kid that joined was called ""GamesOver"". Haven't met another person more spastic since and his voice sounded like he was a chain smoking grandmother. Penny less jewed him real quick. He didn't take too kindly and offlined us with some croonies. For some reason the admin gets involved and we trick him into giving us Games' base codes. Good laugh until banned.2017 new component system ( 600 hours) Still playing with blackadder and getting much better at the game. Want to get some higher level gameplay and join a clan called PURE on a big server. ""Microbot"" is the leader but he doesn't last long. Blackadder and I convince most of the clan to abandon the clan. The most important are ""Flovosky"" ""Beedy"" ""Classy"" and ""Darkloki"". Those four plus blackadder and I become NLMB . We stick together for a few wipes and add new people until Flovosky decides to kick Beedy Classy blackadder and I.2018 ( 1000 hours) Beedy Classy blackadder and a few others have an unofficial clan for a few months playing on and off. I play some wipes none of us really going hardcore and just playing for fun. I get some other friends into the game ""kmarinsh"" ""ptR"" and we play some solo/duo/trio's.2018 ( 1300 hours) The group of us decide to make a hardcore tryhard clan zK recruiting people that we know are good players and pvper's like ""CallMeLevi"" and Eventually the clan starts to break up as people get fed up with each other even though we were doing really well.2018 ( 1450 hours) We try one more time to make a clan and bring the old group back together as LMB . We recruit heavily from reddit and bring back old friend to play. Massive zerg and gaining control. The same old arguments then break up the clan again and Beedy and Blackadder leave taking half the clan and the BP's with them. Our base and 2 boxes GP decay a couple days later after the rest of the clan logs for the wipe.10/10 would play againNow in college and have no time to play but it was fun while it lasted boys.",Rust

2017-10-12,0,0,299,True,Recommended,"Review related to the October 2017 update (blueprints 3.0). Current date October 12th 2017.Been playing the game on and off since Legacy.Most of the negative reviews you see that focus on this update don't do the game justice. Earlier updates progressively turned the game into a 24 hour PUBG like focused heavily on PvP with advanced weaponry available immediately after a server wipe.The latest update reintroduced something that had been previously removed from the game progression. A much requested and needed part of the game which is as too many people forgot or didn't know a Survival game and not a Battle Royale.The so called ""grind"" really only is progression. The grind isn't any more intensive than it was before. It just means that you have to actually use the lower tier gear while you progress through the game before you can actually access rocket launchers and stuff (although this isn't all exactly true for big clans who aren't that much affected by the update but that's another topic).To be perfectly honest Rust is in a much better stay than it was the past months. It's not perfect (it never was probably won't ever be) what it needs right now is mainly number tweaking (costs for researching blueprints craft etc.).tl dr Rust is slowly going back to what it originally was. Lots of recent players are showing discontent because they discovered Rust in a different state and they liked it better that way.",Rust

2014-02-16,0,0,0,True,Not Recommended,Don't bother costs a fortune for what is essentially a 10% completed alpha. The game is basically an mmo minecraft survival game with no aim objective or end 'goal'. After half an hour of playing I succeeded in harvesting some wood and a few bits of rock killed a pig which yielded chicken breast (go figure...) and died half a dozen times to a few players that delighted in killing fresh spawns (whilst reading player type regarding 'one shot' cheaters). On each death i spawned back at square one...no materials...no items and having to do the same aimless running around with no map no goal and no objective.This game could be promising....but shame on you Steam for charging 15 for such an underdeveloped game riddled with enough flaws to put any gamer off this game.As stated at the start of this review Do not purchase this game at this stage under any circumstances Do not be tempted or taken in by the nice screenshots and video. The screenshots basically give you a view of the entire game....there are no diverse and wonderful locations to traverse. There are no explorations of caves scenic valleys barren peaks. There is only a grassy plain filled with sparse trees and a few boulders....and multitudes of half finished player built walls and huts that have long since been abandoned.,Rust

Make a stable enviroment. Let me speak plainly as a software engineer. It's not the ""Server"" someone chooses to host from (All be it they do have their own protections) it's the damned software that fights the fight. Servers just use ""software"" to do that and they do their best tighten up your damned code learn how to program a stable enviroment.

2018-06-05,0,0,51,False,Not Recommended,This game. Oh man this game. It has so much potential so much content so much to do. But it's awful. And you know why it's awful?The playerbase. Community. Whatever you want to call it. The asbolute worst I've ever seen. It tops Dead by Daylight and that's really saying something because those people are the worst. You will get killed doing anything. Doesn't matter if you're 2 minutes in or 2 000 years doesn't matter if you're minding your own business or not even playing the game that's right you could get killed playing TF2 or something. Now sure that's a big mechanic of the game but it's taken a bit far when you're killing everyone in sight all the time taunting them with slurs and insults then killing them. Over and over. I have met 2 friendly people in my time playing this game. 2. Literally every single other person has tried to kill me. How are new players supposed to survive this hellish nightmare excuse for a game? Let me tell you a story. I'm playing Rust right? I have a small cottage like base near a supermarket. I have some stuff I want recycled so I open my door and start making my way. The SECOND I open my door some guy rushes in with a machete and kills me. I respawn they kill me again. I survived for like 5 seconds. I have some anger issues so I thought it best to just leave the server. That would be a pretty tame example if they hadn't added me on Steam afterwards. Here's the convo (and despite my bitter hatred for them I'll keep their name a secret)Some heythe bongo man what are you here to taunt me some moreSome u can have your base backthe bongo man you destroyed my just leave me alone manthe bongo man why even bother killing me then man?Some cause I took everythingSome hahahahahthe bongo man if you needed stuff you could've just asked i would've been happy to provideSome thanks for the base br&gt Some ahhahahahahahaSome dumb Some hahahahahaSome Some the bongo man surprisingSome Some ez baseSome trash canthe bongo man great are you done?Some botSome Some is now Offline.Literally five minutes within killing me and me leaving.

I would like to speak with one of the developers in the game about this cuz its not playable that way.I would request (as I spent 20$ on this game) to remove the nudity in the game and make them at least wear a small pants that doesnt have any advantages.lots of people stopped playing this game for this reason and if not everyone accepts that idea make it optional! if some1 wants them with pants then let him adjust it in the settings.same as the ppl who dont want let them watch the nudity of the game no problem but for me.....that nudity is unaccepted and if u dont want to let them at least wear some small pants then I request a refund,Rust

2016-09-02,0,0,1727,True,Recommended,New update made this game beautiful. But for those who get eye strain or headaches easily. Be warn the sun and sky looks as bright if not brighter than the real thing. Play with your pc contrast lower than usual. Other than that this game is amazing and with 760 hours played. I can tell you the grief people talk about is true but they fail to mention the other side of the story. You meet friends and then you meet friendly people who back stab you and kill you the moment your back is turned. Naked players can easily pull out a gun and kill you. That's why soo many naked new players are killed. Not because geared players are being But because they were killed once before by a naked player.Aside from that until you get 50 to 100 hours into the game you really can't understand the quality and enjoyment this game provides. So sit back buckle up and enjoy a robust pvp and pve huddle and bustle. You will die you will get frustrated but you will get use to it and you will have a lot of fun. I PROMISE ),Rust

2016-08-14,0,0,1529,True,Recommended,NOTE FOR ALL THE PEOPLE ING ABOUT THE XP SYSTEM STFU BECAUSE IT IS IN EARLY STAGES AND IN A NEAR FUTURE UPDATE THE BP SYSTEM WILL BE BROUGHT BACK TO SOME EXTENT! Rust is the game that I have waited my entire life for. The complexity and diversity of the mechanincs in this game is unreal as each encounter with the game will always be different in some way! Whether that means you will meet a strange naked man that will attempt to jab you with a sharp wooden spear to harvest your carcass for human flesh or you run into a posse of armed players opening fire on an attack helicopter that is shooting high velocity missles at their monstrous compound the possibilties are endless! Rust brings the meaning of open world sandbox games and raises the bar by stupendous ammounts. With survival being the only goal how far would you be willing to go to continue your venture on this mysterious island? Become a canibal to avoid starvation murder innocent players to steal there resources and supplies or hide inside of your wooden shack for the remainder of your days to avoid contact with any potential danger... It's all down to you! Personally I love rust it's the best game I have ever played but if I was to critisize it in any way I would say that the community is very toxic. 99% of players will try to murder you upon sight so to help the community out help players less fourtunate than yourself by giving them tools to survive and make rust a better place! Also not so much a critisism more of a tip to enhance your experience is to play with a group of players! It always helps when you have someone watching your back!

Or probably the most popular method of sitting on top of your bases and shooting down at people so if you die you won't lose anything cuz they're selfish who can't deal with losing a little bit of stuff to make another players day.

2018-02-11,0,0,2,False,Not Recommended,If you're a good person you're going to hate this game. If you're a mouthbreathing petty waste of space then this game is worth all of your money. You should put all of your savings in a ziploc bag then mail that bag directly to the devs to let them know how much you like their game.It's a terrible experience. You start on a beach dying of both hunger and thirst and surrounded by salt water. I have yet to see a single animal to hunt for food nor a single source of fresh water. I get lucky if I find a couple of mushrooms that stave off starvation for about a minute apiece. Maps are nearly completely resource barren meaning an entire life is usually spent looking for food water and hemp failing and then dying of starvation or thirst before you can make a sleeping bag. I found an old convenience store saw with my own eyes depictions of apples and bananas on the shelves but the game would not let me take nor eat any of them.According to the dev the object of the game is forming alliances with other people. This is the core of Rust's failure. Everyone on every server is starving and naked because nobody wants to help anyone else. We all just run around until we starve die of thirst or get bashed to death by another naked starving person.Unless the server you join has a mouthbreather on it who has wasted enough of its real life to upgrade into firearms. If it does then you'll run around for an hour finally find the resources then be gunned down without a thought nor a word by the mouthbreather. It can smell people who have lives worth living outside the game. It hunts them and rids its toxic sad lonely world of their maturity.The game is a perfect representation of the cancer caused by the confluence of boredom failure and inferiority complex. Don't waste your time on this.,Rust

2016-01-28,0,0,455,True,Recommended,An absolutely spectacular game.Rust is all about starting from nothing and building your way up in a ruthless and corrupted open world. Each and every player is a threat to you and the only way to defeat them and survive is to have a strong house/base where there are defenses and to also advance yourself.What makes it great Even when your base gets completely destroyed by raiders and other human players you want to continue and make things better Practically NO help given to you at the beginning Hunting and killing is funThe only complaint I have is the over powered helicopter which absolutely obliterates you if within a specific radius even then it's fun to hide and avoid it (Or even fight it if you're advanced enough),Rust

If they screw something up in an update they own it and ask the players what they can do to help make it right. In a world (steam) full of infini alpha games with trashdevs (hurtworld dayz standalone ark) Rust stands out as the leader of the pack the example on how a dev should interact with their community.The game itself is brutal there is a ton of work involved and you could lose it all at any moment but if you do well you'll be satisfied in a way that no other game will ever make you.Buy it support a small dev company and support a rad game if you have a problem hit up the subreddit they watch it very closely.,Rust

2014-08-04,0,0,293,True,Recommended,The game ITSELF is fun to play with friends and has many cool features. I would definitely buy it for 20 dollars after playing it for some time. Sadly the Anti Cheat System has many problems though so there are always hackers flying around everywhere even on the OFFICIAL SERVERS. If you are one that is not tolerant with being killed by aimbot every few days dont play this game. The Devs and Garry have been working on a new version of Rust which looks extremely defined and I will definitely play it when it comes out. Its open to everyone and it definitely has potential because of how much work they are putting in to it. Rust at this very moment has many problems so I will give it a 7/10. I will make an updated review when the Experimental version of Rust is complete. http //playrust.com/friday devblog 18/,Rust

2015-06-19,0,0,28,True,Recommended,I think this game is an absoulute amazing game... but there are a few cons that i might have to share. First of there should be animals to ride. Wether its horses wolfs sharks or birds like eagles or hawks! I think this would make the game alot more popular and you guys would earn alot more money selling it. There should also be a single player option and a L.A.N. option to play with friends and ONLY your friends. I would play this game 24 hours a day everyday if that happens... hopefully you guys like this response and like this comment. And to the creators of this game... please please listen to this and create an update including these changes! I love this game so much and would like it to become even better!

2017-03-25,0,0,323,True,Not Recommended,Been watching this game for a while and finally bought it the other day. After 12 hours or so I can say the following 1) Hackers are common. The anti cheat system is flawed to say the least. Spending a few hours building and collecting is super pointless when someone fires through your base to kill you inside. 2) The current maps are far to small for the numbers on the servers. It is very difficult to get your character to the point where you can defend against attackers simply because you are always exposed to players with guns. 3) Its a really fun concept. The whole idea behind rust is really really fun but until the above things are corrected its going to be a very frustrating experience for most people. Love the idea but its still waaaaaaaaaaaay too broken to be paid for IMHO.,Rust

2014-02-26,0,0,43,True,Not Recommended,I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone of any age. This game has a gigantic following complete with constant raids hacking griefing and just flat out total s everywhere. If you're with a huge group your good though and i've seen both sides but they also get old and thats why people turn to being s. The game is centered on survival the resources are spawned mostly in the same area (does this make any sense to you?) if you find several rocks chances are they will spawn near or in the same place same thing with wood. The map is made up of trees grass that lags and a ton of boulders and mountain area. An update comes out all your crap is gone or a server decides to wipe cause of the hacking.Its pointless playing this game right now maybe in 6 years i would recommend but right now its just crap people. Save your money go to taco bell and spend 20 dollars you will get more enjoyment out of it!,Rust

I bought it thinking it was playable only to find out its badly rendered. I spent most of the hour loading a server. Not just one server I went to an empty server and it took such a long time till it finally loaded then I find out you cannot even costumize your character why? I tried playing it but I got really bored right away.I would not recommend this game The one bigaway of this game was the very lazy theme mechanics. These developers are most likely lazy and money driven but I can only guess. Do not buy it.,Rust

2016-05-31,0,0,20,True,Not Recommended,The main reason why im giving this game a thumbs down is because of the player base...I can 't help just thinking of how many times i 've spawned and had some random dude say hi in a friendly manner and then procedes to put a pistol round into my skull...rinse and repeat over and over...and when your actually on a role and have guns and a fortress a clan comes around blows up everything and then spawn traps you in your own base....not to mention the hacking 10 year olds...they make me want to claw my eyes out as they fly threw your walls mowing you down with everything from mines to rocket launchers. and finally when they have had their fun.....they destroy everything you worked so hard to build. The game is cancer in my opinion a haven for friendly people and trolls alike. and when you actually run into friendly people you bang at their door with a rock hoping the 'll let you in and you can be safe from the guy on the hill with a bolt action and a machine gun. Oh...whats that the games point is to raid and kill people...yes the point is to do that but when people backstab you or shoot you on sight over and over its just not fun its repetitive. I haven 't even gotten to my rant about the Bugs I know this is an early access game but if you buy it be prepared to handle damaging and annoying bugs and glitches. I have had fun with this game but I just can 't see it worth all the pain you have to endure along the way. and so ends my rant The End,Rust

2017-05-25,0,0,3,True,Not Recommended,Even though I only have around three hours clocked in Rust it becomes clear only after a couple of hours that the game doesn't have much substance. The game relies heavily on an insane amount of monotonous grinding to pad out play time. Aside from the grinding the only other two things holding the game together is base building &amp interactions with others I enjoyed base building but interacting with others basically comes down to PvP which would be fine if combat wasn't arcadey &amp easy at best its sub par. Aside from all the flaws I listed I really don't see much progress being made in terms of game development the game was released in 2013 and is still in alpha even if you ignore how long its been in alpha each consecutive update appears to be making the game worse. It looks like the devs ran away with all the money and it doesn't help that the item shop came out before the product I paid for.,Rust

The farthest I had ever gotten was into a server but the game didn't respond to any of my commands and ultimately crashed. I have searched high and low near and far for an answer to my issue but to no avail. In fact I discovered that countless other people were experiencing the same problem but this is not just a sudden issue that has popped up. Many people have been experiencing this problem since 2015 two years later and this problem has still not been resolved. To sum up don't waste your money you will be utterly dissapointed.,Rust

If you like to make deals with people and exploit their stupid minds... well this is your game. If you like to blow up peoples bases and murder them and steal their stuff... yeah you get it. There are so many things you can do in this game to entertain yourself that I couldn't possibly list them all.

Should be a ""game"" even with his problems to fix if airdrops removed (or changed a bit)and add more animals in the wilderness with real behaviour (no turbo speed fight back almost all less chicken ofc) the experience of this game is different from where you play and with whom you play (and how many) but the core itself is quite rotten. You have to play almost 24/7 and even with a house impossible to raid you get paranoid of people (for good reason). Raiding is funny even if is a match of whom exploits more but pointless you get weapons of others you lose your weapons from having been raid you get weapons and so on endless. Fall damage is stupid you could raid a house by building a tower and jumping on roof. You should start with pants trousers or whatever... starting over and over naked or dealing with naked ones is little disturbing. If you buy this game you'll lose everything even if zero to a dumb kid playing always taking every airdrop and shooting to naked people at sight or be stabbed with spear while alone cutting wood or just do the evil guy till someone worse (not better worse) kills you on sight.

2017-06-11,0,0,2686,True,Not Recommended,To be honest i realy love this game. It realy is the best game i have ever played. But it just went to .. why did you remove the bp system FacePunch??? Why? Back then when i started i never had any problems with zergs we were only 3 players and we enjoyed the game. It was the most addictive game back then. Farming 1200 BP Frags just to have the chance to get a AK 47 Bp. But then the changes came. They removed the Bp system added the XP system which ment you have to spend more time and actually farm you cant just kill people and take their stuff cause they wouldent have any bps or components on them. And to be honest even that was a better system than the one now. Now the in the BP system the only thing you had to do is get bp frags and learn or uprade and then learn them. In the xp system you had to get to level 7 for a bow... nothing realy more you have to say. Also in the xp system if you had a massive clan you could easily get the ak unlocked in 3 hours just by sharing your ing tools! Now in the Component system basically if your solo or in a smaller group you shouldent even start the game. There is no way for you to get anywhere close to as far as you could when this game still was good. To be honest when i heared that there was a Blueprint server i played around 10 h a day and god mad kills and loot. I had the most fun ever. And when it got took down RIP RUST. In my opinion you should get this game. Developers if your reading this go back to the BP system for a Week and look at how many people start playing the game again. The Component system is the End Of Rust. If you die once. You lose everything.,Rust

Am I naked?15 Minutes in I've found that tab opens the inventory. I'm definitely naked.20 Minutes in I meet someone else with a mic. He proceeds to tell me that I can hit f2 and remove the censor on my junk. I have no idea why I would do this.20 Minutes 1 second My uncensored junk is flapping in the breeze. I feel strangely liberated.22 Minutes in Horribly maimed by a wolf. I survive to be crushed to death with a rock by my fellow man.23 Minutes in Where am I?25 Minutes in Someone in chat has given me the run down on how to build my own house.

Going solo is do able but very difficult. You will NEED to be playing OFTEN otherwise you will lose all of your progress in a flash. This is NOT a casual game. I personally can not afford to put 12 hours a day into a game so I was not able to progress very far. However if you have tons of time &amp friends to play with Rust can be great fun.

Thats what u have to look forward to if u buy this game. No actual content...just the DEVs posting pics and fan art of other people on their main site. BUYER BEWAREAwful so far. Thats my opinion of Rust. The servers are RIDDLED with hackers and they are RELENTLESS. Played my second day and some guy teleported to me and shot and killed me. Thats right he just appeared out of nowhere. It gets better. I then spawned at my sleeping bag which was IN my house behind a closed door and LITERALLY within 2 seconds he appeared and shot me. SO...that means that i cant spawn at my sleeping bag for 4 mins....so i did a random spawn. BOOM...as soon as i hit enter to spawn he appears at a RANDOM location and kills me again. So everyone on the server is screaming at GAMERBRO this kid whos hacking. And it was basically half the server screaming. OH...then on another server we got pvped as soon as we log on....respawnd....and SUPPOSEDLY a DEV was doing a ""fall test"" and made my friend spawn hundreds of feet in the air. And didnt feel like explaining why he would do that to him so randomly. Hackers are ALL YOU will get!!! BE WARNED the name of the game should be called HACK not RUST. SO feel free to waste ANY money on this game cause Hackers and Cheaters are not punished and the supposed IN game anti cheat software is as broken as the game. GOODLUCK",Rust
2017-12-09,0,0,18,True,Not Recommended,I was pretty excited for this game and tried pushing through all the deaths to see why it's so popular. As it stands the player base is toxic (tons of racial slurs and swearing in the chat) and mean. You will get killed and it doesn't matter if you're logged in or not (most of my deaths seem to have happend while I wasn't even online). The only way to avoid this is to survive long enough to get a sort of base going (a heads up you can't delete anything you've built). Also it seems each server will reset monthly to help avoid structure clutter unfortunately that means anything you've worked towards will also get deleted and you start from scratch.As much as I wanted to enjoy this game I just can't. As a result I can't recommend it to anyone unless they enjoy killing/getting killed.,Rust

2014-11-10,0,0,26,True,Recommended,"*First of all i really enjoyed this game for the time i played it*But now the worse part alot of my friends played this game with me and after a while i got a text message from a friend with ""WTF DUDE YOU JUST GOT VAC BANNED?!"" my first reaction was haha stop joking already but when i went checking myself it actually was true. The most part of everything is i didn't even play the game for like 4 5 weeks before the VAC ban.10 days later a friend of me also got a VAC ban and even 2 days after that another friend had a VAC ban.I don't know what this is or how i got this VAC ban but in my opinion it's just stupid as hell something like this can happen to people who are playing legit.About the gameplay? I really like the fact that there are alot of different options and the open world is great the weapons aren't too OP but there actually are alot of cheaters on each server. Building houses takes a little bit long especially when you are on a server with 40+ people playing so you'll probably have to build a house on a spot where u have to walk 15 minutes to get a little bit of resources and afterwards you won't even be able to find your own house.I would defenitly reccomend to try this game if you like survival games and if you are creative building stuff. Don't forget that this is just MY opinion so no hate.",Rust

How could you possibly do worse then rust legacy?? rust legacy forever will be the king to me in these genre of games because of what it ment. 300 of my hours spent in rust legacy before I got burnt out well worth the price tag. 109.5 spent since then testing updates etc. We do not need a korean grindy game theres enough grind out there. What we need is balance and your not even close to release but you still plan to release. I cant recommend this piece of trash the devs are now rushing out the door to work on other projects etc. They had a gem and they have ruined it really sucks. RIP rust RIP. I will change this review when it warrants a worthy review. Until that point the game is in a TBD state because I am not even sure the devs know what they want to do with it.,Rust

2017-11-15,0,0,6007,False,Not Recommended,Rust at the current time is a grief fest where each player you meet will murder you without asking a single question steal your loot to use it or drop it farther away making you work ever so harder to achieve your goal of 'surviving' the many dangers you can encounter. Dangers like bears wolves boars chickens (yeah they will murder you if you let them) and also radiation (lots of it).The game wouldn't be so terrible if not for the griefing players who kill first and never ever stop to ask questions unless they have something to win.Also the game wipes all your progress be it on character or base building so the more you play the better you get at either resisting/fighting/avoiding those griefers but the core of the game if I was not perfectly clear at this point is the griefers.If you like getting griefed killed all day long... this game is for you.Edit I've been told that the problem reside on the shoulders of those creating the hax but I still think that the developers should have tought about this issue before crearing the game. I love the new hot air ballons even tho I can't really enjoy flyinf for more then 60 seconds before I get savagely killed.,Rust

2014-04-21,0,0,214,True,Not Recommended,I really want to give this game a positive review but i cant.I had this game since it first came to Steam since then the devs invested huge sums oftime and money into this game which is good. At first the game used a basic 3D engine now the devs upgraded it to an advanced really high quality 3D engine but they did so before finishing many of the things that game have to offer... with time they added changed many things in the game and now it sure looks good BUT!1. if you dont have any friends to play this game with dont bother you wont enjoy it as you will encounter teams of players that are using TS and just hunt you down and take everything from you which leads me to 2. in this game you have to rush and build a safe house it takes about 3 hours to do so and even then its far from beeing a true safe house but if you are a student or working full time you will have to sucrefice some sleep in order to get this safe house you wont be able to achive anything in 1 or 2 hours and 3 is if you are lucky and play on servers with low population.3. after 3 hours if you are lucky you will have a small stone shack stone is ok to defend against thives but it wont help you against true raiders and there are planty of them... so you spend time and sweat and build your safe house you then go to sleep just so that in the morning you will find your safehouse raided and you are dead 3 hours went to thin air well done now start over from scratch!This game is designed to be played by teenagers that finish school at 2 and spend the rest of the day and far into the night playing Rust (you will also notice it by the chat flooded by all those pizzaface spammers that just swear and abuse) so unless you have the patience for teenagers and their spam about virginity and sex with your mother and if you have the time buy it. in any other case AVOID IT!,Rust

You are a naked guy who has no clue how he got in the place he will be and start bashing people for about 4 hours dying a couple of 50 times till you bash someones head and get a gun. You will get wood buyld a house and be proud of your acomplishments. You will leave the game. The next time you open it you find your house raided and you rage quit. But you will play again with hope that you will become something. You find a couple of newbies and team up with tham. Thay turn out to be good friends you play about 10 days building and strugling for a goal to be the best. After 10 days thay all quit rust and you are left alone again. You get raided you rage quit.

And that's why Im going to be harsh.This is a really fun game to play alone or with a friend but sadly it has a little player base this is based on 2 Facts N 1 its worth 20 USD it's insane like this game should be free the devs really needs to hurry the realease of its free stage when we had the free week there was almost six more times player than now its a cry for help and the Devs don give a F++k N 2 the other fact its that Rust like Arena its a game with not so easy mechanics so is really easy for someone to get frustrated there is a big curve of kwowlegde in the game. If you really want to enjoy the game you are going to have to learn every character ability and item in the game and then maybe then you could have fun like i do but its going to take you time.Apart from those things this game really deserves a chance it's a different take from the Battle Royale Genre. It has so much potencial the game is well design and has a beautiful aesthetic. With all this information I think the game in his current state it's a 6/10I Hope this game gets to a healty place for now i going to keep playing it cause after all its a fun like hell,Rust

Rust has many guns and many ways to customize them. You level up to unlock them and you can also go into rad towns to find them.

2017-06-22,0,0,1871,True,Not Recommended,"BEFORE READING THIS I HAVE 2 ACCOUNTS ON RUST. ONE WAS VACED CAUSE OF A DUMB REASON WASN'T HACKINGThey want a positive review when they keep ing up the game. Me and my whole clan of 30 quit this game cause they are making it nothing. Ruining it. Mostly Helk get that sack of the outta there Bring Garry Newman back. He made the game for what it was. REALLY REALLY good. THERE WAS NO PROBLEMS. ITs funny tho cause did the devs really not notice the second helk started ruining the game that Garry made was when people started talking bad about the game. You want reviews when people aren't mad. If you want that... MAYBE STOP PEOPLE OFF BY MAKING THE TTTT. Ive been playing the game since it came out back in like 2014 with my friends legecy was fun then the new one came out and it was new something we didn't expect and it was FUN Original XP and BluePrint system were VERY GOOD old PVP old Farming. THEY WERE FINE. This t where they ""bring back the blueprint system"".... they are ing THEY KEPT THE COMPONENTS THE MAIN REASON WHY NO ONE LIKED THE GAME BEFORE IS BECAUSE OF COMPONENTS NOW YOU MADE IT SO NOT ONLY WE HAVE TO FIND THE ING BLUEPRINTS BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO FIND THE COMPONENTS. Fix the game and maybe people will stop getting mad untill then stop ing asking for us to like the game head Helk is creating. Personally you want better reviews? Stop on the cars. Its not DayZ or any other game while it will add something new and maybe be fun to mess with If you want to add new to the game that is big like that make a experimental version where people can go try it to see if they like it and give there intake majorty rules. But that is all. If you want people to stop being mad and writing bad reviews stop making them mad Revert back to the original XP system or Blue Print. Thank you to Dumb Studios.

2017-12-12,0,0,25,True,Not Recommended,"Whatever videos show you is a lie.This game is full of people who will kill you for no reason right after you spawn in while they scream autisticly. You'll exit a server after building a base and the next day you'll be welcomed to a screen saying ""You were killed by *whatever"" and be forced to start all over again. The only way to progress is if you're in a group of three or more and even then you'll still get raided and killed. This game is full of people who screen racial sexual and overall obscene insults and writing them on in game signs and chats. Regardless of the game's ""not for the sensitive"" reputation the overwhelming ammount of people who depict the worst of the online world is sickening and evident that this game is what preteens turn to after Minecraft becomes boring they just want Minecraft with murder.As for gameplay I'm not as versed in describing. You hit trees with rocks to get wood boulders to get stone and animals (3 out of 4 of which will kill you) for fat and meat. Building is overly simple while being fusrating seeing as it will sometimes let you build things into walls and other times not. And combat is almost entirely luck based you won't know if an arrow or bullet hits until it plays a small sound and melee fighting is atrocius seeing as you never know how much health the other person has. Armor is only effective if you wear a helmet. Resources are random and scarce so you're lucky to find something as basic as stone. The blueprint system seems pointless. Air drops are nine times out of ten gotten by people who are already fully geared. Aformentioned geared guys will also travel the entire map killing naked people who only have the starting tools.I despise this game though far be it from me to discourage you from this breeding ground of toxicity and hatred if you enjoy it then so be it.",Rust

My first experience was playing with friends in a small collection of shacks once that got raided we decided to build a solid base far from the towns and learn how to play. At the moment the endgame (which is in my opinion making explosives and raiding bases) is the most enjoyable and rewarding part of this game. However the UI is clunky there are countless glitches such as flying animals and walking through walls but in the case of a game with this much promise it's a privilege to be a part of the development process. I like many other people have high hopes for this little gem.,Rust

There is no Roleplay servers or ""no kos"" Rust is very violent and as a new player you should expect nothing but the worse possible treatment from other players. I would highly suggest watching a few videos on how to play before joing a server or you will most likley quit after 10 minutes. That being said rust is still a very fun game that combines pvp with survival. The base building is the best ive seen in any early access survival game and has a lot of room for creativity and fun. The permadeath system is great so that if you kill another player you get EVERYTHING they have on them. The game is very polished and is soon coming out of early access. I would highly recomend this game to anybody who wants to play a fun survival game with their friends.",Rust

2015-03-19,0,0,69,True,Not Recommended,"When Rust was first released I had many fun adventures with a group we called the Bay. The Bay was located near the hangar and it consisted of about a dozen houses for about 19 people. I was one of them. Had a blast battling a group known as the Radtown Flats led by a man named Simison. Our leader Wolf declared war after a sniper attack by the Radtown Flats resulted in 3 of us dead. So we set up an ambush. Me and my partner waited in the rocks with submachine guns waiting for Simison and his cronies to attack the Bay. When Wolf announced that the Bay was being fired upon Alice and I leaped over the rock lined up our sights on Simison's back and pulled the trigger. Killing the bandit lord was my all time favorite Rust moment. Sadly those stories have all but died off. The ""new"" Rust is just crap.

2016-07-17,0,0,1,True,Not Recommended,It's a pay to win game and I can't get on one server without getting spawn killed it's ing . And it doesn't show you how to actually play and if you look up the basics they're from like a year ago and it's changed. It's also horribly optimized a gtx 980 as the recommended!?!? that's $400 for just the graphics card alone I don't have that kind of money. I know it's early access but there's no fun to be had here unless you're a player that's been playing this ever since the servers first started. And I cant even find food in game no matter how hard I look I cant find any food at all. And you can barely tell the difference between what rocks are minable and what ones are not. I do NOT recommend getting this game if you're new to it. Hell I'm not new to the survival genre and it's difficult.,Rust

2019-01-11,0,0,8,False,Not Recommended,3/10 and Beouce it have alot of annoying crappy archaic and unfinished things.If you like any survival games you can add extra 3 points but if you like only good survival games then you can add only 1 point so final will be 4/10. No 5 just 4.I'm just tried and I'll not write all bad unfinished or unbalanced things. Wrote only few of them.This game is already closer to the trash then to perfect game. Since 0/10 would be a trash. Logic dear patological hater fashioners. Everything needs to be rebalanced food straving farming building shoting fighting damage fall damage equips clothes freezing... Game on high settings doesn't looks like top10 and it requires ALOT of resources. But launched at potoato (lowest) settings make the game looks like a 1990 game but it still requires ALOT of resources. So graphics compared to the requiments are low to very low. Character creation only with tweaks like launch commands (changing sex skin color etc). Lots of nudity everywhere. Naked character is naked. No underwear. This game have medium movement system. Shift to run should be repaced with shift to walk. 3 sec shift button hold is still a poor idea. No options to toggle it out or reconfigure. Your little finger gonna hurt until you get ultra muscles on it. It's so archaic like in crappy 1990 2000 FPS games. Practicly you cannot rebuild your house game isn't for players who are love building. Unless you find a mods what allows to easly destroy own walls. Shoting system reminds me games from before 2000 year. Noone plays them nowaday or maybe few players 100+ becouse they were just bad. Rust is using the same or very similar shoting system. Shoting with some guns without moving mouse will cause your character to look at the sky in few seconds. Forcing you to move your mouse to the top/bottom of your mousepad and then your hand to the center of mousepad every time you want to do a longer spray. Shoting system from crappy FPS games of 90s. Only slide to change sensitivity. No way to precisly set your sensitivity. Maybe possible with tweaks or console commands. Slides are archaic so again return to 1990 2000 And becouse game can load extremally slow even on low med and high end PCs so 2 hours for a steam refund is a joke. There should be atleast 10. Sometimes UI isn't responsible maybe issue is on server side (lag). But this have to be recoded. Clicking an item to craft should take required resources from client and add item right after lag is off. With actual coding players are sometimes spam clicking and this causes them to build more then they wanted. Happened to me few times and this can be fixed with logical coding.My compare This game for me is much worse then MinecraftThis game for me is much worse then CS any versionThis game for me is much worse then BattlefieldThis game for me is much worse then Call of DutyFair 4/10Bought it with 50% and I think this game isn't worth the full price maybe even not worth 50% of it.

2016-12-05,0,0,200,True,Recommended,"I do recommend this game. I find it's the only game I can play for lengths on end. I do find is difficult at times to really make progress without having 24/7 to play it. However I've been playing on Community servers where there isn't decay and they're low population so it makes it better. If you have a full time job with a significant other you'll struggle to play the game to its full potential. Pros The game is beautiful. Sunsets and sunrises often make you reach for F12 and take a screenshot. Sound design is phenomenal. The developers are incredibly active and listen to the community on a lot of issues. With the addition of the ""component"" system solo players can hold their own much better against clans. The survival elements are balanced fairly well. (Heat cold hunger dehydration) It's incredibly fun to raid someone's base and reap the progress. The servers reset progress once a month to keep the playing field even from large clans. Cons Animal AI. It's being worked on but as of right now they can walk through rocks boulders and external walls so it's a pain. The community IS very toxic. I find the best solution for this is to play on smaller community servers. I can't play on Official servers because it's awful. As of right now there is no weather system besides the fog. It was removed some time ago to be fixed so it should be back eventually. The servers reset once a month wiping all of your progress.",Rust

2015-12-15,0,0,432,True,Not Recommended,"This game is described by the developers as a survival/crafting game and the graphics are absolutely gorgeous but it is so heavily biased towards murdering psychopaths I doubt it will ever be anything but a mass murder simulator. Largely because after two years in Early Access the developers have shown absolutely no interest in fixing the horribly broken gameplay which goes like this Every few weeks the entire map is reset because the servers can't cope with all the buildings and items hoarded by the first few players who joined. These very first few players who had the time to play non stop for 20 hours after the last wipe got to hoard some automatic weapons and build inpenetrable fortresses of steel and stone. After this they spend the next few weeks sniping naked would be players who try to join the game. See the established players spawn inside their fortress next to their chest full of armor weapons and medkits while everyone else spawn naked on a beach holding a rock which will fall apart if you try to hit a tree more than a few dozen times. Collecting wood will ofcourse get you nowhere because you need cloth (which is pretty rare) stone (which is nearly impossible to come by) and animal fat (easiest to obtain by killing yourself) to craft a simple furnace smelt 100 units of metal which can then be used to craft a combination lock which can be used to lock... well whatever you would have had to lock if you hadn't been killed a LONG time ago at this point. Because of this the game quickly devolves into a bunch of desperate frustrated naked guys pummeling eachother with rocks instead of ""surviving"" and ""crafting"". All of this is accompanied by the inspiring sound of microphone toting teenage misfits telling you to f**k yourself in poor english while dismembering your corpse with a rock. If you can play this game for a week without completely losing faith in humanity you simply haven't been paying attention.",Rust

2016-01-18,0,0,362,True,Recommended,Rust is developed by the same company that made Garry's Mod which is what caught my attention when I was looking at this game the first time. I played this game using Steam Family Sharing &amp bought it after a few hours of playing.The game is build on the Unity Engine and looks great. The core gameplay and shooting mechanincs are fantastic and really surprised me. I had to get used to a few things but once you know the basics the game really grows on you. I logged 40 hours in a few days playing this to the point where I was having weird dreams about the game. That's usually when I know I have a winner.I stopped playing for a month and came back to tons of updates. The game is actively updated on a weekly basis with significant game improvements. They have an active dev log on their website and on the game so you know what's up. I wouldn't hesitate recommending this game.Update 11/22/2017 Still going strong. It's worth popping in every few months to see the progress. You get essentially a new game a few times a year.,Rust

Now bright side is that there is some good ppl will not kill you for stupid things that you got or either what you have lots things easy to know where things genrated materials spawn at there is some good ppl who willing help you.

The developers instead are focused on Rust ""2.0"". The naysayers which included me complained that the developers were simply stalling and had not intention to improve the game. However over the last month Rust 2.0 has started to evolve to become a real (albeit buggy) game. The graphics in 2.0 are outstanding and it brings a look/feel that 1.0 can't touch.

Honestly I have no idea what the actual game is like but I hope it's good for the other people playing this game. This is my own personal experience of ""Rust"" that has been infuriating which is if you have not been reading up to this point been a massive waste of money due to it's being broken for me . Come on FacePunch fix your damn game. At least make a good loading screen for people who don't have computers with top of the line components. ZERO OUT OF TEN WOULD UNINSTALL AGAIN!Even though large tracts of Europe and many old and famous States have fallen or may fall into the grip of the Gestapo and all the odious apparatus of Nazi rule we shall not flag or fail.

2015-06-06,0,0,2,True,Not Recommended,"I'm going to have to go against the tide here and say that Rust was something of a disappointment for me. Although there are some verifiably comical moments to be had (such as being stoned to death by someone in the buff upon attempting to purloin their torch as they sleep) there unfortunately isn't a lot of substance beyond that.First is the incessant crashing to desktop. Okay okay I know it's an alpha and such things are to be expected but Rust is probably the first game I've played that does it literally every twenty minutes. I've been playing for less than an hour and the game crashed three times in that short period. And just to rub salt in my eyes I'll find that once I've returned to the server to start playing again everything I've spent the past half hour gathering has been robbed by a passer by putting me straight back to square one.Speaking of ""gathering"" survival is extremely difficult even for a walking simulator (not least because of the looming threat of crashing to desktop and having everything you own burgled). Getting off of the beach where you first spawn is easy enough but after that it just becomes a pain usually the biggest threat in a walking sim is having your food stolen by a pack of bandits but in Rust the issue lies in getting food in the first instance. My first thought was to harvest fruits and the like of which there are precisely none in the starting area. Hunting is also frustrating especially given that the first proper weapon you get in the game will barely tickle the creature being hunted which is also faster than you. Fishing is also a non thing so literally the only way for a newbag to procure food and drink (here I should think I could drink from the river but apparently not...) is to overpower some unsuspecting adventurer and rob his stuff. Or if he has no food eat him instead (cannibalism is a thing in Rust).So we move on to what I found to be the only good thing about Rust (and let's face it the overwhelming majority of positive reviews here are about this) that being the fact that one can strut around in one's birthday suit and beat one another to death with rocks. However other than this bit of humour the game has little else to offer in the field of actual gameplay. Like I said I've only played for an hour or so and I'll probably play it a little more to see if it gets any better (in which circumstance I'll write a considerably less damning review). But frankly I don't have a very good first impression of Rust.",Rust

2016-07-10,0,0,1223,True,Recommended,UPDATE!With a new component system my opinion has changed.Game finally got back the miracle of randomness in what you may find and got rid of XP progression.Progression that has put everyone s learning and progress into same order which in my opinion does not really suit survival based game.Component system ensures that each time you join new server you have a balanced field to catch up with people who may have played there longer than you did.All items can be found anywhere in the map so the old trend of large groups camping certain areas and preventing solos to get useful things is no longer a problem.In the same time your progress transfer between servers is not an issue anymore there is simply no progress in the game at this point.Its all about farming.Component encourages more PVP as everyone is forced to go outside and look for certain components required to craft certain high end items.So you will no longer see people camping inside their bases solely using quarries to pump out resources of turrets to kill an animal that clipped through their wall and farm its food.,Rust

2018-04-08,0,0,808,False,Not Recommended,Just to mention I ve been playing this game for a while now and it has been one of if not my favorite game. However it has gone through some changes which have affected the game negatively. Please read through my guide as it will dramatically improve your choice of buying this game.Positives of rust after the October 6th update One of the best features of rust is that the Developers are active and frequently update the game making the strain less on low end computers and laptops. (This could vary for people depending on who you are). The game is now significantly more difficult. Basically if you are looking to play on official server solo and want to get to the top. Good luck. They have made the game so difficult that you need to invest at least half your day each day to be able to raid and succeed in official servers. Farming endlessly for hours and that s if a giant zerg or clan with 10 20 people don t come along and camp the rad towns. This could be a goal for some people which is why I put it in the positive and negative section. Amazing community servers which are honestly from my experience 1000x better than the official servers (Go to the end to see what server I play in which is actually good).Negatives of rust after the October 6th update To begin the community is cancerous. 99% of the time when playing solo you ll come across an annoying 8 year old kid screaming into his/her mic making you deaf. Helk who is the new game developer has redefined the definition of fun in the game. Fun is now running around in a clan of 15 members farming the rad towns. Before the update solo players duos and small clans could easily get the equipment s that giant clans had but in a lesser amount. Still giving them a chance to raid and take on even the mightiest of clans. It was the best feeling to get some of the loot from a clan with 10 people with your friend. Now we get to the main point of why I don t recommend this game to anyone. The game currently is getting worse and worst each month. The developers make one good update and then ruin it with a terrible update such as the upkeep box which forces people to get on everyday for 1 hour farming to feed your base so that it doesn t cripple and expose your loot. Also gone are the days where you could make a 20 story bases with your friends and enjoy shooting down on people. Now to make bases like that force you to get on for at least 2 3 hours farming wood stone and high quality metal. The first time I started playing the game I had no friends to help me out and I was completely on my own. However the concept of the game was simple back then. Farm build raid enjoy. This however has been significantly extended after Oct 6th. Now it s farm for wood farm stone farm metal farm scrap (which takes days to do) farm even more scraps to get a workbench make a base get resources to feed the upkeep box to stop the base from crippling get scraps to research the gunpowder BP Get more scraps to research either satchels c4s or rocket launcher raid get raided by a try hard drug addicted no life clan with 20 people in it. Repeat. Also have fun getting scraps as you need to forget about your real life. You need to spend days if not weeks getting scraps. So leave your job leave your family leave your kids and eat instant noodles.So after making your base you think you can relax and maybe get a girlfriend or go out with your friends or visit your family right? No problem however make sure to log on 4 hours a day to feed your base so it doesn t decay and fall apart.And if you think these are all the problems you re wrong. If I where to list the problems of this game the list would be endless. If you are thinking about buying this game then please do. But don t play official servers because it will only cause you anger and hate. But every cloud has a silver lining and in this case It is the community servers. Community servers bring back all the good times of rust when it didn t go all to If you re interested in playing with me enjoying and experiencing the golden age of rust then join the server given below. It brings back the full experience of before October 6th + way more. No need to grind all day. Hacking detection is near perfect and the community is friendly. Keep in mind the server is new and we need new players to populate the server. Don t forget the tell the owner who invited you.Server RustAddiction AU/NZ 5X TP Just copy and paste this server into the community section in the servers list and you re set for endless fun.So again the question come back. Should you buy this game?I ll be straight forward with you and won t waste your time.Play community servers such as RustAddiction AU/NZ 5X TP .But if you want to waste your life and you aren t interested in ANY social activities then play official servers.,Rust

2018-07-02,0,0,24,False,Not Recommended,"Welp I was hoping that I wouldn't write a review for this game but I gotta do this for those of you wanting to supplement for Fallout 76 until it comes out. This is my first ever review and I wanted to get my thoughts out on Rust since I put in 22 hours into it. I was interested in the way it takes the survival mechanics of ARK and mixes in a little bit of STALKER. However I was met with dissapointment because of the way the game implements its survival mechanics and PvP. Let me start off by saying that the main component of Rust is boring as all hell. You go grind for wood stone and other craftables to fortify your base and beef up your items and weapons. There are optional places to go if you want extra blueprints and/or weapons. These areas offer more reward than just your regular forest areas and do provide worthwhile loot given where you go. However the default game takes way too long to get to a point where you feel comfortable with your base and items. The base game only provides a small amount of stuff whenever you grind and it gets boring real fast. You feel the hours ticking as you grind for stuff. There are animals and npcs that you can kill for either food or other valuables but their AI is so braindead that it hardley feels rewarding to kill let alone loot. I had to play modded servers that provided 50x loot in order to actually play the game given I have to work 25+ hours a week. There is also a game mechanic where given how much you build for your base it requires an x amount of crafting materials in order for your base to not deteriorate. So not only do you have to grind to make your base as fortified as possible but you need about half the amount you made for your base to keep it from falling apart. So coupled with how much you have to grind to build a base it takes longer to keep it from deteriorating. That is if you can actually build a base worth a damn because the main mechanic of the game is being an absolute and ing up.The default game mode is literally griefing other players and trolling them. In order to progress per say you need to kill other players and grab their stuff. This provides access for better weapons and other valuables that may come in handy if you decide to kill someone and/or raid a base. This would be fine if there were dedicated PvP areas in the game and if there was a faction system and a war mode implemented. However as the game stands no rules apply to how PvP works in the normal game mode. You could literally ""Spawn and Die"" to someone if they have played the game 100 1000+ hours on a certain server or the game in general. You could even spawn into your base and be absolutely screwed. For the server that I was playing on I had an excellent system for my base. It was close to a mountain side with no outpust/monumets around. The only way to enter it is to platform on the side of the mountain and to dodge the traps I laid along the foundation of the base. However I was met with shock when I come back to my game my character was walled off. Everything that I had saved up for 20+ hours was gone in an instant with no way to recover. To make matters worse the player was mocking me and calling me "" face"" while wasting away all my ammo and loot.Do not I repeat do not buy the game at full price. The game is barely worth the $8 I spent because of how ridiculously tedious it is and how God Awful the playerbase is. If you can stick to the modded servers. I recommend either the ""Battle Royale"" servers or ""Battlefield"" servers to actually enjoy the game. As it stands it is not worth your time or patience to play the game normally.

2016-08-13,1,2,2270,True,Recommended,Rust is a Realistic Survival MMO.Gameplay In Rust you start out with a rock and a torch from there the first things to do is collect some wood using your rock. Throughout the game you will get killed many times if you are playing on a popular server. After putting in some time you will have collect enough wood and stone to start creating tools to speed up how long it takes to gather resources. Overall it will be challenging to get started but after a while you will learn more of what to do and how to craft items in Rust.Graphics/ Sound Rust has some really nice graphics if you have some of the setting turned up. Rust also has some music during the loading screen and throughout the gameMultiplayer Rust has a very active community on a range of different servers. Some servers are just plain vanilla and have no mods at all. Other servers may have things like 3X XP or other perks to help speed up the process of creating tools and a base. Cost Rust is priced at $20 at the time of this review and I think that Rust is priced well for what it offers right now. But i would suggest picking Rust up when its on sale for $10. Some sites like Humble Bundle you can even pick up Rust cheaper through their bundles while also supporting charity.Time Rust takes a good 5 10 hours to be at a point where you can go offline without dying. Pros Realistic Active Multiplayer community Only $20 Great Team gameCons Can be hard to run on lower hardware Server wipes Time consumingI would give Rust a 9/10 Total Rating,Rust
2014-07-10,0,0,1442,True,Not Recommended,"Do NOT buy this game until it is out of ""Early Access"" or whatever BS label they are giving it. They totally scrapped the semi functional alpha version of this game to toss 100% of their support into an experimental branch that has virtually none of the features of the aplha which they chose to scrap. We now have a game which was semi playable being scrapped for a game that is entirely unplayable. To add insult to injury they don't even support the official servers anymore. The ""East Coast Server 1"" that I play on has been down all day without any maintenance or anything.There is growing concern among the player base that this game will never even reach alpha state again much less ever be released. Garry is a terrible developer when it comes to actually releasing games and making tangible progress. He started Garry's Mod over more than half a dozen times. Why would a developer take millions of dollars from players with a game that was so terrible they now have to start from scratch? That's just outright fraud to sell a game as in an alpha stage when it is so bad it is scrapped altogether. Garry basically charged us all $20 for a game he hasn't even started on yet.Avoid this game at all costs until the 5 7 years it takes Garry to make any real progress on it. Perhaps wait for them to support the servers and community in some fashion too? It's worth noting this game was released in December 2013 and it is currently being started from scratch. Does anyone else find a release date for a game that hasn't even begun development yet dishonest?",Rust

2016-08-20,6,10,2869,False,Not Recommended,The game used to be pretty fun but now it's just grind grind and more grind. Long story short every update seems to make the game worse and less enjoyable. Save your money and go buy something else that is actually backed by reputable developers and financial support. Investing in Facepunch is nothing more than a facepalm of disappointment.UPDATE Not a lot has changed from the above since the game left Early Access. Some things got fixed that took about three years to get fixed but that's about it. A whole slew of things were never fixed before the game left Early Access still aren't fixed it's still not optimized and the game post Early Access is still just as much of a mess as it was when it was in the program. Grind is even worse now as the game remains so imbalanced.The new Blueprint System and other ideas the developers chose have literally ruined the game for many thousands of players prior and post Early Access. The community is worse content creators are giving up on the game toxicity is out of control and the game has become so infested with children that it's just not a fun game for a lot of adults to hang out and game anymore.Sure Rust has seen some new map content but it's more or less the same kind of content Rust has seen over the years only now the company is trying to give the game some kind of lore in an environment of mismatched theme and language. Rust is pretty much a rinse and repeat of other (I won't name titles) certain FPS survival games mashed into one with a lot of things that have pretty much been ripped concepts from other games with only a reskin and a sound change. That's not very thoughtful or creative.Post Early Access the company changes core mechanics of the game such as gun play and other various things. These are features that should have been completed and refined during the Early Access phase of the game but they were not and for some reason keep changing time and again.Cheating is also another issue that's plagued Rust for years and in spite all the developers saying they are finally addressing issues as of this month but it's honestly a bit late for that. The cheaters have already left a sour taste in peoples' mouths and a lot of people will not return to Rust because this comapny took way too long to address those issues.All in all Rust has been four and a half year's time not well spent. The game is still largely broken incomplete is considered an alpha still by the developers and best of all they are charging full retail price for a game that was never completed before exit from Early Access and it will not be completed by the end of 2018 post exit Early Access. The developers have been too careless during Rust's development. Rust holds very limited quality of sustainability when it comes to game play that's if you can get the game to work. Many people still can't get Rust to work even months after the game left Early Access because something the developers changed screwed the game up. Worse is the developers are charging full retail price for this broken and incomplete buggy mess of an unoptimized game.Conclusion Hands down there are many many other better and completed games out there to buy from reputeable companies that do not have a terrible history such as Facepunch Studios.A company that can only produce one game in the company's launch year and only another incomplete and broken game fourteen and a half years later is not a sign of a good developer. This company left Chunks (another game they're apparently making) in Early Access for literally almost two entire years before giving it a minor patch last November 2017 so it didn't appear abandoned. They also lied in the developer description saying the game would be done in about two to four months. Well we're past two years now and it's not done.A developer that cancels and abandons more than half a dozen projects in under a year and leaves games hang stale in Early Access for so long without an update is a definite sign of a company that does not properly finish what it starts very often. Rust falls into that category. Rust is in year five of alpha development outside of Early Access.,Rust

2016-04-14,0,0,368,True,Recommended,Since buying this game on release day and playing through to the current patch I can 100% say this game is a must have. The dev team behind this game is amazing they are constantly chekcing out user created content and taking suggestions from reddit and the community page. Over the years this game has seen some major changes with a complete graphics overhaul huge changes in the core mechanics. Looking at this game from day 1 to now its like 2 completely diferrent games. There is new content almost every week and development is showing no signs of slowing down. The game is still in Alpha after almost 3 years because they keep adding more and more to the game. Just today they added flamethrowers in. The community is a lot of fun and the game mostly rewards group play and being an alpha there is plenty of fun to be had with various glitches and bugs. Plenty of love has gone into this game and the devs just aren't ready to quit. This game is definitely one to check out.,Rust

2017-10-04,1,1,27,True,Not Recommended,"Play a game that decides on what gender and race you get to be for the entire game. I can see how this can promote roleplay but that only added to the confusion to a 12 22 majority age group that just play shooting games all day. The gameplay is simple to understand. It is streamlined for the things that you can accomplish by how much manpower you got. Savaging harvesting building the joy of doing all of those things just by meetings of chance. Now to the main points to why you should not support design choices of this game. Every Update is a server wipe of about a week. Now many new beginnings and ending can be made in this case but whatever happens in the game is purely effected by the Upbringing of the individual with their Real life opinions. Now some background.Item skins are gifted and not founded in the Steam inventory. A neat feature that is a community cash grab of chance. Character Model is randomly generated. Demographic of Race and Gender is randomly selected. However there is a problem the hate problem. People Will kill other people for no reason based on Skin Color a strange dilemma that sets society back in the game world back 200 years when computers should never exist. To whoever few that are ""gifted"" with this dilemma will have it harder for themselves to befriend certain likewise white skinned player models with ironic shaved heads everyone has.Personal experience aside I got lynched in a regional dedicated server. This is what makes Rust not playable no open and not where the joy is found for the future expectations of the players. To conclude I will get my purchase potentially refunded and removed after I post my only screenshot of the game.",Rust

2016-08-23,0,0,2,True,Not Recommended,I recently picked up Rust included with the recent Humble Bundle. In Rust I ended up just running randomly around an island full of little bases with security doors looking for naked guys to bludgeon until I starved to death. There was nothing to pick up and nothing to do except wander past all these base like buildings entering the ones I could and destroying a few random objects. The fact that Rust is a multi player game is the biggest drawback. It's hard to get immersed in a survival game where you start out with a rock and some of an island's population is mowing you down with flame throwers and automatic weapons. This is not a survival game. It is a small world persistent deathmatch that shoehorns all of its players into a small area to build there little bases and go at it. The islands I spawned on looked less like isolated islands and more like little cities of player bases with naked guys wandering around smashing each other hoping not to run into someone with a gun. This game is like telling new Battlefield players they need to spawn in with a toothbrush. This is the game I bought the Humble Bundle to play and is ironically the only one I've uninstalled. k,Rust

2017-08-09,0,0,83,True,Not Recommended,Never in my life have I felt such utter disgust and contempt towards a game in my steam library. This is without a doubt the biggest waste of money on Steam. For starters it's an unoptimised mess with an art style that makes you want to vomit. When you load into a server be prepared to go and put the kettle on and prepare some scones as this will take an infuriatingly long time. 60 of my 76 hours on this game are from loading screens.Is it worth the long loading time? To put it bluntly no. After selecting a server from the server list made up of either cancerous custom ones ran by 10 year olds or the poorly maintained official ones be prepared for what will feel like virtual labour work. You start with a rock and simply have to hit things with the rock. Does that sound like a fun time to you? If you even manage to waste enough time to get weaponry on this game be prepared for some absolutely appaling combat. The guns are not satisfying to use and you can get a lag spike when firing the weapon due to the already mentioned apalling state of the game's engine.The objective of this so called 'game' is to make a base. That's it. There is no engaging story or any kind of ulterior motive. Simply just make a metal building on a map full of children. It's all well and dandy once you've established your base of operations but try taking a break from this game. You can't. You are simply punished for it. Priviliged children who spend all their lives on this sorry excuse for a game will destroy it whilst you are going about your day to day business. If by some miracle this doesn't happen it doesn't matter anyway because nearly all the servers get wiped on a weekly basis so you will lose all your hard work anyway. Enjoy.I strongly recommend you steer clear of this game and play a game for real men like Kingdom Hearts. Thank you for reading this.,Rust

The only way to keep it fun for people like me is to be forced to join group limited servers. I thought Rust was supposed to be a survival game i don't see point of the genre when people are in a massive clan aka zerg.Not to mention the steam sale that occured last december. Are you guys actually rétarded? Giving hackers the chance to buy rust for 50% off on their mule accounts. I encouter hackers daily now so it is time to quit this game.

2014-05-25,0,0,1786,True,Recommended,Well the game itself is fantastic but it soon gets bored. Vanilla unmodded servers I'm not sure about stuff like remove I think should have been there as standard (I mean if you place something IRL you can move it right? It's only like placing a fence post?).That said the building possibilities are rather endless and it's a very fun Adult Version of minecraft.The sheer number of hackers and buggy combat however is what let's it down which is a shame because it's the most important part of the game.Durability doesn't happen on a Hunter Bow yet a metal gun's durability fails fast what's that all about?The new experimental stage of the game I've tried looks pretty but framerates are much lower than current and the new interface is going to annoy some of the 1k+ hour players (it looks nice but it's not rust if you get me).Being able to build on water and live in rocks etc can't belive that's still never been fixed. Duping is easy on laggy servers and players with a high ping generally have a decent advantage to a low ping player. Playing with 35ping makes it super hard to kill someone with 350ping in comparison to another 35 45ping player.Because of this servers should auto kick HPB's.,Rust

2015-01-30,0,0,1538,True,Recommended,For me is RUST the best game 2014 2015 already and here is why.First of all i got 385 hours in this game and dont really feel like i wasted time even when i did.Second both the old and the new RUST are both already great games and the new one get even better almost every week!To all the bad revies i can only say look at the people that give bad reviews here and their play time there are people with 300+ hours playtime for a price under 30$ who whine because they dont like the game anymore after again 300+ hours.If Garry keeps his motivation and fun that he has right now in developing this Pearl and he completes his mindmap than RUST will be the Survival/Sandbox Genre God!All of this is just my Opinion and i never say its the overall opinion but i hope the people that read this (maybe even in a voice that sounds like my bad english writing skills) will think about what i wrote and make their own opinions and dont just copy the most famous opinions.,Rust

2018-01-19,1,1,1,True,Not Recommended,Decided to buy the game so i can play with a friend and his wife. Bought it for 18$ on Humble bundle. Wish I bought it on steam so i could refund it. The graphics are so bad if you get on a server with a population you die withing a minute if not less. Which is exactly why i never wanted to buy the game. Unless you have no life and play 10 20hrs a day on this horindous game and have a huge team that has rotating schedule and already end game gear you have absolutely no chance in being able to do anything with the game. Yes people will say with the dumbest response of get good. Well when you die within a minute of spawning no matter what server you're on its not possible. I honesly will do whatever I can to get my money back from this game. I really cant stand this garbage. lastly the graphics are complete garbage sound effects are incredibly cheap the animations are like you'd get from the game 2nd life. This game is a disgrace. Its been in early access for years and it looks like there has been no progress. I honestly prefer cancer than keeping this game in my library.,Rust

2014-07-22,2,1,576,True,Recommended,You start with a rock to collect rocks and sticks to put a rock on a stick to collect more rocks and sticks and at some point in this chain of events you're killed and your body is looted. Though after being robbed a few times you may just make friends with someone. That friend will rob you becuase they're a spy for a group of bandits. Eventually you make a new friend one that's not a bandit (if you're lucky). This friend will give you a gun maybe in my case they did. Now that you have a gun you can defend your self from other people with guns next time you hop on the server you're playing on because it's late and you have stuff to do in the morning.You awake to see a nice sunrise look around and realize you're standing in the middle of a field with no gear. Turns out you were killed in your sleep. You may be a bit bummed out. Maybe you can try to start a new life wherever you spawned? but first look out for that radioactive bear that's about to murder you.10/10 will be raided again. Good game so far just want some more stuff to maybe defend myself from raiders.,Rust

2016-05-04,0,0,95,True,Not Recommended,"Rust is the defining survival/gatherer game and it has been under development for quite some time. I also receives very regular updates and from what I understand the developers communicate with the community a lot. However I cannot recommend this game in its current form.The game is predominently PvP and with that comes all the ugliness of an anonymous community. You will be shot stabbed and stomped on with no reason or provocation other than it's ""fun"" to do so. You will spend hours fortifying a base only to have someone C4 it to heck while you're offline.This game needs more coherent and meaningful PvE dangers. So far you have randomly placed wildlife only two of which will attack you. You also have a patrolling helicopter that may occasionally hunt you down. It's not enough and coupled with other environmental aspects are all easily mitigated or avoided.Originally the game had radiation as a theme with irradiated towns and wildlife. The game really needs to expand on that theme and introduce things such as herds of irradiated creatures that roam the world. Events such as spikes of radiation radioactive dust storms large irraditaed creatures attacking etc. I commented a while back that Rust would be awesome if it included the cannibals from The Forest. Rust needs something like that so it can have a PvP mode for people that like that kind of thing and a PvE mode for people like me who prefer cooperation against an ever increasingly hostile world.",Rust

2017-11-04,2,1,3,True,Not Recommended,Unless you already have hundreds of hours on the game and know exactly what to do to 110% optimize every movement and start playing with zero sleep on a server every waking minute the moment a server resets you will just get killed dozens of times by griefers until you give up. Welcome to the magical world of a 4 year early access game called Rust. Enemies make no sound when approaching. All weapons kill with 2 hits. When you die you lose everything because people will camp your home and kill you over and over until yet again you give up on trying to play this game.Possibly the worst survival game I've ever played. 4 hours and I've left with the worst taste in my mouth of any game since X Rebirth which was universally hated. This game completely and entirely tailors itself to trolls so that new players will find it impossible to do anything build anything or get anywhere. Literally less than a day into this game and these trolls had guns and fortresses built and just spent their time destroying everyone elses and forcing them to quit the server out of frustration.Seriously do not buy this game if you haven't already played it so much you're a master (a paradox I know with good reason). Legitimately the positive reviews will tell you it's fun and all but like pyramid schemes these reviews are simply there to encourage new players to buy the game get destroyed by the positive reviewers that enjoy tormenting people then have them quit. Congratulations devs you've succeeded in not only facilitating griefing and trolling but tailored the game to facilitate it.,Rust

Comparing this to a game like ARK I just find ark so much more creative and imaginitive especially with base building you can really make them feel like your own and somewhere you can call home in this its just too empty.Raids can be enjoyable but you need so much equipment to even get close to making it worthwhile plus if you partner with advanced people they'll just tell you to hang back.Overall I do not enjoy this as much as I would like I dont see how my friend could have spent 800 hours on this. P.S. The communities toxic,Rust

2016-08-11,0,0,1355,True,Recommended,"Good game. extremely fun especially with friends!Still in alpha development released to us as an early access game. so expect bugs glitches and even times when the game wont work at all. Recent update has caused a small wave of butthurts to change their reviews from positive to negative. it's because Facepunch implemented an XP system. people are upset that they have to actually play the game to gear up... instead of relying on other people (Clans) to gear them up for them. this actually works out for the best. Less KOS Kiddies / Rad Town Campers / Lazies. it gives solo players like myself an actual chance of atleast setting down my foundation for my base without being raided. Facepunch did a Vote on their social media page a week or so ago asking people ""Keep XP and Improve it"" or ""Back to Blueprints"" the voted ended with over 10 000 registered votes. the XP system won by a landslide. so don't worry about the ""Most helpful Reviews"" being negative. its just the butthurts +1 upping eachother in some weird sort of circle jerk.8/10 Awesome Game and highly recommmend.PS i am sure a few butthurts will chime in below... telling me to kill myself or whatnot. these are the exact people this game DOESN'T need.",Rust

2014-04-21,0,0,3,True,Recommended,This game is pretty fun for what it is. It is basically just a harder and better looking version on Minecraft with PvP always on. Though you won't be crafting like you would in Minecraft but rather building a shelter as soon as you can to keep safe from not only the bears and other animals but the players themselves. You can go out at night but I would suggest you don't. It in Pitch Black unlike it is in minecraft so if you don't have a torch you can't see any of the animals but the players as well that will shoot to kill at least most of them will. You can get lucky and meet a friendly player but they could just be acting. So be wary of everything.Thumbs up.It's a decent game and if you like survival and crafting then you will find joy in this game.,Rust

Go be a SJW somewhere else devs!TL DR just watch this https //www.youtube.com/watch?v 25yFJQeeyZgSome of the messages on reddit The difference there is that They decided that the game would start as all male. That's pretty weird to begin with.Everyone (men and women both) who played the game were OK with male avatars. Or they would have found something better to do.Half the people (men and women both) who grew to identify with their avatar suddenly discovered that wasn't them any more. That's a way to treat people.Then the users who complained were assumed to all be men and to all be misogynists. That's an even ier way to treat people.Why punish male players for something the DEVS did? its like if you have two kids and accidentally give ice cream to one kid while the other one watches. Then on the next trip you give ice cream only to the OTHER kid to punish the first one... It's wrong because YOU were the one who messed up not the kid.With regards to the sentiment that half the player base wasn't playing as their identified gender before female models were introduced that's both false AND a stupid excuse for this move. Only 10% of the player base is female so now even less people are playing as their identified gender. And if this is about identity politics isn't it objectification or something to look at a naked woman's body? If you're going to play that card see it through so we can all see how bigoted you are.I really have no desire to see this regressive mentality tarnishing my gaming experience. Gaming is my escape one thing I want to escape from is collectivist regressive t.,Rust

2016-07-14,1,2,971,False,Not Recommended,this game. The game could be fun the only thing missing is an Anti CHEAT system. The Anti CHEAT system here is cheap and . On every server you join there will be atleast 4 ESP hackers that will always know what you have and where. They will know the best way to get to your stuff and if they ever notice you are close with stuff they will kill you and take it. When they have enough Raiding tools they will get you when they know your worth it and only get into rooms they know where loot is. You will report them with f7 and they may get banned but there just gonna buy another game copy and pay the 10 a month for the hacks. Dont buy this game The Anti CHEAT is a piece of and doesnt even do its job its just a word.It says only 600 hours but really I have played for 2000 hours. You know in games there are Cheaters but its not as obviously blatant. But when you have 30 spead out loot rooms in a 40x38 that you build with a team of 3 and you get on during a raid on you and notice that they only got into the rooms they knew the core loot was in AKA 3 out of 30 and none of it was close together and everything else was ignoured. Its petty as to think the devs dont realize the biggest issue with there game. No one wants new things when the here already isnt working. No car is gonna make these guys stop Cheating no fish net no double barrel nothing. Just make a ing real anti Cheat or go with battleeye Cheaters rip there eyes out and bleed them slow as well as murder there ing children and the resto f there families.Its not just this game either dont get me wrong its the issue with online games these days... people want cheats. other people dont want to play games with cheaters.

Even though it's been about two years since Rust was released and even if it's still in Alpha version this game rocks. Development never stops and the community grows and grows. Hell where else are you going to see naked sausage fest? Where else are you going to get killed by a naked man who will after teabag you? That's right nowhere. Rust is definitely one of the games you should try. It's definitely worth paying the money for what you get.I used to have a server last year with Rust Legacy and now I own the latest version of the Rust server and I would say it's awesome.

2014-03-28,1,2,343,True,Not Recommended,Wow so what can I say about this game.First of all I was really excited about it and dove into it head first. After buying it I gifted it to 2 people and even rented my own server. I haven't played for about 3 weeks but as of then you could not play on any official server or a lot of community servers. Hackers and cheaters everywhere.So then I spent money to rent my own server because I think the game has great potential and looks very good for an alpha game.Then boredom. There is just not enough to do in the game and the development progress seems extremely slow. Also if anyone has told you that the RUST community is overall horrible. It's all true. I think the average player is 10 years old. Also the moderators running their official forum not even 10 years old maybe 5.I spent about $90 on an alpha game and that was a lesson learned the hard way.,Rust

2016-05-28,0,0,219,True,Not Recommended,Old Review Nice game but it crashes after every 2 minutes(for me at least but other people could have the same issue as well). I don't recommend it unless these frequent crashes will get handled they are really annoying when you're geared and a naked runs up to your sleeper.Also nerf bears. Old Review Ends Here PEOPLE MAY NOT ENTIRELY AGREE WITH MEMy main issue with this game is that the clans rule the servers completely and utterly which renders solo survival or survival with a smaller non clan group almost impossible without getting crushed over time. My other main problem is the immediate hostility of the people you meet unlike it was in Legacy where you could meet people who actually help you which (truth be told) isn't the case anymore(sadly). I can't recommend this game in it's current state because of the community it's a waste of time and money.,Rust

It gets frustrating at times but you soon learn that you just gotta bite the bullet sometimes literally(in the game of course) and rebuild. Rust has many unique features about it but I think the most wonderful of them all is the community. If you are a first time ruster you better expect to see some crazy yet mostly hilarious things in the server chat and if you participate in the chat it becomes even better!

2016-08-18,0,0,6,True,Recommended,As I died screaming between a wolf s jaws collapsing in the snow that dusts the top of the mountains while listening to it gnaw through virtual flesh I had a realization survival games are fun as long as they are about the threat of death.Death itself is underwhelming a gateway to an ever increasing set of chores and tasks that you must repeat in order to recover your lost progress. Inevitably the process eventually repeats and the to do list gets longer and less fulfilling which sounds a little bit like hell and a little bit like a parable about the human condition. Rust official site the multiplayer survival game from Facepunch Studios seems comfortable with both analogies.If you re not familiar with Rust or if you only know it as the Survival Game with Lots of it s actually a weirder and more interesting game than it first appears to be. You wake up in a strange landscape cold and naked with nothing but a torch and a rock to your name. Then after a few minutes of trial and error exploration of Rust s wilderness you can start building crude tools out of loose materials then using those tools to harvest more material to build better tools etc. The tech tree runs from Stone Age materials all the way to automatic weapons and heavy body armor. Survival in Rust can become a fairly comfortable survivalist s fantasy if you stay alive long enough but death comes swiftly and with little warning.Rust is the closest I ve ever come in a videogame to feeling like I was living in The Most Dangerous Game or The Ruum or any of those pursuit and survival classics that students read every year in middle school. Every player you meet is potentially a mortal threat or a potential ally which is common enough for a survival multiplayer game except that Rust also functions a bit like a social experiment. It s like someone gave Stanley Milgram a private island a private army and an endless supply of willing prisoners and said See what you can make happen here. Every few hours in game a cargo plane flies overhead and makes a supply drop that draws players from all around the map into a highly charged dangerous confrontation over the mere possibility of treasure. There might be nothing very special in those supply drops but there might be advanced gear that would be difficult or impossible to craft yourself.Alternately an attack helicopter sometimes appears to hunt down and kill any players that it manages to see and its appearance is as chilling as it is unexplained. It s existence is contrived like everything else in Rust s deserted semi industrial wilderness but still unsettling. It s something that forces me to consider what Rust looks like from above as a bunch of half naked violent and greedy people try and create peace and security for themselves in a setting of profound anarchy.But eventually you die. You didn t hide quickly enough and the helicopter mows you down in the open or you were too busy stalking a deer to notice someone has been stalking you for the past few minutes and literally all you hear is a shot before the world turns red and you drop to the ground. Or you die in the dumbest of ways taking a shortcut over a mountain and a wolf walks up a near vertical cliff face to surprise you at the exact moment that you don t have any of your good weapons equipped in the hotbar. A few impotent stabs with your spear later (a weapon with the worst hit detection in the game) and you re back to square one naked and alone.Well almost. Rust is also a game about securing property rights in an anarchic world a John Locke essay with a flintlock blunderbuss and magical crafting items. When you die you have the option to wake up again at a sleeping bag you ve left somewhere out in the world. Ideally inside a home you ve built next to a supply cache and behind a locked door. With a little foresight you can leave an inheritance for yourself of decent tools materials and weapons so that you can get right back to your survival saga of living by your wits and slowly becoming predator rather than prey in this hostile world. If you build a tool cabinet inside then nobody else can construct anything near your stuff letting you securely lay claim to territory. After a couple deaths I was building two of everything and jamming my hilltop fortress full of weapons and material.But some loss of progress is inevitable and if you get on a bad run that little rainy day fund will get depleted and eventually you re back to being alone with a rock and virtual genitalia (which will of course be the name of my forthcoming memoir). At that point Rust becomes a far less joyous and evocative experience and something a lot more like shift work. The first time you hunt a half dozen animals and smelt enough metal ore to create advanced weapons and armor you feel like Ash in Army of Darkness. The fourth time you do it and you re chopping down yet another tree with a stone hatchet or chasing a deer around some rocks? It starts to feel like survival might be a punishment rather than a goal.The weird thing is I think that s contributed to a strange sense of community on some servers. A year or so ago Rust sounded like a game full of half naked sociopaths killing each other in front of a pig s skull. Now while there s still a heavy air of distrust that hangs over the proceedings there s also more respect and cooperation. Neighbors ask to borrow tools to get back on their feet. Warnings go out regarding particularly violent players who are causing trouble. It s not that Rust is turning into some kind of utopian experiment but it s definitely less the anarchy that it was in the past. Live and let live seems to be the rule in Rust unless someone has REALLY nice stuff and you have a clear shot.There is an irony to success in Rust the better you are at surviving the less that will actually happen. Just before writing this I spent a couple hours upgrading my building building new weapons and ammunition and collecting extra supplies to keep behind a new electronic lock. I have windows that afford me a view in every direction and a kind of parapet on the third floor from which I can shoot down at anyone who starts trying to batter down my walls. I spend most of my time hiding from other players now or hiding from the helicopter or watching out for bears and wolves. When I think about a typical session of Rust it s a catalog of things that didn t happen of risks successfully avoided and bets wisely hedged. The brilliance of Rust is that it demands a lot of suspenseful work attention and planning to make sure that it remains uneventful.,Rust

2017-03-04,0,0,745,True,Recommended,"After around an hour and a half of bad spawns scarce resources and short lived ventures into the more inhabited areas of the map I ran into the first friendly player I had met in Rust. I had initially spotted him pretty far away but I paid no real notice to him as he had a rock equipped. Eventually he got close enough for us to clearly see each other and upon the realization that neither of us were hostile we both pulled out torches as a mutual sign of peace (or the highest possible level of non aggression that can exist in Rust). I dropped my old hatchet for him as I had just finished crafting one with metal and he gave me some food as a sign of good faith. After nearly 30 minutes of searching and scavenging we had pooled enough resources to craft us each some minimally decent gear. We knew that if we wanted to progress any further we would need to mine boulders and a lot of them. I used what remaining materials we had to put together a 9mm handgun and several bullets though I reminded him it was only in case we really needed it. I had decided earlier during my many unwanted experiences with bullets to the face that I would try my hardest not to run around slaughtering every newly spawned player that I came across. A few minutes out from camp we had encountered a player with a hunting bow. I had been running with my hatchet out so I quickly took out the handgun in my inventory and pointed it in his direction attempting to scare him away. When the player was far enough away we continued up a road towards a few stones. The area was surrounded by trees so I opted to stand guard with the handgun while my friend mined. Just as we were moving on to the next boulder I heard the gunfire start. I turned around to see a player with an assault rifle gunning down my friend and before I could land any shots on him he had already begun shooting me. It was at that moment that I remembered I hadn't even crafted a sleeping bag for the camp as that was one of the objectives of the trip we were taking. I typed into the chat thanking the friend I had made for all of his help and asking the player who had killed us if we had been intruding in his area or something along those lines. He simply wrote ""Sorry guys D"" This is the single problem that I have with games like this. Why does it have to be ""shoot on sight?"" That player had obviously taken us by surprise and was better equipped than us. Even if he had a justifiable reason for approaching two very poorly equipped players (which he really didn't considering we were in the middle of the woods and he had pretty much all of the gear you could need in this game) he could have easily told us to cooperate by either putting away our weapons or just leaving the area. But of course he comes around sees some players trying to gather enough supplies to get to a stable point in the game and decides to go out of his way to approach us and use unecessary ammo for a hatchet and a handgun with four bullets. Then to add even more of an insult he adds an apology at the end as if he had no choice but to shoot two unexpecting half naked unprepared players. All in all though I do see a lot of potential in this game and the good in the community does shine through every once in a while. I just wish that people would realize that they don't need to go around killing players who haven't had the chance to experience the game. People like that are the single reason why so many players on steam feel that they wasted money on what would otherwise be a great experience.",Rust

I decided to install it and choose legacy just to notice that the legacy option is no longer there. (Legacy being the old and in my oppinion more enjoyable version of rust)I took a while to look at all the different versions to make sure that none of them are legacy and sure enough they weren't. I kept looking around in guides and the such for a while only to find out that they removed legacy. If you ask me that is the most stupid move this company could make seeing as from what I remember even legacy had a decent playerbase.I wish I could refund this just to get my money back but I can't so atleast I can feel like about 37 hours were well spent in legacy and that I'll never touch this game again unless they bring it back.I even played this game before it became the completely new game that it is now. Back when legacy wasn't called legacy. I miss those times but it seems like facepunch are happy to just give me a punch right in the face for thinking that. I am seriously dissapointed by this move and I in no way support it. Legacy was one of those very rare survival games that I could enjoy and actually do stuff in.I miss legacy already but I guess I'll just have to live with that.

Getting on to a new server all I see is metal ore and sulfur ore nodes and not a one stone node in sight. I guess players are expected to use their rock forever until they somehow get enough bones for a bone club come across the rare stone node or come across the rare crate that holds tools. They really need to remove this new node change because it has completely turnt me off the game. Other than the early game being completely ruined on a game that already has a very difficult early game the game in general can be quite fun.

2014-02-02,0,0,60,True,Recommended,Rust is a awesome game and you should buy it if you like to have a high textured minecraft with elements of Day Z in the mix with extremely good lighting effects. Play it in 1 of 3 ways Lone wolf style this is where you play it solo and killing everything and everything in sight. Bandit Style Group with some people and raid peoples houses and take there loot and shoot and kill anything and everything that gets in your way. and finaly the friendly group In this style you play with a group and only shoot if they atack first and give the friendlys some unwanted gear and give them some of the basics Wood Rocks and a bow but no arrows so that concludes the styles of play. now the gear and weapons they still need some balancing and tweeking and theres only 3 types of ammo that is a bit odd but still kevlar is the best armor in the game and theres 3 other tears that works up to kevlar Cloth Teir 1 Leather Teir 2 Anti Rad suit Teir 3 and then kevlar i feel that there should be atleast 6 other teirs there 2 Pistols The M9 and the P250 is 1 assault rifle the M4 1 sniper The Bolt Action Rifle and 1 shotty NEEDS MUCH MORE WEAPONS. over all the game is still a alpha and most or all of this will change is the flowing updates and if you buy it now you will watch a masterpeice of survival and crafting come up from the ground. so yeah VERY GOOD GAME,Rust

2014-07-25,0,0,691,True,Recommended,"Tried to make a headshot from over 500 meters didn't make it Tried again at 250 meters Didn't make it Tried once again at 100 meters Didn't work. I thought about it for the next couple of days. Went on a modded server with kits and killed a couple guys. Went back on that server and tried again Nothing. I thought is pvp off? So I asked my friend ""May I hit you with my pickaxe?"" and he said ""Yes but not in the head"" I don't know what he means because I don't think that the pickaxe does any more damage to the head so without realizing that it does I hit him straight in the head killing him. Pretty good experience to start the game.A week later I hopped on a Battlefield server made a couple friends and we took out over 100 guys. Not different guys some over and over again but I was so pumped about my skills I went on a community server. With all of my training gone to work I was so happy of this battle I was in.So heres the battle I was running threw hanger and I saw a guy in full Kevlar/M4 so I went up and said ""Friendly"" Like most friendly people do.But he starting shooting I went behind him with my stone hatchet and starting hacking. Eventually I slaughtered him took his gear and that was that. That's how I started into the game. Still with people helping me throughout the gameplay. I'm so thankful to the people who helped my start on my gameplay throughout the game. Its a very fun game and kind of realistic because the zombies were removed. So once I hopped back onto the Battlefield server I went over to my friends and they said ""Congratulations!"" and then we killed more people training me more. Until this moment was my first real rust fight.There was a admin being abusive and my friend said ""We should go check it out"" and my other friend said ""Yeah and kill the admin teach him a lesson"" I was so freaking nervous that I almost died during the fight. I killed him while 3 of the team was dead only me and my other friend alive I was hiding so there was no way they saw me so I sneaked up behind him killed him and took his admin armor. My friends said I deserve it and so did the owner of the server. The admin got banned from the server. So far I have around 150 hours on rust. Got it over a month ago. I love this game so much that... I just can't say its one of the best games I have ever played. Never got bored in it Because once I'm done with my daily work I go out raid some people and maybe even get into some trouble. I love this game and I highly recommend it for anyone that likes survival games.Thank you for taking you time into reading my story of gameplay of rust.",Rust

2017-07-13,0,0,7,True,Not Recommended,"The concept is interesting while not outlandish the graphics are fairly impressive for that type of game and the crafting system is pretty good. The only thing I'd say is bad in the game itself apart from the lag which may be fixed later on is the emphasis on finding food. I think it is both unrealistic and rather difficult to die so quickly of hunger when you have just eaten a whole boar by yourself. What really made me drop a bad review is something that cannot be fixed the community. People will kill you for absolutly no reason. It is just KOS every where. You'd think maybe it's to get ressources or something but most of the time they just snipe you from afar while all you buttnacked are carrrying is a rock. I've tried talking to them i've tried going to low pop servers i tried running (very uneffective unsurprisingly considering they are aiming at you with a riffle). I know i dont have a lot of hours on this game. But in 7 hours i've only been able to build a house once (and by house i mean three walls and a roof. So to conclude the game is OK (nothing mindblowing) but the player base is so counterproductive that it will ruin the game for you.P.S. dont believe reviews that diminish that fact by saying stuff like ""that's life"" or ""not everyone can be nice"". this goes beyond nice or mean people will shoot you for just being there chopping down a tree.",Rust

2016-08-14,0,0,357,True,Not Recommended,Been watching the game from a distance for awhile not 100% interested in purchasing the game. Just recently saw it in a online package with other survival games so I pulled the trigger and got it. Installed the game and loaded into a low population server since I have no idea how to do anything and some of the videos I have seen was brutal. First impression...my god this game looks amazing. It runs smooth looks great and I was ready to get into it. Opened inventory saw I was a female so I look around to switch myself to a male character and found nothing. Do a quick google search and saw all the news about random race/gender locked to your SteamID. Uninstalled Rust.This is of course my own opinion on it and as stubborn or bullheaded as it may be...when I play a game such as Rust where it is open world and you put time into building a character in this world I myself just enjoy playing as a male character since I am male. I understand female have played the game for a long time with the only option of having to play as a male character. Well the game is still in development and of course adding a female is the correct choice to give that option I applaud that and same goes for race. But to completely remove the choice to just switch to the gender/race is stupid and basically did ruin it for me. Does wee little old me have any impact of uninstalling the game...nope. But it is my review and this very random development choice was enough for me to stay away.,Rust

2015-07-19,0,0,585,True,Not Recommended,This is one mans opinion. The twig build up is okay but i would rather it be just ladders otherwise offline raiding is 100% garunteed. I don't even know how many bases i have lost due to this update it simply makes the game unplayable. YES i get it get auto turrets well not everyone has the time to put in to get an auto turret when building their bases not everyone has 12 other players to play with and not everyone enjoys playng with more than 2 ppl. Myself i enjoy duo/trio style playthroughs but you cannot succeed when every time you log back on your base is clean or wiped.I love this game and i play it everyday i know its pre alpha or whatever and things will change so another chance it gets from me but i will not keep playing if this update doens't get fixed.Again this is my opinion and i do not mean to call the game down just for me.,Rust

Not kidding you will have with luck 20 fps maximum and really bad graphisms with and freeze every 5 second for a survival game where you have to be focus and competitive as much as you can it's really a not serious work. Oh i forgot every updates they do going you're pc more uneficient so it's going more bad with the time. Better go play cs go or something else don't spend you're money on this game. At the beggining the mac version was correct but now i get the impression they just don't care. They are making dying the game by themelve. They promised car in the game since 6 months 1 year but it's not already do. lot's of use bug are going to make the game really raging for you and you will find at least one per update. For exemple one time they made bad the code lock and if you make a code with a special tricks you can unlock the code lock without have it. You can go on rock with glitch to be untouchable and unseeable. But if you are on you see guys on the other side and you can shoot on them without any risks because he can't see or hurt you as longer you are on the rock. WHAT A REALISTIC AND SURVIVAL GAME!,Rust
2017-12-26,0,0,7,False,Not Recommended,This game sure is something and it that something isn't good. A community more toxic than League of Legends censoring that is 10x worse than Saints Row and the beginning feels like I'm playing a Minecraft clone that is somehow worse than Minecraft itself. My cycle Spawn hit tree with rock hit rock with rock build foundation then got shot by some guy with an auto and full metal armor or die to 3 asian guys with spears to last a lifetime. One time I was lucky enough to find a friendly guy and we took this decent base without walls from two sleeping guys. Claimed it and started feeding it resources so it wouldn't decay. We gave it sturdy walls built a lot of weapons and armor plus we were near a really good resource area. Log back on 15 hours later and I don't spawn in the house. I run back to the exact same location but there was absolutely nothing there except for the house that was outside our that was worse and two bonfires right next to our house that were there before hand. Everything was wiped even though it wasn't a server wipe day. Never found the friendly guy again.For a game that just left early access this feels like the 2 dollar trash that you find on the Xbox Live Marketplace for the Xbox 360. This is such an awful game. I do not recommend ANYONE to buy this disgrace of a survival game. Just buy ARK when it finally goes under $20 so it isn't as much of a scam.P.S. I find it fantastic how the dedicated server that I did this all on says you will be banned if you are being extremely toxic and/or racist but the chat was just filled to the brim with edgy racist remarks about asians and black people along with the few sexist remarks. Nice work admins on keeping peace in a game that is founded on two things killing people before they have a chance of getting anywhere and toxicity that rivals League of Legends.,Rust

2018-06-14,0,0,51,False,Not Recommended,DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. This game is garbage. Actual garbage. The community is insanely toxic constantly flooding the chat with insults to no end and people deliberately kill you as a naked (You spawn as a naked) even if they know you have NOTHING. You CANNOT defend yourself against anyone with a gun within the first 3 hours of playing. no server has less than 40 people and usually alot of them are people who join at the very beginning of a server reset which means they get all of the great like ak47's street sign armor hazmat suits armored bases and an incredibly high ego. (not everyone but 90% of them) If you die the killer taunts you and calls you while rubbing his in your face. There is NO WAY to get good in this game without the help of atleast 3 other people with you. And everytime you complain about the facts of this game being a troll encouraging ripoff? People tell you that its because you're garbage at the game. How is having nothing but a wooden spear being alive for 3 minutes and getting killed by 3 people with bone armor crossbows and eoka pistols not being good at the game? Everytime you trust anyone you dont know they murder you. Its facts. This game should be at most 10 dollars and in early access. Not 35 ing dollars. waste of money yet i gave it too much of a chance to be able to refund it.,Rust

(take in mind I know this is alpha how ever I choose to include bugs as this is a payed for game and Im entitled to an opinion) performance bugs (gamebreaking) cheaters (from esp to aimbot to recoil negating) toxic people (sweaty or just plain annoying) update choices. I know im going to get A TON OF ""its alphaaaaa akdnfng"" so let me say this alpha requires good update choices to be made into a good game WITH OUT PERFORMANCE BUGS that is the main issue here jesus check some subreddits and other forums Facepunch LOOK AT WHAT WE ARE DEALING WITH. Frankly I'm sorry but no one gives a about your wires because we cant wire together when we are half way through the wall going from 80fps 13fps crashing the game in a span of 6 seconds!

I've feel this game has decided to optimize pretty graphics over the ability to actually load the game. And since you start from scratch each time you play the game that equates to a large steaming pile of unplayable.

There are reports of aimbots and admin abuse to add to the chaos.It will be a good game when it's finished and we're all waiting to see what features are added to expand the possibilities.

Hackers running wild (aimbots killbots ect.) constant kill on site BS spend hours farming and building just to log back in and find ""EVERTHING"" gone never mind the fact that even though you log out your body is still there to be looted and killed. Now you or the stuff you worked your but off to get is safe ever. I like this type of game but I can only start over so many time before it just gets stupid. Now coming back after 6+ months to see to new rust is broken beyond what legacy rust ever was.... I think the devs have taken 1 step forward and about 1000000 back. this is turning into nothing more then a permanent early access alpha than will run out of cash to back it before it is ever completed in any playable state never mind that most of the community has vanished. This is a joke of a game shame I can't get my cash back. Updated Ok so decided to give this another shot. Came back to see a rather long list of updates and pretty often too to my surprise knowing Gary's track record with broken half arsed games. Rust is shaping up to be a pretty good game.

(You can do that to!) Sure you'll see a variety mix of players with different agenda. Some just want to cook your man flesh (or lady flesh) so be wary of spur of the moment cookout requests! As mostly a solo player it can have challenges that makes you re think if alone time is healthy for RUST! Find some cool players start up your own clan or join a an existing one and go to war with the neighbors or stalk your foes through the forests over very tall mountains and probably freeze to death in the process... haha! Where else can you hone your bullet deflecting skills with your trusty rock! (Yes it can be done) There are a ton of plans to learn from the blue print (BP) system which is pretty cool. I can only imagine what options may come available once the xp system is hashed out and released to the masses. While there are some quirks and ongoing fixes it looks feels and plays really well compared to some released products out there today! Give it a try try harder when you fail (and you will... many many times!) and try to keep a level mind that yes you will meet griefers bullies cry babies and the occassional racial slurs (which usually gets players banned from private servers) but the chaos and fun is well worth the head aches!,Rust

2015-10-24,0,0,22,True,Recommended,"Though Rust is a game in early access it is a very good game amoung it's genre.If you've played ARK before then I can tell you that Rust has much better graphic optimization. (I've played ARK for over 800 hours so you don't need to ask me about how I made the comparison.)However before you buy this game keep this in mind Rust is an open world multiplayer game with servers hosted by both the official and players from the Rust community. Which means that there are griefers new player unfriendly as*holes scavengers raiders and PVP enthusiasts here in some servers. And these people are the main reason to define Rust as a survival game.So if you prefer soloing multiplayer games like ARK avoid Rust. That's because Rust is mainly a PVP game and a pvp game like this usually means that you have to group with others. Otherwise you may learn the definition of the word ""heartbreaker"". What may break your heart is not the game itself but people.However if you are going to group up with some friends and play together then the situation won't be too hash for you guys. Just build your stronghold (though I doubt that you can find somewhere large enough for a stronghold in a heavily populated server) and raid those poor solo players and enjoy the feeling of dominating. The building mechanics in this game is similar to ARK's (snapping of course) but more flexible and realistic than ARK. Though both Rust and ARK are flawed. Guess that's what a game in EA phase should be.",Rust

2016-07-10,0,0,42,True,Not Recommended,I have a feeling a lot of these positive reviews are paid or otherwise not honest... I've yet to actually meet anyone who has played Rust and really enjoyed it.Server 1 5 deaths (197/200 population) No rocks trees or food anywhere after multiple deaths/ganks. Literally couldn't do anything.Server 2 3 deaths (86/100 population) A few trees no rocks 2 mushrooms. Ended up starving twice cause no animals or food anywhere to be found. One death trying to kill the only animal we could find a Bear which 1 shots you when naked.Server 3 2 deaths (7/100 population) Plenty of trees rocks are still harder to find no rood or animals anywhere we could find. Died both times from starvation which takes a while but shows how long we ran around looking for stuff...Server 4 4 deaths Forget the poluation but this server you spawned with gear / weapons. The combat was horrible compared to real games like CS Overwatch TFC TF2 etc. As a pure combat game this is garbage.TL DR Game is crap. Graphics aren't great compared to other modern games. Resources are scarce or non existant on high population servers making it impossible to actually play. Because there isn't anything to do besides kill each other thats all players do... gank each other over and over.,Rust

2016-03-19,0,0,138,True,Not Recommended,"Here what this game has become *You enter a server you wake up(sometimes you die even you dont have time to wake up(!)) if you are in official servers prepare to die in 20 seconds without any reason if you can last 1 minute you are the king.Sadly the idea of a survival game sounds really cool and realistic.. but come on is this realistic? You die when you see someone without being in an interaction with him/her? This will always be the lack of survival games any game out there. Because there are some ing 10 years old kids or teens adults who have 10 years old kid's brain think these games as a ""Deathmatch"" thing. Yes of course you will fight with people to live but killing people without even a reason is unacceptable. Then survival type of games are not your kind. Go ing play Deathmatch. People buy these kind of games with a great hope to live the survival experience but the moment he enters the game someone sticks a spear in his The old Rust was very awesome. When there were radiated animals(like the orange bear for example) or zombies people were more friendly. I met 2 guys who were really nice and we built some base from scratch without getting interrupted by other people and fought with other strong groups of people.I think this game's community becomes more savage everyday.... So my opinion is don't buy this game..Go play ARK if you want something more close to survival.. Because even you play it on PvE you have to survive against Dinosaurs. In today's Rust??? You need to survive against a wolf and a bear which till this day from the new Rust's launch i saw them only 10 times.",Rust

2017-03-23,0,0,11,True,Not Recommended,This is literaly the worst game I have ever played.when you boot up the game it takes roughly 5 mins and joining a server is around 8. when you get in the game the lag is unreal. the graphics aren't bad on ultra but you need a beast of a pc to run the game like that with more than 10 fps. when you finally get in a server you are a) killed instantly by an overpowered player b) wondering through the woods for 5 hours looking for food until you starve to death or c) looking for your friend for 8 hours until you die via a spear to the face. if your friend spawns you at his base or you somehow manage to survive for more than 2 seconds you are stuck in a cave searching for food looking for wepons or being shot for the rest of your life. if you play for 2 million years you can build up a pretty nice base and watch it be destroyed by a clan of people with rocket launchers. Die. Repeat. that's the whole game. there is nothing else to do no where to go no objective in sight except not being instantly killed. If you somehow manage to join one of the massive clans then your life is raiding bases that are either empty already raided or armed to the teeth with defence systems. You cant spend 8 years building the best base ever either because the servers reset every couple weeks. everything you might have built in that time will be completly erased and there is no way to stop it. The crafting system is horrible too. you have to get literally thousands of resources press a button wait 5 minutres. and it'l poof into your inventory. I may not be the biggest survivle games fan but I can't see why anyone can enjoy this game.,Rust

2014-10-03,0,0,6,True,Recommended,"I played this game for a few hours and if you say i should not make a review just now but i am This game is not hard to learn after a few hours of gameplay.When i first joined a server i randomly got killed by a bear when i spawned 11/10Got chased by a naked man 11/10Got chased by 2 bears 2 wolfs and they even chase you while you go into the water!! loolWhen your getting chased by loads of people your heart will race and you give everything to get away xDBest parts of the game on what i think.You can make friends and build a house and share your things with them Your like a little family 3You can get guns in the game when really trying for one.You can hunt bears/hogs and wolfs and yes dont fight them with your crap stone You will just get eatten by the bear xD Rob people houses is great fun You hit there walls for ages and the walls come open and you walk in and rob there stuff and they come and start flaming in the chat xDYou can stay underwater without dieing 12/10The cons of the game right now I know its not fully finished.When you die you loss everything you spent hours working for You name it Wood stone Guns Hammers arrows Your tools for building your house.The animals are glitched or bugged When you hit them it does not hurt them and they kill you and most of the time they stand there and let you kill it.The stone you get when you spawn is garbage useless and slow Takes you over 5 mins to take a tree down or a rock.Some of the trees are glitched or bugged When you hit them with something and it gets upto 1000 the tree disappears in thin air lol.Lack of animals Its very rare to find any animals in the wild to kill and lack of stones You have to go to parts of the map to get what your looking for like stone or animals.Bad FPS drops when walking in huge bits of the map I get jumps of lag there and then I should be able to play this game on high without lag.Lacks of stuff in the game like more tools and weapons You should be rewarded for staying alive and working hard for your stuff.I think the beanbags are bugged. I think its called that anyway xD.When you die or get killed you randomly get spawned in the middle of nowhere and when you was with a friend its impossiable to find them again Its all about luck if you walk into them again You should be able to spawn right next to them or by there house.Most important of the whole game NO MAP! I was really sad that there was no map You should be able to mark where you was and get to there I always get lost when i die and i cant find my friend again.You swin like a granny Really slow.We want more hunting gear!The jumping bug.... You can jump over people's walls and rob them and even kill them! xDWhen you kill someone you cant take there stuff I think this should happen!!!!No water in the game The food gives you water ... errr wtf.Got 2 crashes while i had my stuff i worked hard for and when i logged back in it said ""Your dead"" I was so mad i gave up for today lol.Im not having a go because its unfinished but there is no bloody map!I think this game will be a great game and wouldnt recommand right now I would wait untill its better with a map.but would recommand when finished It will be a great game.Why did i want a game like this? I really wanted to try a game like this and enjoyed it It was boring on your own but when you meet people who are not noobs its really fun and could play for days on end )Thanks for a great game 8/10",Rust

2016-06-19,0,0,12,True,Not Recommended,The loading times are insane constant connectivity issues ONLY with this game. Video lag even when set at level 2 graphic settings. The devs also made it so if your steam account sais your a male you can only play female vice versa.. they claim its not intentional but that is complete lol. Overall gameplay is pretty terrible compared to other games. Constantly buggy and is ridilled with hacks and exploits that the community loves to take advantage of. This game is 100% not a buy. I was very fair in my review of this game given I attempted to give it every benefit of the doubt and play it for a bit. I very much enjoyed the idea of forraging for materials and building a mega base in the middle of nowhere but beyond that this game has little to please its players.The constant updates are EXTREMELY dumb and pointless. They remove features every update rather than add features eg the ability to turn off grass mesh to reduce video lag. I feel like the idea of Rust as a game is a good one but the developement team surely has little to no experience and dont seem to care for their players opinions. If you want to play a game that forces its feminist agenda down your throat while constantly updating a game to remove basic features and ignores hackers who use things like God mode and infinit ammo then this is the game for you! Terrible Terrible Game.PS the ability to pick your gender was one of those features they removed.,Rust

See another player boom you die see a bear you die see a wolf you die see a helocopter you die all the food and water stolen you die no wood no house you die. The game needs to have tree's regrow or put zombies back in and towns..... towns where the only place to find supplys welp gg now there being camped. The game is only gonna be fixed if the creators of the game fix the anti cheat. Dont play unless you have your own server cuz your never gonna get anywhere unless you've got guns or a group of people.Waste of money waste of time people can offline raid you who the hell though that was a good idea swear to god devs are even games like unturned are more updated and less laggy. verydisapointed that i even paid a dime for this.,Rust
2016-12-20,0,0,142,True,Recommended,Really fun game with plenty todo and a good crafting system though don't expect your base to last long if you ever log out as offline raiding seems to the favoured method amongst the populose of this game instead of actual PVP.

There will be update you disapprove of here and there but the developers actually care about the game. If something is wrong the developers will be there to fix it. I've had some of the most hilarious and intense experiences in this game e.g building a base and locking the door while getting shot at by 3 people that are actually inside the base... I still find this game satisfying to every extent. Shooting someone killing someone looting people raiding. This game is even MORE fun with friends. (dont go out there in 8 man squads tho pls) This game becomes double the fun when there's someone by your side you can experience it with.Buy Rust. It is well worth the money.

2016-05-25,1,1,0,True,Not Recommended,Steam gave us a gift. That gift is the ability to refund terrible games. Here is my story.You spawn in naked on a beach with a bunch of other naked guys. You get shot nearly instantly from one of the large bases near the beach. You respawn on a different beach and make it to the woods. You weren't killed this time! But someone elses spawns on that beach and beats you to death with a rock. After about 20 minutes of dieing constantly you finally get far enough from that damn beach to start doing stuff. You build a bow and some arrows. You find some food and hunt some game. Then out of ing no where comes a bear. You bows doesn't do crap against the bear. You get slaughtered by the bear. Then you respawn on that beach. You realize that you've only spent 1 hour and 59 minutes on the game. You quickly get off the game and go to steam support. You refund the game. You turn back your clock 2 hours and act like you never wasted you time playing Rust. Go play anything but Rust. You will die from everything. But when you think you've survived you'll die from a ninja bear attack or maybe cancer. Rust always has a way of making you die rage and refund.,Rust

Only a rock 2 bandages (which do nothing) and a torch.You use the rock on trees and boulders to get materials. You then can craft stuff.And then you get gang banged by 20 red wolves and red bears and eventually get shot by some setting you back all the way from the beginning. It's like purgatory. It never ends.Music Ha! You wish! All of it sounds like ambient and is barely worth listening to.Multiplayer Is all you got. No singleplayer. You have a choice of 3 kinds of servers Official modded and community. All ofwhich are probably going to have at least 3 4 hackers on. Oh and when the video says ""Make friends!"" You're notgoing to. And if you do its either your friends or a 10 year old pre pubescent boy who is tired of getting killed. LikeI am of this game. You're probably thinking ""Oh its in alpha!

2016-09-12,0,0,700,True,Recommended,Rust Is My Favourite GameSo when I originally bought this game I really didn't understand how to play it so it pretty much just sat in my library untouched. After about a year I decided to learn to play although with no help from the toxic community I learned from my friend who has a few hundred hours put in. It wasn't easy at first and learning to build a pretty well fortified base it took time. 3 weeks ago I had barely 20 mins played. To this day I have almost hit 100 hrs.Here are some things I've learned Base building takes time to perfect get on a server that does full wipes every few weeks and learn from your mistakes each wipe. People are s if they think you have useful gear they will kill you. Get thick skin! people will kill you take your stuff and then wait for you to come back to kill you again. Learn from people not everyone is an some are looking for people to join up with. Power is in numbers clans are big in Rust though they do have solo servers. Finally the game is in Alpha it's not perfect. If you're having trouble with FPS drops try lowering your settings quality its not your graphics card it's the game.

I've had a lot of fun with this online rock bashing gun blasting shack invading game. However it hasn't been without many of frustration and it hasn't been without it's rough patches.The bad moments in this game were most certainly caused by the hackers and cheaters who continue to run rampant and they have since this game went live on Steam back in December 2013. There is a lot of immaturity and griefing as well but I can handle the griefing as long as everything else is on a level playing field.I give Facepunch studios who made this game all the credit however as they are currently working on an entirely new build of rust to make it bigger better and hopefully able to stop hackers and cheaters much better as well. They said they never expected this game to grow to anywhere close to the popularity levels it quickly reached and now they are re building it better then ever to adjust. The good thing is that the $19.99 USD charge gets you both versions that will be kept online seperately. You're not going to have to fork out new money or any upgrade fee to get into Rust 2.0 when it officially launches very likely before the end of 2014.This game reveals the true nature of people trying to survive in a land without rules and law. It's a true survival of the fittest type of game and every man for himself.My best advice when playing... Fend for yourself. Don't be afriad to run and/or hide when you need to. And Trust Noone.This game is epic fun and the most fun I've had with a game in the past 10 years. It's truly a shame that some people have to go to all ends to buy or aquire illegal hacks and cheats to get an unfair advantage over other players and ruin the playing experience for so many others. We can all hope that Rust 2.0 can reduce these lame ducks in the game and make it an enjoyable rock war festival for all. )",Rust

Eventually some naked african man will find you and kill you.Oh yeah you can hunt a few animals and gather their meat in order to eat. Rinse and repeat. Big whoop never saw that in a game.

I know some people don't care but i want to be more immersed. simple as that. i've brought this up and of course the rust community being as toxic as it it only attacks you and tries calling you names for wanting a VERY basic function added. The devs also don't give two apparently since so many other people want the same thing. My initial complaint was not being able to choose your gender/appearance which i could have gotten over but since looking into the discussions and things about it i've really noticed how completely toxic the community is and how little the devs care about the community. please stay away from facepunch studios.,Rust

Your time will be utterly wasted.Build a fort and then get killed because of someone with a wall/aimbot hack or someone glitching their way into your fort watch them loot all your stuff and force you to basically start over again.

Like not allowing you to free roam cannot start a new game or character doesn't tell what what area is best for you or for this game you arent allowed to play singleplayer. I am alright with those MMO games where you can go off and do what you want on your own. I absolutely hate games that have ""servers"" like hello I like playing the way i want not the way you force. Like DayZ you need to be on a server these are both games i hate cause they force a certain way of playing on you without saying so when you buy it. When it says Multiplayer I'm thinking you log in and start playing with a bunch of people you may or may not know. But games like this say multiplayer when they actually mean ""Pay us money now go find a server made by someone you may or may not know and play on it. Singleplayer that is funny. You expect us the game creators and company to make a different mode for this game so more people can have fun? Thats too much effort we force the players to make the servers themselves."" this is what i think of this ""multiplayer"" t game and other games that enforce these personal servers.

2018-05-30,0,0,0,False,Not Recommended,I heard this game was a lot like Ark... but they don't have it setup to play just with friends on your own servers. That is hella lame and boring. Why do I wanna load into a online world and get spawn killed none stop from people with guns in towers? I played for 20mins and died 8x with nothing. The graphics are pretty lame and so is the building from as much as I could see in my 20mins of playing and dying none stop.I would give this game a 2.5/10If they ever get a single player server setup going then maybe I will revisit this game.Ark is soooo much bettter. Nobody can say Ark copied Rust. More like they left rust in the dust.,Rust

Read the review understood it's early access I play other early access games that are similar so knew things might be rough around the edges. Started my first game took more than a minute to load the map but I was still excited. I was in the world for a matter of moments game crashed. Loaded the game back up same loading time started my second game. When I finally spawned in my character someone had killed me before I could even take control of him. Third time loaded the game walked for about a minute and someone ran up and shot me. Fourthe time Psyche. I applied for a refund.,Rust

We found place we could build up and rob them.&gt Some guys started to shoot our base with rockets. We had only pistols. Now we have rocket launcher some AK's and Bolts. &gt We forgot to destroy enemy outdoor tool cupboard near our base and they started to build up a raid house near us. We kill them took their weps and blew up wall to destroy tool cupboard. Near cupboard we found a chest. Now we have 3 rocket launchers and 40+ rockets taken from that chest.&gt Somebody was raiding a house nearby. I dress naked and ran to look what's up. Spot a guy far running and then just dropping down (exits a game). I ran to him and stole his whole gear and after succesfully returting to our base.&gt (Happened alot of times) Somebody is raiding nearby (or notso nearby). We gather as team and run onto somebody's house rescure. Now we have tons of Rockets C4s Chests for every single weapon fully filled with them 10+ chests of armor gear alot of resources. &gt Suddenly after 2 weeks from last wipe server online drops from 100+ to avg. 10 people online. &gt Giving our house door pass in public chat. Changing server The Mighty Loop continues.In the end i want to clearify. Was a Rust player before experimental became actual game and old Rust became Legacy. The game heavely changed since experimental was open alpha. And it's changing step by step every week. Game sadly is not so optimized for me yet I am able to see average of 45 fps on my old timer PC. Devs are trying go solve problems players encounter and also they add stuff. Alot was changed and personally I like fresh new experimental alot more than crappy old Legacy where every weapon looks like m16 without a clip and red zombie bears dropping food meds and c4 recipies.. The list can go on and on. Would i recommend? Only if you have friends to play it with. Else what it's a hardcore mode to survive solo.,Rust

ARK has waaaaay more features but all clunkily implemented. Conan is years away from competing. H1Z1's been stillborn since launch (in survival not KOTH). These devs are experimenting with what's fun. If it aint fun they scrap it entirely they don't try to hack it in and make it fun and add onto the pile of crap. They care about keeping out the busywork that other survival games pride themselves in. They focus on all issues instead of freaking out and going all performance optimization this month and features next month and so on and so on. Take notes other devs.,Rust

2017-05-11,0,0,10,True,Recommended,DISCLAIMER This is a first impressions review and NOT a full review PLEASE NOTE This review is/was written when this game was in/is still in Early Access. Think twice before buying/playing this game Rust is a game developed and published by Facepunch Studios the same people behind the sandbox game GModRust can be a very fun survivial game especially with friends which I don't have. It can sometimes feel very slow pace on the official servers so If you want to quickly build and join in on the action I'd suggest a modded server with faster crafting and gatheringThe good things about Rust are that players can host their own servers off of their computers for free or pay to have it hosted on a local server. Rust offers an intricate and fun base building system. The hunting/gathering portion is fun and Rust offers a day/night cycle with an ever changing weather systemThe game is moddable with frequent updates and development blogs. The game offers a procedural generated world which gives you a sense of paranoia and generated biomes which include desert snow and grassHowever Rust has loads of issues in its current state. The game tends to lag if too many people are connected to the server and uses a lot of RAM with framerate and crashing issues. Rust surprisingly runs on the Unity engine making it not the best for optimization but the development team is managing to fix it and also animals don't follow rules of physics such us running up walls if they feel like itOne thing I absolutely hate in Rust is the sleeper servers. Even when you log off you are still in game and able to be killed. Pretty much forces you put in time to build a stable base before leaving the server or risk being killed which takes time and patienceOverall if you have the money I'd suggest looking into buying this game. It is currently in Alpha so really look into it before purchasing. However I wouldn't whole heartdly recommend it in its current state RECOMMENDED ),Rust

2019-01-13,0,0,208,False,Not Recommended,It's a waste of money only get it if its on an extreme sale or if you get it for free i'm already in the process of trying to get a refund. You thoguht bleach was toxic wait till you see the player base. not only that but you cant even get past wipe day without raging also the game tends to crash or stop responding way more frequently than any game should. The loading is also pretty insane it takes me abbout an hour to even get past the loading screen. Basically buy something better like Arma 3 for example or Rainbow Six Siege or literally any other game. Just don't buy ARK I've been told it has the same exact problems.

As usual they have found all sorts of ways of ruining games for fun. Current favorite seems to be spamming servers with tool cabinets inside small fortified boxes that block any other players from building within a 50m radius making games effectively unplayable on official servers unless you're a pal of one of the griefers. Admins are non existant and nothing is done to deal with this issue.Community servers are even worse with little or no matterials available and entire areas walled off so only a select few can loot. Modded servers are right out.Definitely not worth the $20 for this ""survival"" knockoff.",Rust

I Hate that you can not customize your base character. The least the devs could do is allow for a 3 setting switch (Random Female Male) But no they force a random unchangeable appearance and gender on you. It's not like it's a hard block of code to write.For those who have issues with ham fisted dev actions like forcing a randomly generated character on you in a role play environment I highly recommend you avoid this game.Edit Requested refund on this game.,Rust

Dosent feel as fun and fresh as it used to and has turned into so much of a grind fest if you cant play multiple hours EVERY single day its not for you. This game FORCES you to come on every day in order to do good and the game has a different feel when forced to go on and play. If your solo the experiance just gets even worse as larger groups will destroy you and there is basically no way to really beat them. Rust is no where close to how fun it used to be its over complicated with stuff that dosent belong in the game such as electrcity and vehicles it becomes a chore to play everyday just to survive over all this game is not worth buying anymore and playing it is even more of a punishment with every update.

EU RUST PRO Trader Zones Clan Markers X5 X10 Wiped 11/02Welcome all RUST PRO is a brand new server looking to deliver the best rust experiance out there in the modded community RUST PRO has been developed from the ground up and has been through vigorous testing and is now ready for launch. We have compiled a vast selection of mods and features on RUST PRO including trader zones Multiple Safe Zones are situated throughout the map allowing them to water up trade or even sleep over night for any weary travelers. The leveling system is also in place with a cap of 100 that when maxed out will grant you the X5 gather rate starting gather rate is X1. Airstrikes are available to buy when desired but this is nothing a fresh spawn can do you must work your way up to do such a thing! After each map wipe we offer to players the ability in which to copy their base to place on the next restart too this must be requested though of course. Bouties are in the server for those hated players within the server and there is also an official trade function for those who are respected in the server also its nice to have the trade function too as im sure the last thing you want is to be screwed over another advantage over the safe zones. Entering them will likely be a challenge though as tp's or even building in these areas will be prohibited. The cupboards also are not the vanilla ones they are in a sphere shape protecting you from all angles but of course no bases are unraidable!Backpacks will be available to players along with Sign artist instacraft quicksmelt Better Loot Clans Enhanced Hammer Fishing friendly Fire Private Message Events Active Admins and much much more!Our aim at RUST PRO is to give everyone a classic yet unique experiance and with an array of experianced admins to help anyone in need this server is brand new but has had great feedback from the start. We are also offering reward packages (for a limited time) if you are bringing on any new players in the server just message an admin in game and we will be more than happy to help.Server details I.P 144.76.87.228 28216TeamSpeak I.P 185.70.11.84 10017We hope to see you soon!Kindest Regards,Rust

2014-06-12,1,2,2863,True,Recommended,This game is simply amazing. Although in alpha this game is remarkable the graphics are amazing and the way it runs is just brilliant. Rust is a survival game where you start with a 2 bandages a rock and a torch you then proceed to gather materials and make a house. As the game goes along it gets harder to make items which gives it a longer play time. The PvP aspect is amazing as a half naked man can run over a hill and demolish you which is pretty funny in my experience. I rate it 9/10 just as I feel the updates need to be a little faster.EDIT NEW RUSTThis game just gets better not only are the devs dedicated enough to rework the game completely they update it every week! The graphics are god like and the PvP is even better than before although a half naked man killing you usually involves a bow or a spear and you end up crying in a corner.

The game is crushed by hackers that force your character to suicide that noclip aimbot and even re configure your houses door lock. When you make a house and a door the door locks itself. Only you have the ""key"" to open said door. Hackers switch the owners on the doors to them and take everything you've worked for. This is every server. Even the official servers. Gary Newman and Steam are both working to get this issue resolved but it is not worth the hours of torment you'll endure trying to even get a foothold in this game. Even after that you get your things taken by both players and hackers. The community in this game treat it like a CoD crafting game. No matter what you have if you've even just started out people with great gear and equipment will gun you down with no second thought and taunt you about it non stop.

Now go look at the positive reviews look at the 190 hours played 125 hours played so on and so forth. LOL. Thats just it man you can play the entire game in an hour. All buildings are exactly the same all the guns are the same aside from damage (the FPS is very boring). But its still a little fun.. Then the hour is over. All you have aquired goes into your house. Then Mr 190 hours has enough C4 to raid EVERYONE on the server 100 times. He doesnt need your stuff he just raids you so you have fun... lol. Seriously this is how it goes on ever server. This isnt even a real game yet so all thats in it is griefing other players. AVOID. Dayz Standalone is just as good and has a better chance of getting fun more quickly.,Rust

If you don't have food like all of us do in the beginning don't bother to run and avoid walking as much as possible. Food is almost impossible to find in spawned buildings but also in the nature considering the fact that animals all glitch through walls making is impossible for you to kill them. I've timed it. You have about 20 minutes to play when you first connect. If you don't find food you'll yave to start again. A week ago I would've recommended the game.

2018-10-26,0,0,45,False,Not Recommended,You play this game as an naked man with a long stick that shoots bullets at angry naked women. Also if you pay more money you get to shoot hitler in the balls which is probably the best part. But im a poor man so I dont have that DLC.Anyway this game has a relatively short story about 0 hours. The maps are wonderfully decorated with ugly bases and a great grass level. The shooting mechanics are fun and it is very fun to be sneaky beaky. However there are no gold scars. Like wHAT THE F*** where are the devs in this game? SERIOUSLY? scars are the most important necessity for any poopy sniper! No scar means that this game has ABSOLUTELY ZERO HISTORICAL ACCURACY WHAT THE F***!!!!! I want scars in my video games. Other examples of good video games with scars 1.fortnite2. Pub G is clearly the best Battle Royale game on the market and I found a potato in it. But this game has no POTATOES and is a very bad battle royale. COINCIDENCE I THINK NOT!So to summarise the game is pretty ugly but I mean there aren't any scars which is the biggest letdown for sure.(NOT MY REVEIW BTW),Rust

You can be naked carrying a rock with no loot at all on you and someone with a gun will shoot you.If you enjoy playing the lone wolf or in small groups while interacting with human beings without necessarily having to kill everything that moves don't buy this game.This is a game for people who play in large groups that like to see what life would be like if we all devolved into animals. There is nothing social about the servers it is pure savagery. Ultimately this is a gauntlet run to get tech'd up to guns so that all the people killing newbies may actually pause and rethink as taking you on may be an even match up.A real shame the gameplay is awesome.,Rust

2018-07-04,0,0,11,False,Not Recommended,"Boulder Rootkit Simulator KYS 2015. Rust wants to be the ARK Island map but can't... It's the Unity engine client server game where different maps fail at many attempts to mimic the Unreal engine and ARK survival ultra graphic settings... Screenshots may look nice but gameplay isn't and servers drown themselves in clutter objects... 70% of the map content is the same gigantic 10 000 verticy boulder shrunk and glued thousands of different places across the many islands... I found a server called BARREN where all clutter objects have been removed. The amount of actual game content that isn't clutter is hillarious near 10%. The devs should rethink Rust quality settings and rebuild from ""potato"" up. Potato being said one must realize that these are abusive developers... An integrated Workshop feature frequently updates item data while playing. This feature manifests as malicious graphic performance stuttering. It updates workshop item lists that cause fragmentation across the system and game drive then ultimately these fragmented workshop item data files do slow read and write speeds durring gameplay.

If you manage to survive that you'll realise there's no rock nodes (this game's stone) and you can't actually create any other tools without it. So you're basically ed unless you search around the map. And it takes a long ing time to search.

2016-02-05,0,0,8,True,Not Recommended,Terrible community. Gameplay is awful. Entire aspect of the game where you unlock blueprints is rolled back every 2 weeks so you never actually have meanigful progress as a player. To top it off the developer is more in love with making dangling genitals and boobs visible for 12 year old boys to oogle than to actually make competent gunplay or combat that doesn't feel worse than minecraft.,Rust
2018-10-28,0,0,1,False,Not Recommended,"The game forces a random character onto you despite having full customization. Dev refuses to allow us to create a character because we will be ""more attached"" to this one. It's a stupid decision and I strongly disagree with their decision. I refuse to play and recommend a game that forces these types of arbitrary decisions. For the record I would play the game if I could create my character. I have androphobia (fear of men) and as such I do NOT play them in video games. Being assigned a male in this game means I refuse to play it or spend any more money on it.

2014-07-05,0,0,40,True,Recommended,Rust together with 7 Days to Die are at the moment the most unique games out there for the simple reason that you are getting minecraft in a real zombie apocalypse scenario and what I mean to say by that is that you can build virtually anything yes anything from a tower to a stadium of course you can also dig in 7 Days to Die but that's for another review. With an active and large community I can easily prefer this over DayZ any day there is a crafting system in the game storage/inventory one tho you gotta watch out for trust tho there are a lot of bandits in the game like in DayZ even whole raiding groups/parties and teams so I'd suggest you play the game with a friend on a low lag server with a friendly admin to kick or ban hackers/cheaters and use creative ways to defend your base and to make the the most raiding proof if not strongest one in the server because trust me it will come in handy even if you are not attacked on the 1st or 2nd day.,Rust

2015-04-12,0,0,736,True,Not Recommended,"So I have over 700 hours on this game as a MAC user so I'm not some new person writting a review. Let me start off by saying this. GARRY IS A SCAMMER. Sorry people but it's the truth. If you have a MAC do NOT buy this game. He is constantly breaking this game and not fixing the things that he breaks instead he just continues to add more content while leaving the MAC client broken. Now a patch goes wrong on the PC client and it's maybe an hour later then it's fixed. A patch goes wrong for the MAC client and we're still at three days and waiting for a patch to fix it. Said patches are game breaking to where you can't even play for five minutes before the game crashes or the game crashes as you just get into it. If you cannot see how game breaking this is well I'm sorry. Next let's go onto the useless updates. Instead of fixing said connection issue with the MAC client we instead get a patch that breaks the game and gives us guitars. Wooooo. You know that's what MAC users need a guiatar that we cannot play due to not being able to get inside of the game. Perfect. Right? So what are we at so far? You spending 20.00 for a game where a part of the userbase (MAC users) are left out of the support. So really what you are buying if you are a MAC user is another ""The Stomping Land."" There is no support or DEV team there and there is no support or DEV team here for MAC users. Do not buy this game if you use MAC. I will change this review when the game is stable for our kind again. Then adding MAC into the system list is just a CASH GRAB if you play this your going to be playing legacy not the newer version.",Rust

If you kill either you can take whatever they had on them. You can craft your own forge complete with doors windows. There are three different parts of the map. My only complaint was once you get killed by someone. You have to re start your entire wardrobe. If you had weapons ore it's all gone. You start from square one. It's pretty fun game once you get into it and its a work in progress. I'm sure once its finished. It will be even better.,Rust

New players are forced to join what is essentially a PvP server and start out naked on the beach while everyone else has already crafted semi automatics and high powered ammo. You are supposed to find firewood and build a fire while everyone else gets to kill others and rob their camps. The onscreen cues can't seem to decide if they want a keyboard or gamepad. The keybind screen shows everything but how to Use something which is apparently the most important button you have. Then it gets dark and you can't even see where any wood is because you couldn't even find it in the daylight. It took 20 minutes to load for me to play 5 of the most miserable minutes I have ever endured. All the while reading the toxic hatred thrown back and forth between stoner tags like monkeys throwing feces at the zoo.

Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9 inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate pour in apple slices.4. Roll out top crust into a 10 inch circle. Cut into 8 (1 inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips one at a time into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.5.

But these alpha survival games like micreated are just awful dire experiences.There's nothing good about them. You wander round in an almost comical setting.

2016-10-01,1,2,30,False,Not Recommended,Do you enjoy multiplayer only games? Where you can't even practice on your own experement or just build? Then this game is for you.I like to play around with the mechanics build large bases and explore. You can't do that in this with out dealing with many people shooting you in the back or camping spawn points and killing you just as you come into the game.Until there is an option to play single player in this game I can not recommned it.From what I have playes (when a friend was paying for a server) it was a nice game. I had fun building and finding/crafting items and just looking around/exploring.Graphics are nice and the game runs smoothly for me so no compaints there just the lack of a single player to go play around in when I don't want to deal with people.Update Seeing as how character look gender and race are now being decided for us I can not recommend this game at all. One of the aspects of these games is the ability to make a character your own the way you want it. This has been taken from user and replace with an algorithm leaving people with what they may not enjoy playing.If I could get a refund for this game I would. I have finaly regretted an Early Access Purchase. Updated for release Game on full release now and still no single player set up. Instead you need to have a dedicated server running on your system and then run the RUST game and connect.ARK seems a bit more thought out and user friendly to me in reguards to this aspect. At least there I can easily create a local game to play around and build things.,Rust

2015-12-28,0,0,265,True,Not Recommended,Great game has amazing potential but the devs rarely add anything new its just optimization and very small difrences that are barely noticable. my build is able to run BO3 on just about highest settings witch is pretty good but rust i can barely run on medium (Pretty) meaning the optimization is just teribble you will need a decent computer to run this on highest with a good 60 frames but since it is in alpha and has been for along time (another DAYZ) i will give it a good rating just a little upset about optimization.UPDATE Well this game is now garbage and i hive it a thumbs down now... they removed screen locking so if you have more than one monitor you cant play the GOD DAMN game so ing ennoying. and also yes they optimized the game better now but every time someone joins the game because of there stupid hack system that is even worse than VAC. so this game im going back to The Forest thank you facepunch you can go yourself.,Rust

What's best about this game is being with your friends. Six of us all roaming the beautiful landscape of Rust raising bases killing other gangs of savages. Developing our skills in combat and gaining the best gear. Base building we chose a builder for our crew and in no time we had a fully functional base which gave us somewhere to aboard an room to store our valuable gear. I strongly recommend this game especially if you an your friends are going to play it as well. It offers hours of fun. This game is in alpha so some things like some textures of some buildings haven't been done yet. However I'm expecting good things in the future. Buy this game now!,Rust

2015-07-05,0,0,25,True,Not Recommended,This game while it is very fun and addictive has severe problems for a survival game. Most games your gear will be saved when you get off in this game when you disconnect from a server your body is left sleeping on the ground which if you have a house would not be a problem. Unfortunately all it takes is for one person to run along break down your door and steal everything you have worked several hours for. Fun but not worth the hassle.Also the game is terribly optimized I get 60 fps on every other game but on this game there are frequent graphics errors and frame rate problems. This is the only negative review I have ever bothered placing because this game is almost a waste of time to play.,Rust

2014-09-23,0,0,33,True,Recommended,Well after playing Rust the Game I was very impressed with the idea as well as the graphics. As an old fan of Lego world of Minecraft this game places among the top with its ability to keep you entertained as well as struggling with environmental challenges. You must find/create clothing shelter and feed yourself. One if not all sometimes seems demanding. As you fight a bear with a rock no clothing and night fall is approaching!! Yet you still haven't acquired enough wood to begin a shelter. This game fantastic!I've also noticed like all games you tend to have some less than desirable players. But this comes as part of the world you are trying to build in. You are naked with a Rock and trying to survive. It IS survival of the fittest as well as the most equipped.The new Experimental version is even better with its graphics sound and immersive landscapes.I have just began both Rust and Steam and I can say now that I have High Hopes for the game of Rust although muddling through Steam's less than desirable layout is not fun but worth the pain. Good luck Rust This Rock is for you.Caleb CintaryDj of Pro Star Radiohttp //www.ProStarRadio.comTWITTER http //www.twitter.com/prostarradio,Rust

2014-09-24,0,0,1,True,Not Recommended,Rust seems fun when u can play. But be warned there are still many issues. one being that you can only play for ten to 20 minutes before an error message comes up about an expired ticket. I looked it up and found heaps of people having the same issue but no serious fix. The only fix being to completely uninstall steam and your games and reinstall them. So before you buy u may have to alot of sitting infront of the computer looking at installation screens. research before you buy. p.s. FIX IT!!!!!!!!!!!!! Once the problem is fixed it seems very fun.,Rust
2014-01-06,0,0,43,True,Recommended,I actually got lost in the wilderness and the skills I learned in Shack Simulator 2014 helped me survive. First I grabbed a medium sized rock and killed a wild boar then repeatedly beat the carcass with the rock until chicken breasts and cloth came out. I moved on to a tree and started slamming it with my rock. It didn't actually fall down but I gathered plenty of wood logs so I used them to make several shacks. I didn't actually use them for shelter or sleep though they were just for show.I came across a boulder and started slamming it with my rock which got me a bunch of metal. I used that metal to craft a door and built myself a house to call my own in the middle of my shack city. I cooked and ate my pig breasts so I wouldn't go hungry and crafted a complete sleeping bag including with zippers and a pillow from the cloth I got pulled off of the pig.As I was settling down for the night a bald Korean man materialized through my house's wall and shot me in the head instantly. He looted all of my things and destroyed my sleeping bag. Thankfully the bullet only grazed my skull and I lived to tell about it.I can tell you that if it wasn't for the survival skills I learned in this game I wouldn't be here today. 10/10.,Rust

2016-02-20,0,0,19,True,Not Recommended,On the plus side The crafting side of the game is awesome. The blueprint system is good. I like the fact that you don't forget the blueprints you've learned between server resets. However before you buy the game like other players have said The game is BRUTAL. Don't expect to survive long. Even as a naked man with nothing more than a rock and a torch you will be killed. The environment is dangerous though I've never been killed by anything in it. (Bears and wolves as well as the cold and starvation can kill you. I've just never lasted long enough for them to be trouble for me.)The PVP aspect is high. If you enjoy hardcore kill or be killed action then this game has it. If you do not enjoy that type of game don't put down the money. That is all this game is about.,Rust

2015-11-14,0,0,319,True,Recommended,"Rust is a good game with lots to do for everyone. I have seen people successfully play and ENJOY the game as many roles from carpenter farmer hunter/gatherer trader all the way to the extreme opposite as a Raider/PVPer. And don't listen to those who are giving negative reviews because of the community As with any game that has multiplayer where you deal with other ""real"" people there will be those who have issues playing nice (Thats just how people are if you havn't figured that out yet) and there are entire servers full of people who will do anything to make themselves feel empowered by killing anyone they see regardless of being able to defend themselves or just wanting to be left alone... Easily solution to this problem if its not your thing Move to a NEW SERVER! There are lots of decent servers out there as well with friendly communities who just want to be your friend and together build a brothel where you and everyone you just befriended can go do non violent things with each other and not worry about being hunted by another player. Like I said Rust has stuff for everyone sometimes you just have to find it. Overall good game that is regularly being updated and deffinantly worth picking up.",Rust

2017-03-18,0,0,839,True,Recommended,This game is great (to say the least.) I played this game for 12 hours straight after I got it. The only downside(s) are the random frame drops sometimes the game will crash upon startup and of course the people who won't give the poor little freshies a break... After countless times of being shot in the back by some one who has more experience and gear. It will start to take a toll on you especially if you even get lucky enough to grind yourself a base before getting domed by that 10 year old watching you from a distance with a semi auto rifle.I still haven't given up and I enjoy some encounters even though most just end up with me dead.

No matter how many times I play the game &amp or take a break. I always find myself coming back. With Weekly consistent updates. This game will teach you to accept L's and you better get use to it. No other game is more competitive then Rust imo. But when you win...you really do feel the win. Not to mention the adrenaline rush you get from this game....mannnnnnn its so addictive. If you're the type who can't stand to loose or get butt hurt easily..stay away. Just a fair warning.,Rust

2015-01-09,0,0,15,True,Not Recommended,I picked up this game right around when it came out and I would say it was very good for an early release game. There was not too many bugs to speak of and overall very playable. I just came back to it now after this whole new experimental sandbox hype and I got to say this game turned to a piece of I know that this aspect of the game is very new but the amount of bugs is just stupid. I joined an empty server with a friend to mess around and have a bit of fun. After we spent a good hour trying to find each other we got right off to smacking some trees with our big rock. After we got some resources we discovered that we need to kill animals to get cloth because that makes sense. Well Chasing a boar with a hatchet is fun if you want to run for a mile only having a chance of being able to hit it. My friend basically said F #$ this and we went after a bear. Well he died. I gathered up all his stuff and then after an hour he found me again. Great. Here is where the BS starts. When he gets back to where I am he asks for his hatchet back. I say fine let me go into my inventory... oh where did it go? I know I picked it up. Oh well here are the resources to make it. I drop them on the ground and he picks them up. He then proceeds to say where are they? Apparently you can't drop stuff and have others pick it up. Not sure if it is a server setting but this needs to not happen. Found that the only work around was to put items in a chest so that he could take them out. I finally get enough resources after multiple deaths to make this piece of crap pistol that basically doesn't work unless you are 3ft away from something. I get it and understand that the accuracy isn't great but at least give me some sort of hit indication on something. I gained a bit of confidence and went after a bear. I shot at him at first and was about 30ft away. I started to kite him and thought that this was easy. The bear then proceeded to do some form of a swipe with his claw from 40 feet away and I died. Left game....This game started well but this new experimental thing is such a piece of crap. I don't know how you can release something with this amount of bugs.,Rust

2016-07-13,0,0,217,True,Recommended,"Ah... This game benn hesitating to write a true review for Rust because of how unstable the community can be compared to how fluent and amazing the gameplay can be... So here it is. Rust where the description of the game that the devs wrote up only explains what the game could be and what it severely lacks of. Rust has always been the go to game for stable PvP fights because DayZ has that ""I hope I don't lag out while shooting this guy from 400 meters away"" feel many people left the game to transfer to Rust but since the game developers have been reiterating the gathering and crafting system into a blueprint system then a component system it makes it difficult for a solo player which yes I get that numbers make the experience easier therefore better but nothing can stop offline raids which is the nail in the coffin whenever my friends and I play rust in the big servers no clans want to raid you when you have defenses which really hits us all hard unfortunately with the way the community's mentality formed around ""kill or be killed"" and ""scumbag mentality wins over playing the game the way it is intended to be played"" no one will ever think to raid you online our clan is of 5 people all who get on relatively same time so we can enjoy roaming meeting people and shooting those guys who shoot at us. But we never get farther than the first three days before we get offlined. Now this is not to bash on the devs. They are great at updating this game and their future plans for Rust makes it such a promising game more so than any other game I can think of. But it's where the community forms from its public mentality that makes this game unplayable. If people like cruel and punishing gameplay then yes I strongly recommend this game to anyone to me however I like having a defense against offline raids tameable creatures or more ai controlled defenses like electric fences or robotic mechanisms! This is where I would like to see this game at until then I will stick to a server where the community would rather be that bit more friendlier and not shoot that guy who only has a Tshirt on or would og as far as to greeting you without guns to your face or at least not offline raid me the moment I go to bed.

2014-04-10,0,0,18,True,Not Recommended,New Review. Basically you spawn with a piece of rock and 3 health packs. Then you famirialize yerself with the game. Now it's time to chop some wood and you do so. Takes 30ish minutes to get a good amount for a hut and door. Then oh wait. what is that ?. A 8 year old on his mic aimbotting. Oh well. GG your dead now. Now repeat that 50 times and you'll be good. The game has massive potential. It's ruined by the amount of hackers and bandits. The hacking is worse than CSGO hacking and there's lots of hackers in CSGO MM. Stepping into Rust right now is like stepping into Hacker Hell.,Rust

You will do everything to stay alive and keep it. Now having said that this game is riddled with hackers and there isnt much being done about atm. Me and my team spent countless hrs farming materials and building just for a hacker to come and take it all. If that gets fixed. There will be no other game to play just rust.,Rust
2016-02-12,0,0,32,True,Not Recommended,I am pretty experienced with FPS and survival games. Despite that and 30 hours of my life spent TRYING to like this game it ended up just being a waste of over a day of my life I wished I could get back let alone money. No matter what you do someone that bought the game before you is going to get a rocket launcher and blow up everything you've spent hours building even if you have nothing of value for them to take. And then they walk away and you are at square one. Smashing a rock into trees is not fun anymore.This game needs more environmental interaction and it needs some form of reputation or consequesnce for killing or helping others among other things. Nether started out with promise and then tanked and this is not even as good as Nether was when that was in Beta.,Rust

I can see why they put restrictions on the building but I feel they went too far and took the fun out of it. I think the PVP is still fun but to me that was like quarter of the game. there are so many more pvp fps games out there that are better. wall stacking did make bases op but you cannot even put different shapes above or below each other anymore and just leavs holes in the base if you want to build a floor a different way then the one 2 floors below taking a lot of the building fun out of it. The upkeep system is just TRASH clans can not have an issue with this or just groups who can assign some tasks but agian solo duo people suffer yet agian! so the fun is sapped and beaten out of it it is just a grind pvp now making it boring and dull.I miss so many building options and base designes and what pisses me off is now the creativity is just sapped. ya dun messed up Facepunch Studios.,Rust

2014-10-10,0,0,1202,False,Recommended,This is a survival game with dynamics of farming/looting building crafting and shooting. You only need to do the first three to survive (farm build and craft). I first played this game when it was legacy and it was so much fun. It was a game where you can meet with people. There were bandits that everyone hated. And it was just so much fun. Now everybody is just killing each other. There is no farming no building creative bases but just killing. There is no sense of community unless you're playing with friends. Going han solo is a waste of time you're not going to survive. Geared guys killing nakeds. Nakeds killing nakeds too for some reason. It is no longer a playable game. That's why the player base has declined over the years. There has to be a change. And I'm not talking about those weekly updates. Something big. Something that would bring people together because survival games are about community. Don't get me wrong I love shooting and raiding etc. It's just the game is more than that. And people are ruining it. If you're playing alone By the second or third day every rad town and air drop will be dominated by clans. You have to farm hard. Looting is very difficult playing solo so do it at nights! Build your base somewhere close to recyclers. Lighthouse is a good spot because you can hear them when they swim to it. If you see a group of two or more run like hell!,Rust

I said fine I can make it look uglier so I turned friquin potato mode one scaled down resolution and I could scrape a stable 30 fps after several patches.Now that I would want to continue playing this game it came as a very big surprise that they updated the specs of the game. I tought it would not have been such a dramatical change.But it was! Sadly my rust experience went from stable 60fps down to 10fps (at best times) within a year please note that!What is the moral of this story you ask?

2016-06-16,0,0,45,True,Recommended,Pretty ok game. Everything is great. Kinda uncool how all animals can scale rocks immediatly. Only real problem is the players. People with absolutly nothing get slaughtered by people fully decked out. And the decked out people dont agro each other for fear of loosing their stuff. If you are lucky enough to get so far along and get all the gear you only go after freshspawns or people just getting started bc there is no threat. It really suck spending 30+min getting recources and then shot down by a person with an AK47 while you are still nude. Great Game Crappy players,Rust

2014-12-07,0,0,1406,True,Recommended,rsut is 1 of the best survival games out there wich isent a clone. unlike similer survival games like dayZthis is mroe focus on bases and raiding and materials it sounds lame but its not. another thing this game uses alot of time and i mean alot. this isent a casual game beacuse if u dont play within a certain time phrame everything u build gets deleted. this game is alot of fun and dosent get repetetive it can be anoying when u start but dont let that hold u back. the combat is very intense wich makes this game good. when u get something like a pistol or sniper rifle or a rifle theres no crosshair and theres seriously big reciol wich makes gun fights hard especilly when u only got 20 bullets left. there is hand to hand combat wich still is usefull so its not all about guns. this is also a game of trust and hostile people which u always hate and will raid u. since this is a multiplayer game u will find nice pople and hostile people who will make a base with u and then take all your belove loot from u. lastly this game is such a diffrent game than all the other survival games9.5/10now theres 2 diffrent rusts legacy wich i jsut reaveled and the new one wich im rating now.the new one has alot better graphics and has a more dayZ play style. there still is bases but u wont be in them for a while. the frame rate can be a bit dodgy but luckily recently they hadent settings to stop the bad framerates. nextly the new version is in beta big time so it changes alot. one reason y this is a little bit more dayz style is beacuse bases are alot easier to raid unlike the first game. next thing this game hasent been abandoned theres like an update each week wich takes 20 mins. gary newman (the maker of gmod) really keeps promising more in rust and he deliveres mroe and more without ruining the game or making a thing op. this is still in beta so dont judge straight away. i also jsut started doing the new rust so i havent gotten much im sure theres loads more ive missed. 9.7/10 rust legacy/new rust,Rust

2017-06-27,0,0,25,False,Not Recommended,the game itself is awesome but he community is cancer and you cant trust anyone who you don't see spawn in front of you to confirm that they aren't going to kill you on sight. the community is basically a bunch of trolls and cancerous players who will kill you just to see that you have nothing they want in your inventory and then leave you. the game itself is interesting and fun and a great idea thoughUpdate cant even get the game to run any more just stutters and fails to load when i try to enter a server so. as far as im concerned until they fix this this this is by far the game that has disappointed the most. with friends this is enjoyable but when you cant even get it started that basically goes against what i said before about how the game itself is fun. very disappointed.,Rust

2015-12-19,0,0,1628,False,Not Recommended,Used to be a good game. Now it's purely clan wars. If you plan on playing this solo good luck the grind is worse than most mobile games ever since they combined the blueprint and component system. If you have a group of buddies you're still going to have trouble because they don't wipe bps every month so people will have much quicker access to crafting higher tier weapons where they can easily camp and raid your base. I want to put a huge emphasis on the grind. All progress is locked to one server and you earn extremely minimal scrap from barrels (2 scrap per barrel and ONE level 3 bp costs 1000 scrap to research it let alone build it). The whole system is just completely in favor of groups. Not to mention while you are grinding the playerbase is extremely toxic and will shoot you on sight regardless of how geared you are. So there you go an endless cycle of farming to gain any relevant weapons in fights only to be killed on your farming trips constantly in what seems like an already endless grind as the costs for everything as so ridiculously high.

2014-12-16,0,0,94,True,Not Recommended,The game's mechanic is good I like the base building and the hunt mechanics this game offers. What I don t like is that players are most of the time. Armed players tend to go on killing new spawns and new spawns tend to pick on other new spawns to liberate the anger of being killed over and over again by this kind of players. It s sad that this game being this good has attracted the WORST possible kind of people and I hope the devs try to do something to stop this nonsense massacre because this isn t a survival game this is a basically a Call of Duty with crafting. This is so far the impression that the latest build of Rust has left me. 4/19/2015,Rust
2015-04-19,0,0,9,True,Not Recommended,This game has been in Alpha for about 18 months and there has been noticeable improvements.

2018-07-08,0,0,23,False,Recommended,I've had doubts about this game before I actually clicked on add to cart and eventually bought it. I've had doubts that I wouldn't have that much fun in this game considering how this game is built upon the idea of player interaction and less in the progression of your virtual character. I've had doubts that I would immediately get thrown into the chaos and beaten left and right.I'm so glad that I got past all those clouds upon learning that you can actually pick any server that you want to play in. I've had so much fun exploring the world without anyone's disturbance. If you're having doubts like I was you ARE in control of this game in the sense that you can always pick the loneliest server that pops up if you want to just chill and explore the world by yourself or the populated server whenever you feel like you're up for a challenge.The crafting system is not at all complicated. It is actually addictive despite its simplicity since the journey to obtain the materials is what makes the crafting system so satisfying. I love the fact that you actually have to actively take care of your base. It makes you feel like your adventure never ends up being a waste of time.I get it that you might feel intimidated by this game's possibility of being very toxic but remember you are in control of this and with that in mind you will not regret.,Rust

2017-05-27,0,0,412,False,Not Recommended,"Okay so I have put about 200 hours into Rust and I'm going to write another review once I get more hours. So I'm going to tell you my experinces in Rust and if its worth your hard earned 20 bucks. So my friend had gotten Rust because he was tired of all the games he had and after a couple of days he recommded it to me. And I was like sure why the hell not. And boom! One of my current favorite games was born. Rust can get be frustrating most of the time. You WILL spend hard work and effort to make your little shack and it WILL be wiped by a 8 man clan. Things like that will happen even more now that the ""Twig Foundation"" update is out. But Rust can be very satisfying as well. For example on one server this group of 3 raided my base and killed me. So in return I got allied with a group of well armed people and raided and took over their base in return. Getting revenge is in my opinion the best part of this game. The game in general needs a bit of time to get used too. Controling the spray of your gun can get hard sometimes. But keep in mind the goal of this game is too survive and become the most powerful player on the server (Well thats my goal atleast) and people will betray you. Trusting someone is always a risk (unless you know them irl) but trusting people might be better than just killing the right off the bat. Okay this review has gotten a bit too long so imma wrap things up. If your into games like ARK then this game will suit your needs. Playing alone is fun enough but with friends is even more fun. Couple words of advice don't trust strangers until you have formed some sort of a bond nighttime is aids stray clear of bears and wolves and eoka pistol is god tier.Part 2 So I've put in 100 more hours into rust. Not that much but enough has changed and I've experienced enough to come back to add to this review. As of this day Rust has lost its charm for me. Don't get me wrong I loved this game to death and I still reccomend it to a new player but fo me personally its lost its charm. Rust used to be burtal and unforgiving and still is to a extent but there are things they have done to make it less brutal. For example key locks. They used to be the bane of rust players on wipe day your scrambling around trying to find enough metal to make that code lock and GET RID OF THAT KEY LOCK. But not the key lock is basically a code lock for solo players. Boom. Instantly that whole aspect of fear and thrill is gone. Furthermore they have made rust into a grind. Now don't get me wrong I have nothing wrong with games that have grind (I love Warframe) but Rust is unessciarly grindy. The whole workbench/scrap thing while cool is uneccsary to me and I think that the component system was fine. I get that they made it like this to give a bit of an edge for solo and duo players against clans (I think) but its pointless dumb and puts to much weight on rng. For me these things along with others have not broke rust or made it bad but simply made it lose its charm. Do I still reccomend this game? Hell Yes. Although the price change was kinda wack I still think this game is worth it. Just have atleast one friend to play with. But for me rust has become something new and I'm not sure if I like it.(P.S) NIGHTIME IS A BIT BETTER YET STILL AIDSOkay Part 3 Recently they added in a new system into the game that I despiese. The ""Team System"". There is so much wrong with that I don't know where to start. Firstly this gets rid of you being able to pull off sneaky stuff. For example a common way people ask each other on discord or skype if thats their friend or not they say ""Jump Check"" then their friend starts to jump identyfing themselves. What some people did was whenever they saw someone they would jump JUST IN CASE they were saying ""Jump Check"" to a friend of them on a 3rd party voice chat system and then they would be pulled into a state of false calmness in which the person who isn't their friend would kill them to the person utter confusion. This can no longer happen. You know what else can't happen that well? Hiding in bushed for an ambush. And the biggest blow is now you can tell who is friend or foe in a big fight. Now some people probably like this but personally I think its stupid. Accidently killing your friend in a fire fight is quite funny at times and it gives you a funny story to tell to your friends later on. And thats one big thing I love about Rust PvP. It's so chaotic and random. I hate giving this game a negative review but with the KeyLock Update and now this? I have to change my review from good to bad and it really hurts me to do so. I feel as if Facepunch is making Rust less and less brutal and that makes me sad. If they get rid of this team system I will be thrilled and change my review back to postive again but currently.. They are destroying what is so special about this incredible game.",Rust

I understand this game is in Alpha but at the same time how are you going to let the devs know how to improve the game when you can't even play it with all the hackers ruining your game play? Websites like me ruin games that people play to have fun not to pay to be killed consistantly by hackers in the game.

SS all clan members in here as well. 50 Kickstarter Boomshakalaka all hack. People are getting cheats for this game to even compete in it to prevent being killed constantly by hackers.

2014-04-16,0,0,33,True,Recommended,This is a fantastic concept Minecraft + Scarcity everyone is terrible. It's still in alpha but definitely a more interesting experience than the DayZ standalone currently is. Developers seem to be moving pretty slow with new content and hacking is a serious problem especially when it can take hours of work to build up your home and character and then have them wiped out by cheaters in seconds. Also I tend to mainline games for days or weeks at a time but if you tend not to put too much time into any one game there's no way to make a lot of progress with this one. The sleeper system (where your character never leaves the gameworld and can be looted at any time) doesn't really work yet since there's no static defenses worth anything in place to protect your stuff.tl dr It takes quite a bit of patience and it's an alpha build but if you feel like falling down the rabbit hole this game is already worth days of playtime and it's not even complete yet.,Rust

2015-06-06,0,0,52,True,Not Recommended,There's a lot of naked guys in this game. Not that there's anything wrong with that if that's your thing. But most of these guys are trying bash your head in with a rock.The first days are the hardest. And even after you've survived the animals and made a little makeshift shelter some guy will come along with an assault weapon and murder you for your small stash of rocks and twigs. It's pretty brutal. If you've got friends on the server it makes things much easier but if not you'll most likely just be noob fodder for the hardcore players forever.Not there's anything wrong with that either. But your dreams of glory of taking out that assault gunner with your large rock charging him in the buff... well it's probably never going to happen. So get used to your role... unless you just play forever and never get burnt out.... then maybe you can build a decent sized shelter that can survive an amatuer attempt to break into it.Regardless all the deaths are in great fun. Lot's to explore... although I've never actually talked to anyone in the game. If you're within range of a bullet you probably won't live too long in my experience. Regardless it's still fun. Sort of... if you're into this sort of thing. Just don't take it personally if someone comes along and kills you and loots all the stuff you've spend the last four hours collecting. That's just part of the fun. &lt grin&gt Now let me get back to Distant Worlds and crush a stupid AI guy so I can feel good about myself.,Rust

2014-05-31,0,0,150,True,Not Recommended,Rust is a unbelievable great gaming experience and defently worth the money.Don't play this game alone it still has got a lot to show but you will just find yourself getting overrunned. Play this game with a good friend. It's absurdely fun very rewarding and very very intense.Why I dont recommend this game though is simple Me and my friend stopped playing this game 3 months ago because you have no oppurtinity of saving your stuff in your base. Anytime you go to sleep it was most likely to get raided and start over with nothing again. 80% of your lategame time you spend shivering because everything you collect has to be put into a base which is not even close to safe. And now after 3 months there was not a single change to the whole game espacially not to this huge problem which already many players mentioned.I know this game is Alpha but compared with other alpha games this development is very very very slow. It's exactly 0. Buy this game when its finished but not one day before.I realy enjoyed this game and am looking forward to a version where I'm actually allowed to go to sleep without starting all over again.,Rust
2017-02-24,0,0,317,True,Recommended,I was just looking through the reviews I've written for various games and was suprised to find out that Rust wasn't among them. I've played both Rust Legacy and the new Rust this review will obviously be about the new Rust.Rust is a survival game with a lot of strategic thinking involved when it comes to PvP survival this game is definely the best out there but when it comes to PvE this game is seriously lacking. The monthly wipes are extremely demotivating you from playing the game. Once you've figured out to set up a strong defensive base you manage to defend from raids the game simply decides to wipe everything and lets you start all over. Some people may dislike the fact there aren't any vehicles or that Rust may be missing some other features they would like to see in survival games but there's a lot of things they are still planning to add so keep that in mind.Only recommended if you are into PvP survival. If you are looking for a PvE survival game I would recommend you to play 7 Days To Die.,Rust
2014-05-31,0,0,82,True,Recommended,Rust is a very addictive game it is somewhat of a mix between day z and minecraft to an extent. the beginning content its flawless great gameplay asides from the fps point of it which could use alot of fine tuning very primative gunplay however that alone doesn't justify a bad game by yourself or with a team you guarnteed a good bit of time on each server before it gets stale. That being the one gripe once you make your base and have your blueprints unlocked there is pretty much nothing else to do besides raid other peoples bases and take things that you already have thousands of. so the end game aspect gets 5/10 for those of you who like raiding get those 5 pts. Overall a solid 7/10 hopefully in the comiong days alot more updates release for it and we can see a great game in the making and give your input.,Rust
2015-02-09,0,0,1347,True,Recommended,Not sure why they took a recipe for success and all over it. Legacy was a gold mine. Even if they needed to clean up the code the current game/system is nothing compared to the old system. For example. Why make the map so big trying to find your friend is a 40+ minute event. And Dont try learning the maps. Because they change.... Also a map this big.. It makes things less personal. Rust Legacy had hotspots for pvp. This game I will very randomly see someone run by. Like 1/100th of the activity I would have if I was near small rad.,Rust

Not everyone kills on site and the moments where you bond with a fellow naked man can be the most glorious you'll ever remember. Take the game with a grain of salt and you'll have a good time.,Rust

2016-02-06,0,0,0,True,Not Recommended,"I bought this game while it was still in Alpha state. I bought it quickly on sale because my friends have it and did not check the system requirements before i bought it.Well the 8GB ram requirement was correct. I have 4GB of Ram as a result the game took about 10 minutes to load and start playing on an empty server with low ping. In fact it took more than 2 attempts to even join the server without crashing the game entirely. When i got on line I found a chicken. I stabbed that chicken with a rock repeatedly. He did not die He ran away like a chicken but not before i threw my rock at him in frustration and the rock de spawned. I then found a bear. I remembered my friend telling me ""when you lose you rock you can't do anything. You initially need the rock to harvest materials and you can't even pick up another rock so the only thing you can really do is get killed and when you re spawn you get another rock"" so i was like ""Yay a bear!"". well i would have been like Yay a bear! if i hadn't realized i was naked in the woods (yes naked) without his multi purpose rock with a bear was running right towards me. So i ran like a chicken. The bear chased after me for about 5 seconds before he thought what i can only imagine was ""OOH LOOK A KITTY!"" and went off in another direction. I found materials scattered on the ground (My friend's advice must have applied to before the update that scattered materials on the ground). I crafted a campfire I ate some mushrooms I swam naked through a river and almost froze to death. All in all i spent about 45 minutes ""Playing"" Rust and i feel it could be a lot of fun when it's finished. For now I don't recommend it especially if you have less than the required amount of Ram (8GB).",Rust

2014-06-17,0,0,495,True,Recommended,I'm going to start this review by stating that this game has two versions Legacy which is the original version and Release which is the new and still updating version. I will be giving pros and cons to each of them.There will be a TL DR at the bottom.This game is only multiplayer you can have your own server by renting one or by setting up a free one but it takes some time.This game is still early access (for those who don't know that means it is still being devloped).Legacy The Legacy version is the original version that is no longer being updated but is still played by many because some people feel it is more finished or they like it better. Pros 1. Smooth gameplay. It has smooth gameplay and is pretty easy to get the hang of. 10/102. Graphics. The graphics are pretty good but could be better in my opinion. 9/103. Combat. The combat is pretty good. Some guns feel over powered but are very hard to aquire so it can balance out. However this all depends on the server you play on. 8.5/104. Enemy AI. The enemies are quite unique. The enemies are red mutant animals that will attack you on sight. There are also wolves and bears that will attack you mutant or not. 9.5/105. Servers. There is a very wide variety of servers to choose from and I find that to be succesful you need to find the server that fits you. 9.5/106. Building. The building is fun and smooth. 10/10Cons1. Difficulty. This game can be very hard depending on the server you play on but it is almost always hard to get a good start because of players. A large amount of players will kill on sight. 3/102. Enemy players. The enemy players can be very tough to fight and you may need more than a bow and arrow to kill them however some can become your friend. 3/10Now for Release Release is the latest version and is still being updated. I think it has much better graphics. The gameplay is smooth so far There are little bugs and it is doing pretty well.Here are some pros and cons.Pros 1. Gameplay. The gameplay is smooth and fun to play. 10/102. Graphics. I think the graphics are much prettier than Legacy and are quite impressive. 10/103. Combat. The combat has been improved since Legacy in my opinion. It is solid and easy to get the hang of. 9.5/104. Enemy AI. There are no mutant enemies as of right now but there are still wolves and bears that will attack you. 9/105. Servers. There are still many different servers to choose from. 10/106. The building is smooth and fun. There is a larger variety of building options as well.Cons 1. The difficulty is easier overall than Legacy but the players are still a problem. However this still depends on what server you choose. 4/102. Enemy players. The enemy players are still tough and a lot of them will kill you on sight unfortunatley. 3/10TL DRSo overall this game is pretty good and is getting better. I think the graphics in Release are better than Legacy. The gameplay for both is smooth fun and easy to get the hang of. Release has more building options and is still being updated. So I hope I helped your decision. Thanks for reading.,Rust

2015-02-25,0,0,558,True,Recommended,I recommend this game.... just not right now.If you bought this game a year ago you wouldve been set for one of the best survival/fps experiences available. Obviously those days are over. I still think that this game will emerge as one of the best survival/fps's out there. The new version is still much worse than legacy and will continue to be for a month or two probably. People are expecting the new version to be as fun as legacy yet they fail to realize what level of playability and polish there was on legacy even in the early days.,Rust
2015-02-25,0,0,62,True,Not Recommended,Not a game you can play alone. You need to gather a lot of materials to get any sort of base to even hope to advance and most materails are rare and not anywhere close to other materials. You can spend an hour running around to get just enough to establish a basic non secure base only to get shot once and lose everything having never seen the other guy or had a chance. Animals and rocks are far too rare without ranged weapons the deer run much faster than you and are impossible to catch however you can't build a bow without cloth from animals.It's fun to play if you have a friend to guard while you gather materails or help kill the people trying to kill you but impossible and aggrivating to play alone. If there were more animals in the game it would be far better for single players.,Rust

2015-04-18,0,0,194,True,Not Recommended,I really want to recommend this game and write a good review because i rarely find any survival game as fun as rust.In fact everything about this game is goodI spent countless of hours gathering resources making friends and building massive bases.I had so much fun playing this wonderfull game whitch is in my opinion the best survival multiplayer game out there.At one point after spending countless hours on a server we were pretty much dominating the whole server with my friends.We had literally everything there is to have and we deserved it because we were devoted players.One day I connected to the server just to find someone raiding my base.At first I did not worry to much since all I have to do it to kill him and having played many FPS at competitive level I am pretty confident when it came to facing other players or I could simply Skype call one of my friend to get a hand.Exept that day it was different. It did not matter how long I had spent on that game or the gear I had to defend myself.It did not matter how many people we had to defend our base that we all spent an incredible amount of time to craft.Because all our intruder had to do is press a button and fly across our walls and shoot us trough them.And this is how someone destroyed all our progression that took over months to do in about 30 min and there was nothing we could have done to prevent it.This is just a long story to make you understand how it is literally a waste of time to spend any time progressing on that game because the amount of hacker is unbearable and I have not seen anything get better. I don't think it can be possible for me to write down every encounter I had with hackers in a day.I still have this game installed and every so often I am very tempted to launch it again and find the enjoyment I once had with this wonderful game but sadly the amount of hackers really makes me want to never play it ever again.TL DR The amount of hackers is unbearable and makes this game unplayable.,Rust
2015-04-18,0,0,73,True,Recommended,I have to recommend this game because i think it is getting better with each update.The building is fun and it's not that hard as it was when it got out the survival is not that bad since you don't need to eat every 5 minuts but the community...if you don't have friends to play this game or any decent group just don't get the game....it's not the only survival type game that i have and it's the one with the worst community to play imo very childish.,Rust

2017-04-10,0,0,2275,True,Recommended,Great game love it raiding pvp betrayals. Except you can't play any offical servers because a ton of hackers. Literally unplayable on one month wipe servers. And all the community servers with actual active admins are 1 week. Other than playing 1 month servers (Offical servers) Rust is a great experience the animal glitching seems to be an inside joke on Rust players because it's been around for a while. But that sudden rush when you get after killing off someone inside a trap base or fighting off a zerg is great. And in rust you truly have to carefully pick who you decide to pick. Make the right decisions you meet amazing people. The wrong one your base gets single handely destroyed by someone you thought was a great friend.,Rust

People say ""just learn the patterns Its so noob can just jump in and kil someone with 4k hours"" but it puts anyone who has less than 1k hours on this game and dosnt spend hundreds of hours on battlefield server practicing their spray patters at a huge disadvantage. There is no point of even pvping people because all the poeple on every server that has aks and guns are those 3k+ hours people and just spray you down its . there are some people who have few hours and dominate in PVP but its becuase they have a lot of experience with shooters and spray patterns.",Rust
2015-08-29,0,0,779,False,Recommended,"Rust is one of the most engaging and original survival games I have ever played. I've had it for a while and as both a player and a former server owner it's been a privilege to watch it evolve from its early states to its current build. If you're willing to dedicate certain windows of time to each playthrough I strongly recommend it.First of all don't be deterred by the ""Early Access Survival"" stereotype. Rust has VERY active developers and in all my time playing it I've come across few if any serious bugs all of which are usually patched within a month. Its only real issue is the optimization which can be a problem sometimes but is a fair trade for the gorgeous graphics.Rust also has a very peculiar community something it's been known for from the start. People can be the best and worst part of the game. Depending on the server you're playing on there can be lots of KOSers and trolls and raiders but there can also be some of the funniest most involved players you'll find in any game. Some of the encounters you'll have in this game are... hard to describe (but good).The gameplay itself is very engaging and rewarding. Although there's some grinding in early game the progression in crafting and learning will entice you to keep playing especially since there are often new items and parts added by the devs that will shake things up and revive any dwindling interest you may have. In addition there is a strong element of exploration where you'll begin to memorize the locations of loot spots and the layout of the different monuments on whatever randomly generated map you're playing on at the time. There's also a great base building system that although initially a little confusing is easy to pick up on and very rewarding. There are also lots of little tricks you'll probably learn along the way that make it that much more interesting.In regards to the PVP raids are often brief but brutal and intense. Both sides have a lot to lose and preparing for a raid can be a big deal early game. In addition there's a definite social aspect to many raids so if you consider yourself a good manipulator it's always possible you might be able to con your way to somebody's loot. That said raiding is not the only way to progress in game so if you're not a fan of fighting you can always avoid it.Rust's ""story"" is mostly implied (or nonexistent) but the unique elements that make up its world and aesthetic are more than enough to fuel the imagination of anybody looking for a narrative. Basic elements such as the unmarked helicopter that patrols the island periodically and the mysterious abandoned monuments that dot every map raise questions and make for an interesting setting for any interactions you may have but their presence is unintrusive enough to avoid interfering with players' individual interpretations. This is especially good for people who like to assume characters in multiplayer. I haven't exactly tried that myself but you'll run into it occasionally and it definitely makes for some interesting interactions (often involving cults).As mentioned in the beginning Rust will unfortunately eat up a good amount of time. Since you leave behind sleepers and buildings have a ""decay"" mechanic on some servers it's best you either come into the game with friends or find some friends in game before starting any super serious playthroughs just to make sure somebody's watching the house. Last I checked though the devs have been adding some mechanics to take the edge off of this downside so that people can play it without dedicating too much time. That said you can always play casually just expect to get raided a little more often.So in conclusion Rust is a great survival experience regardless of the stigma surrounding early access survival games. As long as you can clear up some time once in a while to really get into it and/or have or find some friends to play it with Rust is probably one of the best multiplayer survival experiences on Steam and its active involvement with the community and constantly evolving nature serves to keep that even more interesting.",Rust

After playing this for only 10 minutes i was hooked.A very simple and easy game to learn and friendly to newer players.Rust is one of those games where you can spend hours days making the mega base that you want and then you can happily build a bigger and even better base after that.Even in beta it is still better ( in my opinion ) than most AAA titles.10/10 Cjay,Rust

2016-02-10,0,0,122,True,Recommended,What did I experience playing Rust so far? I got paranoid while playing I saw a lot of nudity I got killed by Rocks I got raided a lot I got a personal enemy in the game Funny glitches Lots of fun with friendsBut now to the actual review Rust is a PVP heavy survival game with no real rules to the game. You can build a massive base a tiny shack raid other people kill them or just live a peaceful hermit life. (actualy you can't do the last unless you are playing on an empty server which would not be the point of the game anyways). At the moment there are monthly map wipes forced by the developer every so often also blueprint wipes which can be depressing at some points but at the same time also quite challenging.From the performance I think the game is well enough optimised to play it without bigger issues of course there can be bugs and performance dips because of its Early Access stage.I'd say overall Rust is a pretty good game to play together with some friends. If you're thinking about playing it alone forget that idea an search for some mates to play with. If you can pick it up for a good price I say do it. I had a great time playing it so far but keep in mind that Rust is a pretty time consuming game.,Rust

2014-11-27,0,0,383,True,Recommended,"""I loved this game and had hundreds of hours playing before they got rid of the zombies that seemed to be the beginning of a downward spiral. Legacy had its issues but it had a following and people loved it if the game had stayed in legacy and got proper updates it would have been out by now and kept its following. The new version of the game has some merit but it changed enough that it is no longer a game I can say I enjoy. I can say I got my moneys worth of the game already in legacy during the prime of the game... so there is that.. but those days are long over. At this rate the game will be unpopular and feel quite old by the time it is released and I still have considerable doubts that the game will ever release. This is going to be yet another EA game which slaps a 1.0 on a broken game and calls it complete. ""The above section in quotations is my review for Rust when legacy had just changed. I'm happy to report that I can change this review now and probably should have. As I've put probably 200 more hours into the game since and revisit it every few months. I no longer believe that this will remain an unfinished game and the constant flow of content coming is very encouraging. The new rust had a poor start but the devs have more than made up for it. I keep coming back for more and the game has become one of my favorites. I was very skeptical at first but I have been happily proven wrong. I look forward to what the future has to offer.",Rust

2014-01-13,0,0,66,True,Recommended,I started rust a while back and at first it was difficult. My first couple of servers I either had a guy chasing me with a rock or a zombie beat the crap out of me. Since then I learned alot. First this game has so much potential second if you buy this game go to a server with no pvp and make sure there are few people it will help you get started. Its really a great game and has alot of potential.,Rust
2014-01-13,0,0,147,True,Recommended,"They got some Minecraft in my DayZ.That was my knee jerk reaction when I first started playing and after 40 hours on the game I maintain a similar stance. I know it isn't a terribly insightful observation but that is what the game feels like. Rust has some qualities of both games and while they aren't necessarily intricate at the moment (""it's an alpha"") they do function well. Home building is simple and fairly well executed and it feels like a great baseline for it going forward and there are some details to it currently that show what it could ultimately become. For example if you insist on making windows make sure to put some bars on them less someone uses them as an access point with a conveniently placed staircase outside your abode (a lesson learned from experience). Crafting is straight forward and the system by which you unlock new builds definitely ratchets up the drive for either raiding ""rad"" towns and the chests/zombies therein or raiding your fellow players as either finding blueprints or researching an already constructed item is the only way to learn some things. And just finding the blueprint isn't always the answer. Finding the blueprint for explosive charges is great but if you or your buddy can't make explosives it's ultimately useless until you can. This system has potential to create a player trading market but ""trade"" is a word that rarely seems to come up among players.Of course the biggest aspect of the game is really PVP/PVE as you need to engage in one (or both) of these to really get anywhere. Unfortunately the PVE isn't really there. Period. Yeah there are zombies and aggro animals but they aren't really that difficult to defeat (most require 1 or 2 arrows) and most of the time fairly easy to avoid. There are some resource fields and lootable chests that are virtually devoid of PVE threats and unless you're a very poor judge of where to place your house you'll never need it for defense from the environment. I think the best step for the game would be to figure out what direction they want to take the environmental threats and go with it. Get that system up and running and give the game some extra tension and raise the threat level not only for those who prefer PVE but also for those engaging in PVP. It's one thing to make sure your house is secure from a roving pack of zombies it's an entirely different thing to have your raiding party be ambushed while you pillage some saps house.Which of course brings me to PVP. Honestly it can be really fun when you get 2 or 3 groups all running for an air drop and an epic firefight breaks out but the KOS mentality really can ruin the experience. There is nothing more frustrating than being popped in the head twice after calling for ""friendly"" and putting your hatchet away (yep melee against a gun I'm outmatched dude). You want my stuff? Fine demand it I'm not going to resist at 2 v 1 with no weapon. Other reviewers have brought this up and I just want to reiterate how bloody stupid and frustrating it is. And in reality it breeds that same mentality in other people. After being KOS while posing no threat so many times eventually people will adopt or quit playing. In either case or a multitude of others it's just not cool. People play games for fun or to relax whats the point in ruining it? Edit One more note on KOS and PVP. Some people are completely lacking in class. Laying ambushes after asking for help to get somewhere (fought my way out of that one) then later coming back with your group to raid said friendly players after which you gloat about your raid. Yeah tactics like that are valid but man do they speak volumes. _ Overall I have enjoyed a lot about the game though I've only mentioned some of the things that worked really well for me. I think there is a lot of potential in Rust and if you're on the fence about it I urge you to at least hang around and see what changes are made. I think with current systems fleshed out and a stronger PVE plus some attitude improvement on the part of the community (but every game has its jerks) this will be a lot of fun for big groups small parties and lone wolfs.",Rust

2016-02-12,0,0,665,True,Recommended,If you're looking for a very realistic game which you can build your base to protect yourself and would love to protect it against enemy fire this is definitevely the game for you. Even though building in Rust doesn't allow you to be very creative it won't really make a difference for you as soon as you play it for a little longer due to Rust being a game that doesn't focus on one thing. Although shooting in Rust is hard as result of it beign a very realistic game the overall combat between players or entities is great and unique. The graphics of the game are great from 1 10 I'd give it an 8 even though it doesn't have a single set map every server has It's own generated map. The main flaw of Rust is that it is very bad optimized it doesn't run on any computer for example I use a GTX 980 and it doesn't run smoothly at all and I can barely keep it on 60 FPS. FPS drops drastically in shootous for example and sometimes it runs at 1 5 FPS for several seconds for no reason.,Rust

A rock that'll help in your quest to grind items later in the game you would need to use the rock to collect resources making different items and collectibles to level up your game. You can hit rocks and trees to collect materials like wood and stone used to make weapons storage and variety of other stuff.I don't know what it is with this game. Maybe it's the fact that you spawn unclothed and uncensored maybe it's the brutal vastness of the design or maybe it's the simple uncouth joy of doing bad things to other human beings but Rust has a distinctly regressive effect on the human species.

2014-04-28,0,0,3,True,Not Recommended,HUUR DUUR I CANT TAKE CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM (Review date 7th May 2014)My verdict I KINDA regret buying this.BUT not because it's a bad game it's a good game but it's a bit boring in its current state however the concept is great.DayZ and MineCraft had a baby and made this and its great but it's weighed down by the lack of content the fairly bad graphics but max does look pretty in some circumstances the theme is okay but the character models and various textures pop out and lack contrast to the background and somehow causes them to smear together in a rounded edged mess of some sort hard to explain.So overall give it some polish and it'll be good even though it sounds hard to judge an alpha game but even they have to take some critisism for that is what drives them forward to making the right choices for the game. I'm not saying Rust has done some bad choices it has a lot of potential in its current state but give it some time and I will edit this review and talk about the good points.In conclusion if you're willing to support the devs you can buy this. It's better with friends and the best friends are ones with knowledge of the game as it isn't friendly to beginners and offers a clunky interface. If you don't want to buy this I recommend coming back in a few months and see how far it's come maybe then it will be worth the buy.,Rust

Some of the best times in this game were spent trying to find our friends with no navigation skills and then escorting them back to base while they acted like classic escort NPCs who get distracted by shiny things and need a kick in the butt to get them moving again.The thing that ruins it for me is base raiding. Raiding is part of the game I understand that but (as an example here) when you can play the game for 23 hours and see no action then that 1 hour you're offline you get raided. It will frustrate you to no end. You'll almost feel as if they are sitting there waiting for you to go offline just so they can walk in and get easy loot. That is just not fun.

2016-03-31,0,0,86,True,Not Recommended,I bought this game quite a bit ago around when it came out and everyone was in that 'multiplayer survival' phase and like to leave it uninstalled. It looks kind of better than it originally was and when i dicked around with it in its present state the building was a little dfferent but other that that and some new weapon additions its the same old Not that it was awful I'd just expect to be able to drop a game in developement and come back to it a few years later and see something progress. As for now I'll continue to enjoy looking at this game's permanently faded out title on my list and periodically checking for mild GUI updates and performance tweaks until I reach my early thirties.P.S.

2014-04-27,0,0,151,True,Recommended,This game is based on survival. That is the pretty much the core game besides trust and descions. The big part of the game i love that has over dayz that it constently gets updates and there is base building. But its good on how you make desions on wheather to attack another player and risk losing your loot or gaining more loot. Making friends is a really important thing in the game so they can back you up when you are in trouble. But unfortunaly there are alot of people that wont want to team so you have to make enimes to keep an eye out. BUt im exicited to see where the future of the game will go.

Ilove contrustion but why takes all my hunger? i alwasy die from hunger i cant get food easly with a rock and everything takes alot of hunger away from me4.RADATION? i love how this was added into the game but its near bulidings and stuff which i get but i always get a huge spiked radiation an die which sucks5.The map? Love it huge lots of land but u cant build on rocks bummer and i am alwasy found by others and the spaning is cool by ranomizing it but if i dont have a base i lose everything kinda sucks so atleast think about putting in a spawn close to death setup.So far i love the game an i hope it get better as it goes along!!! ),Rust
2014-04-27,0,0,35,True,Recommended,The game has great feel to it like you are really in post apocallyptic world but it still needs development.Even if it is still in alpha it is great you can build your own base your own weapons hunt animals. Stuff to keep you entertained for hours. When you have the basics up you want better weapons to protect your goodies so you go out and hunt red bears and red wolves. And thats where you will meet the biggiest problem Almost anyone who sees you will kill you. There are places where you can hide yourself in the world but better stuff (red bears and red wolves) only appear near radiated zones which are pretty small and there are few of them in the world. Then you will keep loosing your hard earned stuff over and over and you will get annoyed greately and probably finnish up rage quitting swearing and never wanting to play again. Sure you can make lockable backpack but you still need to find blueprint for it plus if your killer has lockpick you loose your stuff anyway. If you play solo then you will not last very long I guarantee you that (unless you play on empty server). As of now you should play with at least two other friends. One way that could resolve meaningless killing is creating teams. Think about it. Your own people can no longer kill you (or you would get big punishment for teamkilling) people would actualy do organised raids (yes you can break into someones house. I was really surprised when a guy blasted my wooden door with c4 and me with his m4) fighting over radiated zones making big fortresses that actually matter... Well maybe one day.If you have spare money and want to play some fun game with friends then go ahead buy it It is fun! (even with few game glitches and some other lesser flaws). If you want to play solo then i say that you will have fun too but you will get annoyed by people quickly (I did not believe other articles and they turned out to be true).Final verdict at this point 6/10 people are the worst. It could be 7/10 or higher you ruined it you random killing maniacs! &gt (,Rust

2017-02-22,0,0,1089,False,Not Recommended,Love this game. I bought it in a Humble Bundle late 2016 or early 2017. The game has lots to offer the graphics are actually really nice. The crafting and loot system is lots of fun and so is the building system. However there is one reason I cannot recommend this game in its current state. Its an unbalanced mess right now and there is no initiative to even fix it and its ruining the overall gaming experience out of it. The grind isn't the bad part is the Random Generated Luck chances you get of finding certain loot and then the high ammount of SCRAPS it takes to learn that blue print.Put it this way you have very small percentage possibility to find certain equipment guns ladders ladder hatches and even some clothing. Ones you find them you have to learn the Blue Print for this item in order to craft it. Learning the Blue Print for Ladder cost as much as the Double Barrel Shotgun and this just makes no sense. The ladder should cost no more than 75 SCRAP's. The chances of finding a ladder hatch are slim to none I have grinded for 40 hours and Not 1 time have I found a Ladder Hatch. Bottom line is there needs to be a lot more focuse on balancing Crafting and Reaserch. As of now I won't recommend this game.http //rust.wikia.com/wiki/Research_Table,Rust

2014-01-17,0,0,156,True,Recommended,Even thought the game is great and I admit it is very entertaining i must say what puts it off could be the radiation areas which even thought they contain valuable and incredible objects that sometimes result necessary it puts the player in a risky situation in which he can easily lose all he has as the radiation is very high in addition to said problem there is little to no luck finding any and all clothing anti radiation or pills this are rare and normally are within radiation areas making it highly improvable to find them. In addition the multiple players killing each other render less experienced players vulnerable as they kill them once the player progress and provokes a frustration and probable quitting so probably making the fire weapons (shotguns per example) should be a bit harder to obtain as it gives a greater chance of abusing it and tending to kill players for the sake of it.,Rust

2014-01-17,0,0,62,True,Recommended,Besides having our assess kicked again and again by PvP players once you find a good place to set and a friendly player (you may die many times before you find a friendly one lol) you start to really play the game. In your first days you will collect basic (wood food stone minerals and cloth) resources during the day and hide during the night while you build your settlement. Eventually you make some clothes (fortunately there is no nudity anymore lol) make a furnace some weapon then you realize that it is time to face zombies and kill it for their valuable loot so you can start making better things. Now things start getting complicated lot of research kits and a friend who is in better technological condition than you (so he can share his techies in order for you to learn it) or luckily find the blueprints you need to progress.Do I recommend it??

2016-02-14,0,0,168,True,Not Recommended,"I had Hopes for this game it claims to be a survival game just like Dayz it has the same problems at the base level as Dayz so here are the Big problems1. Claims to be a survival game but is a glorified deathmatch Let me explain Just like dayz this game is supposed to be a survival game This means that this game should make you struggle to keep yourself alive from the enviroment alone it should make one struggle to find food and water or it should make it hard to survive attacks from predators MAKING PLAYERS THE ONLY THREAT IN A SURVIVAL GAME IS WRONG. Making players the only tangible threat is what breeds boredom which will lead to players killing on sight ""KOS"" just to make the game bareable of course there are jerks that will kill you for no reason but a survival game should punish that heavily ideally by maintenance of weapons Attracting very dangerous predators or by using very Rare and precious supplies in the act of killing another player a survival game should make one think and plan ahead. It should reward players for socialising or at the very least socialize in a meaningful way Sadly this won't happen very often with how the game is set up ammo and guns are common as you can just craft them you don't need to eat all that often and food and water are plentiful the only saving grace would be if rust had some NPCs that would tear a player a new one if he or she wasn't careful which it doesn't the addition of an LMG and Scope are just two instances of making it even easier to kill players and encouraging playstyles that may be detrimental to the enjoyment of others eg. killing freshspawns and rooftop camping.2. The community Don't get me wrong there are some people in this game that try to socialize and have reasons to kill or raid other reasons besides for stuff they don't need they may set up shops but the vast majority are players who just draw on signs or mess with new players griefing them which is somewhat understandable as there is nothing to do unless one decides to mess with players however the thing that makes the community unbearable is that a lot of players on this game have a laser focus on killing alienating other players when someone thinks differently and when one tries to criticize the game many of them will come up with weak excuses the more immature ones will just claim that you're off because you got your handed to you.3. Development I will not deny that the game is having features added to it The foundation of the game either remains unchanged or had a half patch to attempt to please those who were complaining about a feature that is a part of it's foundation eg. Blueprint system and crafting times. The game also had a lot of updates that encouraged a deathmatch or team deathmatch mentality The game is in development which means that the devs should focus on the foundation first and then build upon that foundation while there is a foundation it is an incredibly shoddy one as evidenced by the complaints on the facepunch forums regarding blueprints crafting times and other issues located at the core of the gameplay. Facepunch has also been giving reasons to play as a group but giving very little incentives to have players socialize and form a group. It is obvious what FP is trying to do but FP does not know how to get the desired outcome.Rust isn't a survival game in it's current state and unless facepunch step up it's game rust will never be a survival game it is instead like Dayz in which it is mind numbingly boring unless you try to kill another player there is little reason to socialize there are no other real dangers besides other players there is every reason to kill everyone you see.TLDR Rust is not a survival game in it's current state it is a glorified deathmatch with crafting and building elements chucked in if you want a hardcore survival experience then pass it up if all you want to do is kill and grief other players than this game is for you!",Rust
2016-02-14,0,0,40,True,Not Recommended,I really try to like this game I really wanted to however it's community is absolutly atrocious. People killing eachother left and right with no way to truely progress due to the constant spaw killing. I really wanted to like this game but I just can't muster the strength to pull myself to it. I am usualy finding myself closing it down in a fit of rage because of the way the people act in game and how they treat one another in game. In my advice if you are able to put up with yelling screaming and having death everytime you spawn than this is the game for you but I am not one to enjoy this in any way.

Between frequent updates great graphics and a rather friendly community (depending on server) it stands far above most other games in the crafting/survival community.Pros + Fast gameplay ( you could have a pretty good base in about an hour or two i you know what you are doing ) Air drops and the relatively new helicopter forces players to fight for the best loot Voice communication is distance based and anonymous NO ZOMBIES ( personally I feel that zombie survival is an much overdone topic in the survival genre) Naked guys guys killing each otherCons Not optimized very well at the moment but it is still playable on low and mid tier system Kids playing usually dont know how to communicate resulting in them killing you on sight There are some glitches currently but with update every month or so they sould be fixed soon Gathering gets a little stale after awhile but building quarries stops the grind fest""but overall Rust is an 9/10 (will be 10/10 as soon as glitches are fixed and optimizations take place)",Rust

Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).2. Combine butter white sugar brown sugar water cinnamon and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil remove from heat and set aside.3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9 inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate pour in apple slices.4. Roll out top crust into a 10 inch circle. Cut into 8 (1 inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips one at a time into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.5. Pour butter sugar mixture over top of pie coating the lattice and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and bake until the crust is golden brown the caramel on the top crust is set and the apple filling is bubbling 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.,Rust

2016-02-15,0,0,693,True,Recommended,The game is awesome. It is one of those games that I keep coming back to every other month. Something game changing has been added and its all stuff that looks towards the future of the game. If you are new Do NOT go to a high population server!! Find a dead server and play on there. Get an idea how to play practice etc... I find the most entertaining servers are the ones with low population. As many negative reviews have said It is a death match at times. You can counter this with small servers which usually have nice people on them with the occasional jerk. People assume you are going to attack them and so they go after you first. Building is very fun. You can make your own base and learn hard lessons on how to make a base even better over time. Friends are extremely nice to have and you will find groups of people willing to take you in if you are not a jerk.,Rust

2016-02-16,0,0,980,True,Recommended,Where to start with this game??? Overall this game can be fun solo but in my experience it is much more fun with a group. Raiding is something that either you are apart of your something that happens to you. It is the main goal of the game. Sadly this and many other games like this have only two player types. Those that get KOS or those that KOS. 90% of players experience both ends of that stick. I can't wait to see more development with the game and what new in game items are coming. Some tech would be awesome to see in the game. More raiding items weapons clothing and maybe some more world events (Earthquake or something). Some servers have really cool night time plugins.,Rust

2017-03-25,0,0,211,True,Recommended,Overall notbad.I have to state that overall this game is really REALLY good there are so many original (at the time of release) ideas and many hours of fun to be had with this game but it is also plagued with alot of downsides that overall balance out as an ok game.This is the game that really defined the survival genre that is currently plaguing steam with early alpha released that never seem to get released or updated after the first year or so. You start naked alone and afraid. Slowly searching for basic resources such as food stones and wood so that you can survive your first night in some crappy shack of a shelter you spend buildling before the sun sets. You then see something a person maybe he can help desperatly you run over to greet this person (maybe he can help?) you get closer and closer and suddenly he see's you now you are both running towards each other (this is great) and just as you are a few yards away this nut job opens fire at you and turn and run towards the woods bleeding runing out of health and stamina you pick up a stone to make your stand you aim and throw your rock at this nutters head... but it misses the last things you see and hear are a gun shot and a barage of teabagging and insults whilst you are robbed of your sticks stones and raw chicken meat and left to bleed out in the sun.Welcome to rust! Where friendly means hostile AF neighbours are more dangerous than bears and plentiful resources like wood are treated like platinum. Sounds horrible doesn't it? Well no. The adrenaline and rush of finally getting on your feet are amazing having a home that is fairly safe is great and ocne you get together with some friends and turn from hopeless noob to full time raider is some of the best gaming experiences I have ever had. I havn't played this in a while but when I last played this created some of my fondest gaming memories ever.Pros'Good graphicsLots of craftingFun combatFun solo amazing with a groupCan spend many hours back to back playing this gameLots of updatesLarge communityCon'sThe dev's do seem uninterested in the communityLots of changes many for the worseStill in Early access after many yearsNot very noob friendlyRather toxic players depending on serverPlagued with bugsIn regards to the dev's comment I would like to state I have never played the game to a level where I have taken a massive interest in changes or lack of updates (I think its ok) but many serious players have complained about this and the response from the Dev was simply if you don't like it stop playing it. Now although I agree with this for any game if the players are feeling that things are that bad and that people are not enjoying it but for a Dev to ignore requests and come back with a comment like this does show that the game isn't really being built around the community. I noticed this in the original rust (which ahd zombies and one map) I really liked that rust and despite a large uproar about the changes to what is now the normal rust the dev's ignored this and made alot of changes that people really didn't want.Overall however from me Great game and strongly recomend.,Rust

2016-03-21,0,0,589,True,Recommended,Rust is a social experiment. Anything you craft in game can and probably will be raided and stolen no matter the defenses. People will add you to their friends list for the sole purpose of knowing if you're offline or not in game so as to determine the perfect time to steal all your items. Rust is a soul crushing digital manifestation of what happens when the world breaks down and guns and explosives are the only form of barter or negotiation.It is a beautiful game. The sunrises and sunsets are majestic.What it does to people. however is the exact opposite. Rust is a more brutal unforgiving and relentless online arena than EvE Online as even in EvE. you could park your assets in a neutral station and wait for the storm to pass. Here the storm is everywhere... right outside your door crawling on your ceiling while you're asleep in your bed. Waking up to find your assets intact in Rust can be considered a major accompishment and usually only practical for those in large clans which cross multiple time zones.Copy Pasta,Rust

2016-02-01,0,0,149,True,Recommended,Ok I have been playing more rust lately and I must say... It is a lot better with friends. My first review was negative because of the poor community and other stuff... But I have changed my mind. So I guess this is my new and improved review.PROS Fun to play with friends Many MANY servers to chose from An Ok community on some servers Open world gameplay Many bugs some are really funny Updated VERY frequentlyCONS Pumpjack can't be crafted anymore?? 9 times out of ten the loot crates have useless junk in them Bad community on many servers Face clips through your weapon alot (9 times out of 10) Holo Sight reticule keeps disappearing!! Many bugs some are annoying. Updates are almost too frequentSo in conclusion RUST is and awesome game to play with friends it is updated frequently but it has many bugs and a poor community on some servers. I know it is still early access so it really doesn't bug me all that much.I recommend this game to people who have friends or people who can make friends easily. Because in all honesty this game is extremely boring when you are alone.Well that is my new review... I should probably get back to work now.,Rust

2016-01-31,0,0,499,True,Recommended,It's an OK game if you have a team to play with. You have to have a team to be able to play PvP and actually be able to accomplish anything. Otherwise you'll spend most of your time dying and farming for everything you keep losing. Servers vary from under populated and mundane to over populated blood baths. If you're looking for an exciting survival of the fittest game to play with a large group of frriends then this is a great game for you. If you want to play solo then I would suggest a PvE server.,Rust

2016-03-23,0,0,972,True,Not Recommended,Quickly to say it Game itself is great! Could play it everyday 24/7 /365 days a year. But why not recommending? Servers are full of cheaters. Anti Hack is useless doesn't do anything. Avoid the game for now until they manage Easy Anti Cheat to start banning cheaters else you will be disappointed when after playing for 17 days your base is gone and not because of poorly secured base or loot room but because of cheaters.,Rust

2016-03-23,0,0,390,True,Not Recommended,This game and the cheating in this game is unfairly regulated by the admins on the modded servers. If you do choose to purchase this game I would recomend that you not go on modded servers because it is by the admins descresion that you are banned or vac banned if you are cheating or not because they do not require proof and you could end up wasting twenty dollars. My apologies to those who were unfairly banned and im sorry steam is lazy and does not care if you are banned for a plausable reason or not and idioticly believe the admins who are just idividuals who pay for the servers and have their power unchecked which results in players being vac banned and are unable to play the game they purchased. This is a excellent game but the regulation and control of admin's power was not well thought out or was not given conception at all.,Rust

It's in early development...there will be glitches and some things may not make sense yet (like why is that plane not landing and helping me?)3.

Yes their is still much work to be done still but this game has come a long way and I strongly recommend this game. Yes their are many survival games out their but a lot of them are zombie survival. Their is only a small few survival games that do not have zombies are sometype of horrifying monster in them. This game is totally worth checking out.

2015-02-04,0,0,304,True,Recommended,Bullets and other craftables no longer stack when being made and are lost if you do not manually stack them. Video settings keep AUTO changing back to 'beautiful' or whatever the ultra fast computer/GPU setting is (12 FPS for me even though I get 60's to 70's in Fallout NV and Skyrim). I keep waking up half health which is annoying. I might understand waking up hungry. PLEASE make the optimization and animals better? The herky jerky movements of animals and players is driving me mad. The new UI leaves much to be desired. I can no longer see the Chat the 'loot' is all of a sudden to the right of my inventory even though there is enough room the top where it was before which is an intuitive placement. Make the game WORK then make it pretty or 'cool looking'... All this 'beauty' and 'detail' without actual mechanics and items that work properly is kind of silly don't you think? Come on guys.Overall fun game and keep up the work. But if a patch is going to set you backwards in progress why do it?,Rust

2015-02-18,0,0,76,True,Recommended,"Ive been playing since the beginning and have noticed(along with everyone else)a lot of improvement and alot of downgrades.It started out like any other survival game go hear gather this craft this wala now you can make these items.But after playing the game for several hours(and being killed in the process or stuck in some kind of gangwar)i found it to be diffrent.Usally people target each other for the main reasons of ""Hey theres a person attack them for no reasons!""or youve offended them somehow or they just simply want your gear.Now theyve moved onto lagcy which feels like a whole new rust but in a good way.Crafting has been heavily upgraded along with structures loot and combat(no more animals running through the ground still chaseing you damn bears).The laggy servers and connection issues seem to be strightend up for the most part and they reguarly update which is a good thing meaning their adding new content but constantly fixing bugs.I recommend this game highly if your into survival games but must say it makes life easier and safer if you have friends to play along with now get out there and beat objects with a rock!",Rust

2015-02-18,0,0,20,True,Recommended,BRING BACK THE ZOMBIES AND OTHER ANIMALS!!!Hello Rust Developers I have been playing rust for about two weeks now and it isnt what I really expected to see. One of the main reasons i purchased this game was to survive in a VR zombie apocalypse. I watched many gameplay videos before i finally purchased it and when i first played I have only been killed once from the wilderness. There is hardly starving to death anymore and the system for bodily hydration definitely needs some work. I can sprint through the desert in snow gear and be perfectly hydrated. I heard one of the reasons that zombies were kicked from the game was because during development you guys wanted to make them randomly generated with cloths and equipment and what not. I say this would be cool but would only take up alot of time worth spent else where. If I were killed by a zombie I would prefer to have a choice of what I could do. Forcing my character to commit suicide or becoming a zombie. Now this is what I would like to see either i can partially control my character but his presence is able to infect others while being slowly infected by the virus (maybe a cure) once the virus has fully taken over the player loses all control and the zombie romes around killing in his armor possibly dropping his backpack after a short time. Or the virus is fast acting and I lose all control over my character and am allowed to start over. This game has so much potential especially from the realism of it but is seriously lacking with only deers and wolves only attracting survivalists. A virus speaks to a whole other community of zombie lovers. I would really like to see this game becoming a massive community against a great opponent.,Rust

The devs do not have a clear vision for the game nor any actual game design competence they basically just change stuff frequently only to often make things worse. Their developement focus is misdirected fractioned and SLOW. They keep tweaking working aspects when the game lacks features and assets that should have been core (like the abysmal wildlife and its laughable AI).

2014-03-15,0,0,581,True,Not Recommended,Been playing this game since 2013. I've watched it grow and change and I've also watched Rust's soul fade away over time and the game itself go from a unique Pvp/raiding survival game with all the little quirks and stuff that came with it to a boring paltry grindfest. This game is impossible to play if you dont have 2 3 friends willing to play with you at all times. Don't buy it if your friends play other video games. This game runs like Don't buy it if your graphics card was made before 2015. To succeed in this game and have fun you need to play for 16 hour intervals at minimum otherwise you will just get offline raided. Don't buy it if you like engaging in other activities such as eating food taking a dump or leaving the house. Rust currently gives fresh player spawns little to no options when it comes to finding a weapon or otherwise useful item whilst roaming around. Don't buy it if you don't like linear progression in almost every scenario. The developers are constantly changing the game around to what they think the community would like not what they actually ask for or discuss on r/playrust. Don't buy it if you can't put up with essential game mechanics changing or being removed overnight for no reason whatsoever.+Devs give weekly updates detailing their great progress in 'balancing' weapons or retexturing bears or something. amazing.I find no enjoyment in playing rust anymore. Buy it if you find it on sale for $5 I guess.,Rust

However whether it's solo or that one person out of the 500 people you've seen that doesn't kill on site and decides to team with you it can be a very fun and competitive game. With any competitive game you will get mad a lot easily. However that's makes it a ton more satisfying when you get a yummy headshot or take out a squad of 8 kids screaming nonsense and racial slurs. You can work for two weeks and get it all taken away but you can just as easily make it back whether you kill someone and steal it or just go dark it back. Lots of people that make you want to frisbee your monitor but worth it in my opinion especially if you find a fun group to team with.,Rust

You run around surviving with friends or alone in a huge world. When you get Rust you want to be (and have)A. Good at FpsB. Have fast reflexesC. Have a decent computer.When playing Rust you need a decent computer to load up the beautiful world otherwise it will lag u and give u bad framerate. You also want to be good at fps and have fast reflexes so that you can survive in the harsh world and also to constantly keep all of your harvested sh!t.Rust is about surviving which is a huge aspect of the game. You will need to farm and if some players kill you you need to keep pushing. People are complaining about big Clans taking over servers and obliterating everyone. I RECOMMEND you to play with friends otherwise Rust will be NO fun for you. You will play for a few hours and then never touch it again.Some solutions to big clans taking over are Playing on special non clan servers playing with friends to clash with the clans create your own clan or play on servers that are not hosted in your continent. That way they are asleep.Rust is extremely fun to play because you get tons of action a survival feeling and a satisfied feeling when you kill someone. Plus Rust keeps your adrenaline pumping.For newbies There was an xp update where instead of getting bp frags from barrels you get xp and level up everytime you farm. That way you level up and use xp to learn basic crap like tools and sleeping bags.I hope you have fun playing Rust! If you have any questions or thought this was somewhat helpful or helpful please like so others can see the feedback.,Rust

2018-03-11,0,0,924,False,Recommended,Start with nothing but a rock a half full health bar and a hungry stomash.You might just want to craft a spear or a bow first thing. But why Chop ? you ask. cause that 12 year old punk that kicked over your trash can yesterday is running over with his friends to yell YEEEET ! call you a and kill you with a AK. Respawn run inland gather 5 000 wood with each swing at 5 wood hop over a hill and find a wolf biting your noodle off. Very few say Hello and when they do you still might get a rock to the head or an arrow in your Oh you found a crate with a custom SMG ? Nice ! but now your dead of radiation cause not only do you have to worry about little timmy. But the weather radiation animals traps and lets not forget about the AI with choppers that will gun you down for haveing a nail gun out. A tank that will your whole crew for giveing it a bad look. But dont worry you will respawn and do it alllll over again. I used to kind of be an angry person befor playing rust. Ive learned I didnt even know what being mad was . So do you want to be the sheep ? or get the sheeps ? Life isnt fair Rust isnt either.,Rust

2015-01-14,0,0,21,True,Not Recommended,"Rust has one problem or at least one main problem I encoutered and it's that it rarely has the best of both worlds. What I mean by this is that if you go to a server with a lot of people you will barely find any resources and when you do some random guy will kill you and take your stuff and then you have to march 5 000 miles in the opposite direction because the tree you cut down was the only tree for miles. I don't blame the player for killing me and taking my resources because that's part of the game kill or be killed but it gets irratating due to how scarce the resources are and everytime you try to cut down one tree you die. and its marching simulator all over again. Lets not forgot that the landscape feels like a real estate simulator.However if you choose a server with few people you'll have plenty of resources but rarely will you interact with someone or feel threatened. Now some people won't mind this and I don't really interact with people that much but I do like feeling a constant need to improve my equipment to survive against that one jerk who constantly comes back to my house knocking on my door with a shotgun in his hand as he says ""Excuse me but do you mind trading with me? I need some food and I'll give you some bullets for anything you have?"" This makes collecting resources so much more fun because you're going to need to make guns metal doors and walls to stop this guy from breaking in. But on a devoid server you don't encounter those people and on a large server you're just going to be spawn killed by the guy who spawns next to you and then wander aimlessly while you view the 10 000 houses on a empty plain. Animals are rare especially on large servers thanks to the massive deforestation but then again you don't need to hunt in this game right away because you have to try to starve to death. Make a house in a dark cave and never leave your home and never get killed by anything and maybe you might starve to death eventually. Rust wants to be a good game and it can be but there's just a large imbalance between what's on the land and the amount of players. Perhaps if the land was bigger or if resources took a extremely long time to deplete then maybe it could work and people who want to jump into a two week old server can without playing the marching simulator. Rust is not a bad game but to me its a disappointing one. 6/10 (Average)",Rust

2016-02-18,0,0,593,True,Recommended,Great game Ive loved it since legacy and had it since then My only issue is that sometimes patches are released and some people exploit bugs to get into your base and all. Real frustrating when you spend hours making a huge base filled with buffer zones and its just griefed real bad but eh thats not a huge deal Stuff like that should be expected.My real major issue is the damn community has gone to total s &amp t the past several months Hardly anyone nowadays doesnt kill on sight and too many people no life the game waaay too dang much to get insane amounts of resources and C4 to go raiding a fair bit of the people in the server but I digress That is there choice.Then you have the kids who are waaay to young to be playing a game like this who surprizingly if anything are the most crude and foul mouthed of the who lot I dont mean to insult anyone who is of the younger spectrum but I really dont think anyone under 17 should play this game 16 may be just fine but anything before then I dunno maybe parents need to look at what theyre kids are playing instead of glancing at it or something. I just guess I wish there was a more mature community still or servers for more mature players and all Something like that would really pull me back in.I do miss how legacy made you feel though and the Zombies (No no animal ones not those). I think rust should still have zombies in radtowns it was fun and made it more of a challenge for you and the other players to make a radtown runAll in all the game is great and being well done with some awesome updates every now and then that are timed pretty well Community has become the only major issue,Rust

Dayz looks much purdier and the map is probably 3x the current Rust map but not nearly as fun. You're also better off picking it up now while it's in Alpha. You're helping the devs put out a better game in the end and you get to be a part of the end product which is going to blow minds. Buy.,Rust

And rust has automatically ""Deleted"" it self from my computer sometimes i cant even find it in my Library neither in my files. And everytime i drive a boat some weird red text pops up and disconnects me from the server and sometimes the game. Ive also tried uninstalling after experiencing these ""Flaws"" but it wont help and i can't play Rust for the rest of the day. Community Alot of people say that Rust's community is ""Cancer"" i havent experienced any toxic people so far (I guess that's good) I have seen many videos and lifestreams where other in game players are really toxic It kinda puts a bad image for people who are looking to buy rust. I understand that Rust can be very competitive for alot of people but that's not an excuse to be really toxic. (Also ""Naked"" Huntig is kinda cancer) Other then that i think we have a good community Actual active developers and frequent updates and alot of new skins.

2014-01-22,0,0,8,True,Recommended,At the start of the game I was pretty confused about how to survive. But when i understood it ended up being a fun DayZ like game. One of my complaints though is that when you exit the game or disconnect from a server you were playing on it keeps your character in game on the floor as if it's sleeping. And other players can kill you while you offline and take whatever was in your inventory (this also can happen on no pvp servers). That's happened to me a few times and it's very frustrating trying to gain back my progress. If the developers could at least make no pvp servers have that disabled it'd help a lot and keep me playing for a long time. Other than that though this game is greatly made and really fun/time consuming. If I could I'd give Rust a good 7.5/10 rating.,Rust

2017-01-23,0,0,84,True,Not Recommended,Game has a fun concept and i generally enjoyed the survival gameplay a few bugs like bears glitching into your stone base and killing you. But the main downside of the game is the other players quite simply they are c***s. out of about 20 encounters with other players only 2 were friendly everyone else just murders you steals your s*** and trashes your base and sleeping bag so you have to start all over again. It would be best to start afer a server wipe if you want a fair shot at getting going or playing with a group of freinds. But even then if you're fighting off C4 rockets and machine guns with spears and bows you still have bob all hope of getting anywhere in this game would be better as a zombie survival without pvp.,Rust

2017-01-23,0,0,208,True,Recommended,This game is pretty awesome for an Alpha and for the most part its fun to play. I'm relatively new to the game as you can see but I learned a lot through trial and error and my advice to new players who are coming to the game alone that is without running mate(s) would be to find a PVE server or a server that has a low or no population to learn the crafting mechanics because its easier to learn when you're not being killed every 2 minutes as you would on most high population servers. Server wipes are lame. I understand there is some limitation that makes the game itself and wiping is a sort of 'workaround' for now but knowing that doesn't make it easier to swallow losing everything after repeatedly investing hours upon hours gathering and crafting starting again over and over gets tedious. I hope they find a way around this limitation because if wiping becomes an actual part of this game permanently I doubt I'll keep playing.,Rust

People kill you on sight for no reason and don't understand when their servers numbers drop. When you litterally take everything from a person that you don't even need they stop playing. Great job Rust community you lost another player. 1 600 servers and 1 average player on them...EDIT TO POSITIVE REVIEW Alright I spoke too soon I was coming into this game with all the trained years of playing games you have to go in knowing everyone is a hostile you make friends where you can and you make sure you roll with MINIMUM 4 people. The game truly shines when you go raiding. I just wish it was a little more relaxed when it came to farming for gear.,Rust
2017-01-23,0,0,7,True,Not Recommended,This game has so much potential. It was fun for a while then i got spawncamped by a ing wolf. This normally wouldn't be a probelm it ed off after a whie but there is a 5 minute cooldown to respawn at a sleeping bag after you already do so. This also happens to be the exact time it takes for bodies to decay. So I lost all my stuff after specifically getting the item that is supposed to prevent exactly that. This experience completely killed it for me. Other than that the game lacsk content is absolutely awfully optimized and continously crashes. Now I know the game is in alpha but I do not reccomend the game in its current state.,Rust

2017-12-12,0,0,2720,False,Recommended,Devs are finally banning cheaters once you report them that's the only reason i changed my rating to POSITIVE for this game.The game is a masterpiece apart from the BluePrint system which make the game unnecessary too complex if you want to go to sleep in real life but you were the only one who learnt the BP of Explosive &amp Rockets and your clan just brough home a lot of Sulfur you must stay online and craft for them the Rockets because no onelse can do it or if you are getting raided and you didnt learn garage doors or armored door you are going to risk everything just to replace a stupid metal door that can be destroyed with few explosive rounds.However BP have their positive influence on the game slowing down the game progression and expecially snowballing (even if it's not always the case) however even if I personally dislike BPs the game is still a great game with awesome building skills and weapons system the 3D sound is amaizing. Buy it.My previous review (cheaters where in every single server when i wrote my previous review) Wallhack and aimbot in official servers!!!Facepunch the development team doesn't do anything they ban 1% of cheaters.A single player with a semiautomatic rifle killed me and my whole clan people with thousand hours of experience on rust and on some FPS.This was the last time i am quitting today and hope this game will be abandoned soon.WASTING days farming and bulding and then meet a couple of cheaters killing everyone behind cover on prefire hitting just headshots from 100m+This game is PATHETIC.

Rust is a brutal game that's a fact...But even through all of the grind and naked rock battles that plague you no matter where you play rust never ceases to prove itself as one of my favorite games of all time. No other game has ever had me literally sweating after a pvp battle and because rust relies on other players to make up for the lack of npc's there is always something new each time you log on.

2014-01-16,0,0,3897,False,Not Recommended,"This game was amazing one of the best of it's time and some could argue really started the whole naked survival concept you see in games like Conan and SCUM. I have been playing this game for over 5 years off and on back when it was called Rust legacy in a freakin' browser window. This game is unique no doubt a true hardcore survival pitting you against the enviroment animals NPC's and of course other players. Before I get into my rant and review I do want to say one thing that Facepunch has always been great about is their update and content. They used to do weekly updates for over 4 years misses a week here and there but I've never seen that kind of dedication in a very long time. When full release hit it went to monthly updates with a month here or there with nothing really new to show but still overall can't applaud them enough they do it well.Here's where I have a problem and this has been an issue for a long time this is why I'm off and on this game so much. It's very time consuming no matter what you do it'll most likely be a grind. Farming for scrap resources raiding roaming it's all a big grind and if the payout is great it's usually worth it because it turns into a great experience in the end. Maybe some ups and downs but still probably a fun wipe. However like I said it's time consuming and most of us who don't play Rust on the regular have a wife kids job(s) ect... so what gets tricky is trying to compete with people who have just a lot of free time which is no fault to anyone just the way it works.Now the community very toxic and very aggresive. Most of the time you're getting killed for zero purpose. You will get door camped for your loot people will harrass you with music racsim you name it I bet you'll experience this at least half a dozen times if not more in a wipe cycle. It's online gaming though right? It's to be expected. I feel here it's a bit more over the top because you got a game where you grind for hours and someone comes up and kills you or maybe even raids your base all that time is down the drain. And if a person has nothing left in their name or maybe they're just upset from you taking their loot you're going to get very upset teenager. Yes I said teenager which brings me to the 3rd part the population. Like I stated the last two lines the game is time consuming and you have toxic people. Now the population is filled with mostly younger people you will come across people in their late 20's maybe even 30's but it's not very common. This is an aggresive game and incredibly difficult to play by yourself shoot even the developer known as HELK literally said on his own server and I quote &amp quot lonewolves"" but that's another discussion. So of course you're going to try and look for people to play with because this game is hard as hell you got NPC's other players animals (not that hard) and the enviorment it's a difficult game. But you got all these young toxic racist disrespectful people grouping up more and more and more and solo play is nearly out of the question. You have these never ending groups of people who just are rude nearly every play session everyday for as long as you're able to play Rust before you quit because while you were at work a group of kids raided your fragile 2x2.Now I make it sound bad and it is but there are some factors that come into play and can change the outcome like what server you play on is it modded or vanilla is the map small how populated does it get during peak hours stuff like that can make your experience vary.I remember when there were so many community servers and some really cool admins hosting and maybe a group was too big on that server back then it wasn't as common as it is today but it did happen and they were usually known as (whoever group) and most people on the server knew of them or if you didn't you would soon. There were lots of populated really nice servers but now you got this endless list of servers that are super underpopulated I'm talking maybe less than 20 during peak hours the servers that are populated are the sponsored or official servers. The actual official servers on wipe day you're literally waiting hours to get in a game and you better hope you don't disconnect in the queue or you're waiting all over again. Like seriously I'm not waiting freaking 4 hours to play a game that's all my play time right there. So you jump to a less populated server to play and if you're lucky it stays populated for more than 3 4 days then it may die it might not we all have different preferences when it comes to how much PvP/PvE we like to do.All in all it really is a fun game and if you have friends to play it with that'll make the experience better and at least you won't be suffering alone but you have a long way to go before the game gets easier for you it's a long learning curve. Maybe I've just been on this game too long but I'm burnt out. The new content is pretty neat we're getting new guns the boat event is cool there's pictures of hot hair ballons I'm not sure how I feel about that or the direction the game is going but I'll never get sick of building my own base. It's like Minecraft but I get to shotgun people in the face.Thank you for your time and I hope if you do get the game please try to be friendly to others help a noob out. I know it's hard to tell because you hand a naked a hatchet they may just try to kill you which not only makes us hard to trust anyone so we shoot on sight but it makes it hard for new players to get welcomed into the game because we're sick of hearing ""Hey I'm new can you help me"" And when we do help we just get stabbed in the back literally.",Rust

BEFORE THE UPDATES It was extremely fun to playYou could get a base and a waterpipe / revolver in an hour or twoYou could compete in PVP with out too much fear that if you lose your gun you will never get it backIf you got raided it was less damaging because it was easier to pick up steam againAnd it was perfect IMO AFTER UPDATES You can get a base down but after you upgrade it to wood you're stuckYou have to dump ALL your wood / stone into your tool cupboard in order for base to not disappear overnightYou get raided anyways and if you're offline your base is gonna be gone because they destroyed your tool cupboardThe only way to get guns is PVP so if PVP is not your thing ing avoid this gameIn short this game is way too grindy you have to spend hours in order to get a revolver. And even then you get killed by a ing clan roaming with Semis. I regret every hour I put into this game after the blueprint tool cupboard and workbench update.,Rust

This game is hard and it will be challenging to learn and even harder to master I myself have not mastered the game but i'm very keen on doing so. This game brings aspects of Minecraft and Dayz.

2016-08-27,0,0,3134,False,Recommended,In my opinion Rust is one of the greatest games ever made. There is a big learning curve and you will probably make so many mistakes at first that you'll want to eat your own hands but let's make this clear Rust is not a game it's a job. And to be honest it's a damn depressing one at that. The grind is unbelievable and if you don't have 3+ hours to spare every day you'll progress very slowly. But let's say you have 5 6 hours to play everyday you're solo and you get a base up you start to unlock some decent blueprints for better tools weapons and clothes. You'll soon find yourself getting raided by a clan of 3+ players who probably don't even need your meagre loot. The raiders will often block access to your base leaving you to start all over again.The 'solution' for solo players is playing on a modded server where you can collect resources and achieve end game items much quicker. But it's the same thing essentially. Either you build a colossal base which will still take you hours and hours of gathering building and upgrading leaving your opponents unsure of where to start raiding and usually underestimating the amount of explosives required to complete the raid or you get trampled on early by a clan.I really love this piece of game but it's highly toxic doesn't do anything good for the human spirit and it's extremely demanding of your time. There is obviously much more to say about the game but since I've spent almost 3000 hours 'playing' it I'm going to stop right here. Obviously you should check out YT vids to see how this game really goes down and figure out if it's for you. Happy GRINDING!!! D,Rust

People are so ing petty they don't team up with people unless they have like 100 hours or some Meaning you have to endure losing hours to days of work for 100 hours before you even have a chance at being able to keep your this game.

2015-01-11,0,0,3,True,Not Recommended,I want to like this game I really do. The video makes it seem likea an exciting experience of survival and adventure. Sadly the reality is more a less than thrilling experience of being blugeoned to death by other naked men or being gunned down by the handful of players whohave managed to hold onto real weapons. Furthermore food is nearly impossible to come by if I could eat the other players that might would be one thing but at last check canibalism was not an active part of the game. i tried to build myself a shelter in an effort to not die withiin 24 in game hours but quickly found myself over run by other players. Maybe if I could manage to land on a server with very fiew players that had not already been completely occupied by small shacks/houses where I could survive for a few days on my own merrits it would be enjoyable. however I have not been able to accomplish this and do not find the current rendition of game play to be all that fun as once you die and you will you lose everything (provided that you have not been able to build yourself a stash somewhere).,Rust

Or in an act of revenge have them blow your house up with c4. Karma is a b*tch ain't it? Also you might want a friend to tag along with because I found it incredibly hard to be able to progress at all by myself since I was always double or even triple teamed by many players.

2017-06-06,0,0,463,True,Recommended,As the game is not yet complete I will reserve my review until that time.That being said there is something I think people reading reviews of this game should know.In my opinion Rust is the best example of Early Access done right.I've seen so many Early Access games abandoned so many of them a grab for cash to fund another game and even more still that the devs don't listen to the community.Rust is nothing like them. Facepunch has been diligently working at a steady pace for years. They've improved the game so much but more importantly listened to the community when making those improvements.Garry and team have had to deal with the most vitriolic harassing violent fans (Play this game for a few hours on a public server and you'll know what I mean). Yet they've listened to them with respect tried out their suggestions scaled back unpopular ones and communicate with players on social media about their decisions. I believe this alone is worth the purchase price.For people reading this beware of reviews that claim the devs 'broke' the game or made it 'unplayable'. This game does huge updates every month and some players get mad when their 'techniques' (exploits) are nerfed. That is the source of many of these bad reviews. There are some legitimate complaints which Facepunch have always acknowledged and worked to improve.,Rust

The problem is after I make a base and try to collect resources and what not I get raided. Every time I log back on I have nothing left. The grinding elements is fun to work toward getting a better base weapons and armour. The graphics are phenominal. The sound effects are very realistic. Dispite this I cannot play this game without knowing I will loose everything I worked for. Playing with friends may make it a little more enjoyable and may allow you to get farther faster but playing solo has been horrible so far. As a side note the developers decided to add a female character and random facial features just to be politically correct. I would be fine with a female character if I could choose it my self rather than being forced to play as one. Personally I don't mind being a female but the developers missed an opportunity to add character customization and made the game worse instead.

2018-05-29,0,0,537,False,Recommended,Rust makes better use of voice chat than any game I've ever played. You are naked and alone on the world's silliest island. There is no narrator or announcer so instead you submerge in the quietude of the unkempt grass crunching beneath your feet as you uselessly smash your rock against the nearest pine tree. Perhaps you've also harvested some mushrooms and a few bundles of flax enough to stave off the hunger pangs and fashion yourself a burlap shawl to cover your shame. If you're particularly industrious you'll have furnished a nice wooden shack a stone's throw away from some fresh water and reliable resources the entry level homestead necessary for any successful Rust campaign.But then you hear it. Faintly at first. Carried on the tip of the breeze. It's another idiot in Rust. I don't know what it is with this game. Maybe it's the fact that you spawn unclothed and uncensored maybe it's the brutal vastness of the design or maybe it's the simple uncouth joy of doing bad things to other human beings but Rust has a distinctly regressive effect on the human species. The voice chat merges with the draw distance so when you're spotted by an idiot you'll start hearing the talk quietly tickling your ear. They get closer they get louder and more confident and suddenly you're hopping over shotgun shells while absorbing an entire dictionary of insults.,Rust

This game has a very unique community that disgusts you at first but you quickly come to love and understand. If you like PvP then this game is for you. As for the devs working on this game let me put in to you this way the devs have this game that everyone loves but it isn't quite working in the capacity that they envisioned that game to be in. So they go and recreate the game code entirely!!!!! You know the devs are looking out for their game and want it to be the best game they can make it when they undertake such a huge project so that they can make the game the way they've always wanted it. And so that the players could still play a playable version they left the old version up while they remade the new one.

This truly is a sadists game killing other players in a video game has never been so satisfying and rewarding. As a player I've never felt so pressed into being tactical in a video game. This is definitely because I've never wanted to survive so badly in a video game. There aren't many games on the market today that can bring out these raw motivations and incentives.This is the first game I've seen push a grown man to befriend someone through the internet add him on social networks gain his trust only to betray him later just to take all of his virtual possessions and by god I love it.Not many games can drive people to such a level of degeneracy and I hope to see more like this on the market.,Rust

2014-01-26,0,0,227,True,Recommended,I think this is the future of gaming. I hate it but somehow I'm enthralled. Why should I have fun taking my time beating on trees and animals and rocks with the threat of death looming in the background like some a hole laughing from above? But oh wait just as I'm in the middle of farming trying to survive with a piece of chicken that took me forever to aquire I'm suddenly hit on the back of the head by some desperate soul who needed sustenance just as much as I did. I can't blame him even though I despise him. He wanted what I did to survive. In a nut shell that is what this game is about. You begin to learn to protect yourself never trust anyone and never get too comfortable in your situation. Hasn't this been done before in other games? Certainly it has but never with such a feeling of dread a sense of revenge and a motivation to NEVER let the same thing happen to you again. This is Rust and this is more than a game. Or so it seems.,Rust

2014-01-26,0,0,49,True,Recommended,"The way the game is I would recomend that you have friends the already play Rust. Playing this on your own and without anyone to help will increase the difficulty highly. In the first hour of play you would experiance being killed by other players at least once. I can recomend to anyone that does want to play on their own that they choose a Non PvP server to start out or at least be prepared to loose everything you gathered multiple times. Even after my 6 hours of play I though that building a hut with a door would protect my belonging but doors can be destroyed and all your belonging looted. I like this challenge and that is why I recomend it.I would also state that you can ignore the video on Steam stating ""Your First Day in Rust"". As I stated before you will most likly be killed by other players in your first day so crafting a bow a hatchet or a sleeping bag will be come nearly impossible for a while. I will also state the a sleeping bag is highly important as it lets you respawn at that location.Don't give up on this game just yet it is still in Alpha as of writing this.",Rust

2014-01-25,0,0,10,True,Recommended,I know this game is still in Alpha.I played a little here and a little there mostly because I'm trying to find the perfect time to play when the lag issues are the lowest. Other than spending multiple respawns trying to find everything needed to survive I finally did it. I managed to kill a few animals with the rock you start with collect wood and spend an hour trying to find those rare rocks that you need to beat on in order to get stone and metal fragments. The major problem I see is everyone and their brother has to build themselves a shack then they stop playing and these empty abodes are left there on the map causing the servers to build them if and when they restart. If they can manage to fix this issue where you can build yourself a house and never return. Once the lag issues are sorted out the game will be better.Now I play on a PVE server because I'm a whimp like that. Don't hate. It seems the major issue on this server Central 2 is that once you log out you're fair game. People are able to kill you and take your stuff. Which is completely against the whole PVE idea. So I haven't yet been murdered because of this quirk but there are those who log in and fill the chat with their complaints. Another issue to fix? Probably but it shouldn't be the first thing on their list to fix.Now resource spawns or just spawns in general. It seems you spend three hours looking for one item in particular whether it's the stones that give you stone / metal fragments or food. There just doesn't seem to be enough to be beneficial. The most common resource is wood whether in wood piles or the trees themselves. Then there is food if you can risk fighting a bear or wolf without them killing you. When you do find an animal you have to watch out because it is faster than you and will probably bolt at the faintest hint of you or when another player comes running up to try and kill it. On to the stone issue if you spend three hours walking the entire map and don't find a single mineable stone there's a problem. Easy fix? Up the amount that spawn into the map.Overall I'd definitely recommend anyone interested in a multiplayer PVP / PVE zombie survival crafting game to get this. Just be aware that it's in alpha and there is the occasional hacker.,Rust

2014-01-25,0,0,159,True,Not Recommended,"Well the game is very fun to play. I like building my house/keep together with a few good friends. We send out parties hunting for food materials and tech. We also go on raids where we break into peoples homes and take their stuff. Also the adrenalin when you are chasing a aidrop is awsome with often fierce firefights breaking out over them. There are a few bugs but nothing really major (it really feels like a complete game in many regards)The reason i do not reccomend the game at this time are as follows 1 Balance There is no balance between raiders and builders. It is easier to raid/murder compared to building/farming and usually you gain enough materials from the raid to continue making c4 (often you get c4 from the residents to so the cost of raiding is not as high as some people would claim. Unless you hit a dummy house with nothing in it and just spent 15c4 on it) Last wipe we got the tech early and raided 3 5 houses (poorly built to be true but still) No problems in get 10 c4 on the first day (we lucked out with airdrop) The lack of defence means you have to hide your stuff and not build a big houses. The successfull people walk 10 15minutes into the wasteland to build and then spend their time transporting materials and raiding others. Personally i hate that much walking and i cant believe that this is what the game is about. This is the major breaking point for me there needs to be ways to defend the base there need to be room for raider builder and the ones in between. I do everything in the game i farm i build i raid and when on raid i will murder people who are farming for their materials. Just so you dont think this is a builder whining about being raided. I also sometimes help fellow rustians that i encounter on farming trips. Unless i have gear of value on me then its safer to shoot them first and find out if they are armed second 2 Hackers yes there are a few of them out there even if you are on a server with good admins3 Admins some servers have bad admins that abuse their powers (my last server was good in this regard but it can be really hard to find the ""right"" home)4 If you are a peacloving builder you need to keep in mind that most people will shoot you on sight or beat you with their stone axe whatever. Personally i do not mind this as i love player vs player. I try to not kill kill everybody i see but after being killed x amount of times by nude people hiding shotguns up their private parts i now tend to shoot everyone who gets to close to me (nude or not)5 Addition to 4 Your house WILL be raided. Does not matter if you have a 8x8 structure with all metaldoors instead of walls. You will not be able to prevent this because the raiders stay up at night to take your house when you are sleeping. If you join the server after 3 4days after a wipe there are raiders running around with 50 100c4 chain raiding houses. The good news is that your big house is usually safe during the day when you are up because the hardcore raiders do not want to risk losing a ton of c4 to defenders. I have been raided once while online and i was away on my own raid at the time. We got back and killed the raider as he left our house (thanks for the kevlar guy) D So online good chance of defending your loot. Bad news You need sleep school work you will be raided when you get back! (Our big house gets raided every night so do our neigbours and we live a fair walk away from the road/settlements)Some people 15min walk from us made 4 houses by the road we were spying on them to determin where they put most of their loot They had two big towers with lots of doors and one metal house(3 stories high) and a small house close by. Day 3 after wipe they were all raided. Every door every storage box every sleeping bag destroyed I know because i went there looking to raid and someone had beaten me to it (I would have been able to get maybe 30% 40% into one of the houses. That someone else had c4 to blow EVERYTHING is just mind boggeling)",Rust

2014-01-26,0,0,46,True,Recommended,I would really recommend Rust to the people whom enjoyed Minecraft and DayZ. As we all have heard There are a lot of bugs and hackers in the game. But consider this... It's a game in the Alpha Stage not everything will be perfect at this point in time. I didn't buy this game not knowing what I was in for I knew about the hackers I knew about the bugs. I bought the game for the amazing potential it has.Rule of thumb when buying alpha game Look away from the negative (Not everything will be perfect).

Rust/New Rust vs Original Rust/Old Rust/Legacy I would say that the new and encumbent version is the new rust. It has better graphics and is the one the devs want to support moving forward. However although it may in essence be a better game in terms of its physics and visuals I do not believe that it gives the player the same level of grittiness in the overall experience. Original Rust made my heart literally jump on at least several occasions in a way that not many games can actually do. We can be talking sheer terror it's great. Then there are the sniper fights. Window to window in metal bases with boltys. First time you do that is a buzz. I think if it came down to it everyone would prefer the old game but only if they'd have made a few more maps.... Buy the game and play the old version before the new one. You get both versions anyway so you can choose which one to play any time you log in so it's all good. Just buy it I say. ) There's no rust for the wicked.Rust in peace.Eat my rust.,Rust

2016-03-10,0,0,18,True,Not Recommended,Won't lie. It's a pretty game. I enjoyed running through the lush landscape and hunting was pretty fun too once you got the hang of using the bow. Building a base up from nothing epecially with a friend or two is fun. Watching that little shack you two developed from hours of farming materials feels nice like in any game with a building and crafting system... and then you log back in the next day to see all that hard work flung out the window because someone decided to pay you a house visit and commandeered all your hard earned mats. I've got nothing against the game itself. I quite enjoy it. My gripe is with the people who get way too thirsty for blood. New to the game? Nothing good on you? Don't want to fight? Too bad. They will kill you without a second thought. And that house that you worked hard to build that is storing all the mats you spent hours to farm? Expect that to be gone everytime you log off and log back on hours later.This game is still in its early stages so I'm hoping in the future they add something to better protect your buildings that you've spent hours on or at least an option to host a private server. Until then if you're looking for a game with an open world enviroment and crafting system I don't recommend this game unless you don't mind the PvP. Or at least play it with a bunch of friends.,Rust

2018-06-19,0,0,693,False,Recommended,"This is a long oneTLDR at the bottomRust is a game like no other. I first played on legacy years back and I vividly remember my first thought after loading in to the server being ""What the are these graphics"". For the time they were bad but the game captured me and it was with the large open world quantity of players and its very steep gunplay learning curve. When I had my first gun I thought I was the dogs balls and now one could mess with me. This was until I opened the door to my base and got one bombed by a guy in full kevlar with a shotgun. After rinsing and repeating this annoying cycle I decided to stop playing the game. Not a bad first experience but not the worst.Now I would just like to take this moment to say I believe Facepunch Studios are the best devs around and will continue to be for a long while they listen to the comminity and tell the community what their plans for the game is. Just look at the Facepunch blog and road map the sheer amount of planned content is preposterous yet achievable as they have proved time and time again. Tripple A devs need to take a page out of this book.When I heard that they were REMAKING Rust my first thoughts where ""Oh great now I have to pay for a game I already have"" but no. They decided after working on legacy for over a year. ""You know what I'm not really happy with the game so it LETS SCRAP EVERYTHING WE HAVE DONE SO FAR and make a new game for them to play that they will enjoy more"". I dont know about you but I think any other group of developers would have let the game stay as it is after being blinded by the number of sales the game got. Hats off to Facepunch.When the NEW Rust first came around I was sceptical about many things. Questions like ""Have they bitten off more than they can chew?"" ""Why is a deer chilling at the bottom of this lake?"" started to arise as I fist dabbled in this uncharted territory of bugs abusable game mechanics. But I gave the game time and so did the devs and over the years they have crafted what I see to be thee best example of an early access game being sucessful and achieving its potential as a game. I don't really wanna call it a survival game as the base necessities of survival are not really as important as they should be (food drink temperature etc.) This is something that I believe the devs will fix over time. But if you can look over that at the core this game is a masterpiece.Additionally I have met so many people that have become friends throught Rust so heres short story about a guy named TH Dog. I have no idea how long ago this was but it was when the Leveling system was first implemented.&gt Building a base on a rock&gt See a guy building near me on a river&gt Approach cautiously with my bow&gt Say ""Hello!""&gt He sees me and draws his bow&gt Imaboutdomeafella.jpg&gt He talks ""Hey man you friendly?""&gt Exchange base locations and become neighbours&gt Go back to building my base&gt Hear the pitter patter of about 4 guys run past my base&gt Realise they are heading towards my neighbour&gt Hear the sad sound of explosions wasted on this lootless base that this man had constructed&gt Everything settles&gt Carry on building my base&gt Hear a pitter patter of a neked&gt Hear ""Hey man I was your neighbour but I got raided""&gt I often think about this moment as it is what really started this friendship. I broke a rule of Rust. I let him in my base and let him duo with me as I felt bad for him he had access to all of my I think anyone else would have ed me over but not this guy. We ended up dominating our area until the end of the wipe.&gt I don't think I'd give anyone that chance again as I'd most likely get ed over. I feel like the decision of letting this man in was made by my young naive brain&gt Still play with Dog to this dayTLDR 9/10 Worth a buy even at full price a sale is just god send Best played with friends still fun as a solo player tho Good combat and building mechanics Best devs around that actually care about games and listen to the community If you hate PvP this game is not for you If you love it hehe Ill see you in 300 hours If they are not your friend they are hostile You will get frustrated when you have been raided As a new player you will find it hard to grasp the complexitys of the game in terms of macro and micro I recommend playing with someone who knows what they are doing.

Modded servers however are quite fun as in a lot of them the gathering rate is increased and you don't have to put all of your time into the game to get started.

2014-01-27,0,0,8,True,Not Recommended,The game is currently not ready for prime time. I know it is an alpha but the game is just not fun. The graphics are pretty but the gameplay is very very very basic. The crafting is simple to say the least. The process for how resources are gathered needs to be re thought. It is way too hard to gather stone. I spend most of my time running around just trying to find the correct stone outcropping so I could gather some. Plus if you actually make any progress in the game the servers keep on updating and wiping your progress. The game is also plagued by hackers and griefers. On a PvP server you will be sniped by flying players before you even have enough to craft a bow and arrow. You can also be killed while offline and have your inventory taken even on non PvP servers. Dont waste your time on this yet. It may evolve into a fun game someday but for now save your $20!,Rust

2013-12-26,0,0,65,True,Recommended,I'd recommend it this game if you can handle PvP and some obvious graphical issues. This is an Alpha but I consider it an investment. In terms of gameplay it's not groundbreaking unique but its quite entertaining and rewarding to play.Playing multiplayer is expected and your interactions with people will either make/break this game.I wouldn't take this game too seriously. You ARE going to find really rare items and you WILL be killed trying to return to your shelter. That's just the game though.As an aside there are some PvE servers but I've not tested them.,Rust

2017-02-15,0,0,1146,True,Recommended,Ok Ill admit it took me a while to get the swing of this game. But now that I've had a chance to dig in I really like it. It's going to you off. Your going to meet people you would rather not know. But there are servers full of people that will help you figure it out. A few hints to help out new nakeds. Don't run up to anyone and expect not to get shot. If you see someone lock eyes and jump once. If they jump to then you should be safe to try and talk. This does not mean you won't be shot but it's a kind of etiquette. Don't build to close to monuments you'll get raided quick. Try to talk to people befor you build to close to another base. Dig around for a server and try to find one thats relitivly calm. By this I mean find one without chat fighting or little kids running around being racial and loud. Try player servers rather then official. Your going to get killed no matter how nice the server is build yourself a sleeping bag befor you build a base. When farming for recorces it can help to make a small stash and bury your haul near where your farming. This way if people hone in on the noise you make and shoot you in the back you'll still have a little of what you farmed hidden near by. Turrets can be turned against the owner place accordingly. I just started getting into this game so if you need a safe place to get a start hit me up in game and I'll help if I can. I don't KOS. I'll useually give the other player a chance to make a move first. It gets me killed allot. But you play the way you enjoy or run the risk of becomeing one of the tinpot teenage server dictators that frequent this game.,Rust

2015-12-31,0,0,1911,False,Recommended,I am editing this review for RUST. My first review was rough because of the problem the game had early on with hackers. Although hackers are still an issue I think the game has come such a long way since I first started playing that I think it deserves a new review. This is a great game. I think as far as the survival genre goes this game is one of the best. It is worth doing some research into what server to play on because in this game community is extremely important even if you plan to play solo. At first I hated that at anytime someone could kill me and take all my stuff or destroy a base I spent hours building. But the adrenaline you get from trying to defend your base and then the rage you feel after you are overwhelmed Mixed with the satisfaction that comes from getting revenge is a recipe for an incredibly engaging game.,Rust

2016-03-17,0,0,3,True,Not Recommended,Never got out of early access like most Steam games. The game itself was alright but it suffers from the same problems as every other open world survival game. Community is mostly jerks who will either kill you or take your stuff as soon as you log off. These games aren't for people with a life outside of gaming. Crafting and stuff is good but if you really want the experience of getting screwed over after hours of grinding go play the newest *insert early access survival crafting game here*,Rust
2016-03-17,0,0,2749,True,Recommended,It's an FPS with a purpose. It means something to lose your gear and your guns. You can play real military tactics using the terrain. The game has so many changes of pace that you will never be bored of the action. Great job by Garry and his team so far.,Rust

2016-03-17,0,0,1247,True,Recommended,The development of this game is constantly underway with new items and fixes added often. I know some friends who tried this game when it released it's not the same game now ! Great game I highly reccomend trying the oxide servers the mod is less time consuming for players and much more fun. From hosting my own server to admin on other servers I've tried all aspects of this multiplayer game it's pure genius. Absolutely highly reccomend ! This is not call of duty you have to think strategize and be willing to adapt quickly to situations it's incredibly challenging and the best fun.,Rust

2015-12-31,0,0,1055,False,Recommended,The game is amazing and you should definetely get it but you should also have some nerves for it. If you can't stick to it at it's worst you don't deserve it at it's best. The game itself is fun after all optimizations i can run it well gives a huge degree of freedom which makes it so fun. Instead of making a decent review I'll just explain why people give it a negative review right now.I KEEP GETTING KILLED BY PEOPLE WITH AK S!The game has came out of EA and a lot of fresh players are running into it and find themselves fckd over and over agian by people with gear. This indeed is Rust so get over it if you want to have fun. They dont get hiding while being weak is a part of the game as nobody wants a naked next door growing into a potential threat.PEOPLE ARE TOXIC!Why do people keep leaving negative reviews saying this? You're reviewing the game not it's community! I mean I often find non toxic people and have pretty funny encounters which is one of most memmorable things in rust. Maybe you're just unlucky and even if people are toxic you're forggeting the fact that Rust isn't about being all nice.THE GAME ISN'T NOOB FRIENDLY!As someone who played quite a bit of it I can agree my first days felt like going naked down a slide of razor blades balls forward but that's the whole beauty of Rust it makes you know it won't be easy. After a couple of tries you can get your base up and running. If you're not sure youre doing something right the internet is your best friend. There are a lot of videos online telling you what should you do in order to survive solo.OPTIMIZATION IS GARBAGE!Sorry cant hear you over my 100 FPS on my dated aids AMD setup. Yes I am running it on lowest but mostly because I don't want any possibility of a lagspike happening mid combat. As the 1.0 released the peformance was garbage for me but they improved it alot. Now it feels like playing a game and not flying trough a power point presentation really fast.TL DR Rust is an amazing game it will be rough sometimes but as you play you learn to do things right and avoid getting fkd all the time and the game gets hella more rewarding as you learn to play it.,Rust

2018-06-27,0,0,61,False,Not Recommended,This honestly is a great game but there are so many hackers that ruin it and literally make it impossible for new players. Even if you get into a server with no hackers there's still the people who farm new players and make it pointless to even try to build anything or loot anything. Spent a good 5+ hours trying to get steady and have someone either fly by or AK my group while we have spears and bows then loot everything we had. No point in attempting to play after you die in your home because you'll already be expecting them to take anything and everything of value.,Rust

2018-09-02,0,0,535,False,Recommended,"Honestly loved this game years ago. Never played legacy much but enough to fall in love with this game in 2013. the Unitiy 5 engine and graphic change in 2014 was nice but could never figure out how to change my gender from female every time since was never a big deal to me could have YouTubed it I suppose if it truly made it a difference to me. I did not enjoy when they took away the Blue Print system and made it more of exp like Ark That was a huge let down. when the took the exp away and brought the BP's back I was stoked. Oh how I remeber when They first added The Helicopter omg was that a blast with huge zergs fighting eachothers. ZFG and DMG on rustopia where huge clans that honestly put up great firefights. man oh man Rustopia was an awesome server really KOS ""kill on sight"" Jan 2018 is when I played last. Always was a KOS server but more crazy now I feel. Loved the airfields for great action. Have yet to come back to rust since about the beginning of this year 2018 and feel ashamed not having played the game since they actually full released in Feb. Man I didn't think facepunch would ever finish this game lol. Over all great game would recommend 10/10 GG no Zzz. One will never sleep once the get the Rust flu XD Have made some great friends from this game Thank you FacePunch! every game has it's down falls hard to stop turds from being turds and keep them from hacking. Face punch did a better job with their anti cheat then Counter Strike Global Offensive I feel P my favorite memory of the game was when they added Optics. A lot of us would stay up late at night crafting gunpowder ammo explosives you name it we where preparing for WAR preparing for that next day of raids battle and glory. We would sit around a camp fire enjoying the pleasures of calories converse about the game exchanging our hypotheses of how rust would change and would always talk about how cool it would be for them to add optics for the guns. we all loved the bolty but man how we all would tower camp/snipe others doing the same camping in their towers sniping others oh the joy. Shoot the M249 was a beast with a scope. Need to give this game some more hours of my life to feel like this was a good review. From my experience of growing with the game I totally enjoyed it. Hate to not be able to give my opinion on how the game is finalized but can tell you that I truly enjoyed the game when I played last. I love all of you Nerds!(Edited for spelling errors. I'm sure there is more.) &lt 3 Medi",Rust
2018-06-10,0,0,1375,False,Recommended,So Rust.What an interesting game must I say. Pros It's fun. Very fun. Every server you play on is a completely different experience. Lots of things to do. The PvP aspect of the game is by far the best PvP experience than any game out there. (FPS) Most of the popular servers have active and unbiased admins. Of course there's always those asscracks though. Learning how to use guns isnt easy and I kind of appreciate that. (Mostly talking about the AK 47) Running Rad Towns is actually enjoyable.Cons The Community. Its literally terrible. Lots and lots of toxic people no matter what server you choose to play on. Getting Offlined is EXTREMELY frustrating and demotivating. Imagine playing for 12 hours one day just to log on the next day and everything you worked for was taken from you without your choice of defending it. Clans. I typically don't mind them since I play in them but I do understand why a lot of people don't like them. Not really for casual gamers. Theres a lot of grinding but you can play for 2 hours one day and get off. Just don't expect to get much done in those two hours.Overall 6/10. The game is still in the early works and could use a lot of work.,Rust

The good half of the community is gone.. now all that is left are kids cheaters nazis racists 20 man groups etc. The commuity/youtubers are to blame for how toxic this game became. All eveyone wants to do is pull off ""plays"" like their favorite youtuber. No one talks or interacts anymore. The survival aspects are a complete joke optimazation is bad this game should still be in early access or atleast a beta because thats how it runs and that how it feels like to play.",Rust

2018-09-02,0,0,48,False,Recommended,"I have always enjoyed Rust since its early days. I have operated numerous servers for the game for the online fan base experience. It is something rather enjoyable with others can get a bit lonesome if alone.Dedicated custom servers are handy for this game since I feel the supply rate of materials is deeply hindered in the official servers. I would think it takes ages to get things built at the low rate of supplies. Luckily custom modded servers exist to boost resource in take. The developers have obviously offered to help create a game that allows the fan base to add to it themselves via custom servers. That shows attention to its customers. Don't always see this in other games.I will however have to add that the Legacy version of the game is still my favorite. I do hope one day vehicles show up in the game because it is a long walk sometimes. I would have thought by now they would have added such enhancements since the game has been around so long. There is a mod for servers to allow a ""scrap helicopter"" but its very glitchy in terms of operation since its not game support exactly. The PVP of the game can be brutal. Most of the time its just a game of who can win the gun fight instead of a ""Are you friendly!?"" I would recommend modded servers over official servers as well. Not so much because of their enhancements to the game but for the extra admin support you do not find in official servers. The game has a lot of problem players so I would suggest admin operated servers. In summary Get some friends together. Maybe rent a server or find a nice quiet place to play and start gathering and building. The game offers a lot and has made a lot of great changes in the time since release. I would certainly suggest checking this out if you haven't already.",Rust

2014-01-29,0,0,465,True,Recommended,This game is fantastic. The learning curve isn't steep and you can get up and running fairly quickly.

2013-12-31,0,0,114,True,Recommended,Rust is very much like a combination of Minecraft and games such as Infestation Survivor Stories. It has moderatly good graphics for a game in early alpha with gameplay that is just as good if not better. The community can be unforgiving but there are PVE servers for new comers to these types of games. While the game could still use some improvement it is still solid enough to purchase now and begin playing.Pros *Crafting system is easy to use and gathering is just as easy.*Controls are simple and easy to learn as well as customize*Graphics are good for a game in early alpha*PVE and PVP servers to accomidate every type of gamer from casual to the hardcoreCons *No way to really tell where you are on the map so easy to get lost*Community on PVP servers are very unforgiving and will not hesitate to kill players that have literally just spawned*Spawning into the game if you dont have a 'camp' can spawn you in the middle of various PVE creatures as well as PVP players.The game has its ups and downs but all in all is very solid and is still a work in progress.

Game is a pretty big grind however and you'll have to pour hours into it to get anywhere.Solo play isn't much fun as Rust is definitely easier for groups but there are plenty of solo/duo/trio servers if you don't have anyone to play with.Don't recommend for casual gamers looking for a survival experience.

2015-01-31,0,0,57,True,Not Recommended,The basic premise of the game is good I like where it's going. The community is wretched they're terrible soulless bastards that's part of the game's charm. The non cheating sociopaths in this game are the best part.Given that it's alpha (and probably never going to be 'released') I can look past the terrible UI the terrible graphics the terrible sound the shallow gameplay and the very many nonsensical game mechanics. The game has two major shortcomings the developer lacks the technical skill to address egregiously incompetent network code and a complete absence of server side validation. At least I hope there's no attempt at server side validation yet because if they're is an attempt at it then development of this title is in even worse shape than it seems.More content and a less pathetic UI mean nothing if the game is unplayable due to server side lag and unchecked cheating. These are core issues that have to be addressed early in a game half assing them in later won't work well and if they're not halfway decent by now don't expect them to get better later.Rust is backed by a good idea but this idea needs to be executed on by competent developers. I don't regret dropping $20 to check it out it's like paying to watch a terrible movie with a good premise. My only concern with this game is that the terrible execution of this game will turn off gamers to survival games and harm a emerging genre I happen to like. Gamers would be better off if this project was trashed and somebody who knows what they're doing gave it a shot instead.It's interesting for a couple of days although it will never be a legitmately playable game,Rust

2015-03-11,0,0,45,True,Recommended,Been playing this game since before it looked anywhere near this good. It's clearly nowhere near a finished game yet but I love the content that's available so far. Survival crafting is fun and mostly inuitive. Can be difficult to start out. Despite this the gameplay is very addictive. I would consider it an emmersive experience. Seeing another person gets your adrenaline pumping as you try to figure out if he's going to kill you or if he's just trying to survive too.,Rust
2014-02-01,0,0,3,True,Not Recommended,While this game looks great and lives upto expectations the bad side of this game would have to be that theres too many griefers looters and other people that just seem to enjoy killing you every 5 minutes making this more stressfull than it has to be.and quite frankly not worth playing unless you can make a private server or a lan server with a couple of friends.wich might be implemented later hopefully.on the side of recommending it to friends probally a no unless you enjoy being killed and ganked every 5 minutes and listening to some taunting over voice.,Rust

2016-01-22,0,0,291,True,Not Recommended,Alright so I popped in Rust here a couple days ago. Learned what i was doing and got pretty good at it. Spent 10 hours on a base. had every thing sealed off. Had a bunch of item crates with loot in them (about 10) had 4 furnaces going. Pretty decent for just me (my buddy joined me later). Had an amazing base best walls floors ceilings and doors with key code access. Made a tunnel or a maze like pattern involving numerous numerous armored doors all with different codes to the doors. only 1 way in and 1 way out. Had a huge stockpile of weapons and ammunition. I was having a blast. I finally got the hang of the game really well. Was working on some blue prints for weapons and ammunition. Everything was great. No mistakes. I was just outside the base mining some metal ore and stones when i got shot with a pistol. So i fled back to my home my safe place.Now. Reader discretion is advised. If you are under 18 I strongly suggest you discontinue reading from this point forward. So i made it back into my base. All doors locked. And i heard them running around outside it was two of them. Their footsteps heavy. i heard some pistol shots sound like it came from the 6 shot revolver heard 2 shots checked my Armored walls and saw they had full health and laughed. Then something happened. THESE MOTHER F&amp %$#'S TELEF#%$ING MOTHER F% $ING INTO MY MOTHER F%$#ING HOUSE AND F&amp %#ING KILLED ME. 15 F%$#ING HOURS OF BUILDING AND HARVESTING JUST DOWN THE C#$% SUCKING DRAIN BECAUSE OF SOME F%$#ING HACKS I DIDNT EVEN KNOW ABOUT......Okay sorry about that. I just composed myself. I had a ton of fun looting and building and harvesting and fighting people. Earning my way up to where I was until this happened. Now.. Im done forever. Super fun game if you're learning how to do everything. UNINSTALLED 13/10 Would UNINSTALL again. That is all.,Rust

2016-01-22,0,0,128,True,Not Recommended,This is a Trolling and Griefing game that is meant for adults not kids!I have likes and dislikes about this game Major dislikes!Likes you can build whatever you want and almost wherever you like you can make something kind of like an alliance you can hunt mine craft learn and more and it almost looks like real life.Dislikes you get endlessly murdered trolled and griefed you can't tame wolves at all there can be full on wars can find absolutely no respect to and from people the animals (horses deer wolves chickens pigs and bears) can go through your house and other objects (floors walls defenses (sometimes trees and rocks)) hackers/admins and as nice as you are/act to people most WILL kill you plus the anti cheat software that you have to install to play the game... DOES NOT WORK!!!p.s. I don't know how to rate this game or recommend/or not to people so I put No. PLEASE leave comments on this review...,Rust
2016-01-22,0,0,2696,True,Recommended,Very addictive and very time consuming. Only purchase if this is the only game you want to play for awhile. Whether you are online or offline you are always vulnerable. This game can be very unforgiving but if you are good enough at if very rewarding. The PVP and raiding of other people fortresses are the cornerstone of the game so if you get salty over loosing you stuff or getting griefed this is not the game for you and you should go back to minecraft. 9/10 would waste my life playing this game.,Rust

2016-01-22,0,0,3751,True,Recommended,"This game is amazing. You can pretty much do anything you want but the hardcore world that is rust will try it's hardest to prevent you from doing so. Nearly everything is player based and you're own progress is based on how sneaky or diplomatic you can be... With that being said regardless of how hard you try there's always the possibility of the evil of man. Or the evil in you.I learned very quickly that when all you have is a rock it's better to have two so seeing a naked person smashing the face of another isn't that uncommon. Surely most players are out for number 1 but there are a few ""safe zones"" that if you can comply to not being a complete scoundrel you may get the pass of living along side some rugged bastards just trying to amass as much wall weapons and resources to take on an army of loot thirsty raiders. If you're just trying this game for the first time all I can say is only the patient survive. And try not to end up being someone's slave!",Rust

2013-12-31,0,0,48,True,Not Recommended,This game was a waste of money. You spend countless hours building and building. You make a nice house you get lots of resouces. You make some friends. Then you need to eventually goto sleep. Someone comes to your place kills you takes all of your stuff and ruins your house. You then spawn in the middle of no place with no map no idea where the heck you are and you attempt to start over. You spend countless hours gathering resouces and you may even raid some peoples places. You get cool stuff and you will eventually leave your game. You then wake up and all your stuff is gone. Someone had once again murdered you taken everything and ruined your house. If your lucky they do it while your sleeping. Alot of the times 10+ guys will roam up you you while gathering and while your at home cooking and they blow your door off and murder you take all your hard work and your once again left with absolutly nothing for your time. Its once of the dumbest games i have played. The more people on the server the faster you die. People will kill you on site. Even naked with only a rock you will be murdered cussed at via the games ingame voip. Please avoid this game at all costs. Its only fun for a small time.,Rust

I just didn't find the experience worth the hours/days/months of effort .. i'd rather live in the real worldi may revisit it in the future but probably only when it's finished .. it is great example of the type of people you'll meet in this world and why we are all doomed in the end,Rust

The whole map takes about 30 minutes to run from one end to the other as well as north and south. right now only about 1/10th of the map has actual playing items but expect more in the near future.

The game itself is full of glitches and bugs and incredibly unstable. Although this version of the game is complete garbage my friends and I still have fun playing the game. 8/10Rust 2.0Rust 2.0 is an improvement from legacy. It has a lot to offer and is constantly being updated and improved. The PVP aspect to the game still needs a lot of work but the PVE aspect of the game is excellent and immersive.

2016-04-14,0,0,1108,True,Recommended,"I love Rust! I've been playing Rust since the original version and man its come a LONG way. I love how well Rust immerses you into the world that is Rust. You will wake up naked on a beach and quickly start to feel comfortable as you are captivated by the beautiful enviornment in which you have awoken to. Before you know it you'll encounter one of the other players and soon you'll be fleeing for your life as a player or two are chasing you with guns as you run naked and helpless across the landscape. Thats the normal welcoming event that most players will experience. Once that happens you'll soon find yourself startled by every sound and every little bit of movement. On another note I enjoy the building aspect thats apart of this first person shooter it adds another challenge to a style of game that can get redundant. Don't get me wrong though Rust is all about building raiding stealing ambushing pillaging and plundering. Its a game for people who can think and act like a pirate. This game requires tough skin because you'll log off one night resource rich with all the weapons in the world and log on to find a few holes blown into the side of your base and all your item boxes empty.

2017-05-20,0,0,154,True,Recommended,This probably the most toxic game community you'll ever experience. It will be hard on you annoy you and drive you ing crazy. But at the end you'll see that all the hours you've spent within it were fun. No matter how many times you died how many times you got raided or how many salty encounters you had. At the end of the day the community is key to the best part of the game fun.EDIT As soon as I finished writing this review I hopped on the server to find that I had been raided and died. I talked to the raider we made a deal started working together and now we both have even more than I did before the raid. That's how good this game is.,Rust

2013-12-30,0,0,42,True,Recommended,Its a very interesting game and very fun to play although currently there is quitealot of lag issues within the game they should be sorted very soon (I think the lag issues are due to some DDOSing) the learning curve is quite steep but once you get the hang of it you can do almost anything the graphics engine within the game is stunning and visually pleasing although the long grass within the game that causes lag CAN be disabled!

2013-12-30,0,0,690,True,Recommended,Rust is a mix out of DayZ and Minecraft I like the idea of an open world and the possibility of building your base / house wherever you want. The only disadvantage of Rust is that there are too many hackers (even on the official servers!!!) who can e.g. kill you trough walls with headshots etc.In my opinion Rust is a fun game and worth buying for its cheap price right now!But keep in mind that you'll often die due to hackers!,Rust

2013-12-30,0,0,39,True,Recommended,Whilst it's still clearly an alpha Rust shows much the same promise and appeal of Minecraft Garry's mod (or countless other sandbox environments/games). The beauty of Rust for me is observing human behaviour and how my own behaviour changes within the game world Someone's running towards me do I greet them? flee? Shoot to kill? Should I live out my days in the woods with the bears or should I group together with others and form a community/township? Maybe the world needs a roving gang of thugs pillaging the other players towns?Freedom is the greatest gift and greatest risk in any game.,Rust

2013-12-30,0,0,8,True,Recommended,I recommend this game ONLY if you are patient enough to wait for all the updates to settle in. This game isn't exactly very fun at its current stage in my opinion. There's not a whole lot I've discovered you can do and for me it takes forever to load a game because every server wants to load at once at the main menu which pretty much allows you to do nothing while you impatiently wait for the servers to load. Apart from that this game does seem to have a LOT of potential.,Rust

2018-08-11,0,0,17,False,Not Recommended,Game has a good premise and has promise if it weren't held back by one major issue.... The community. The community is largely a bunch of toxic kids who love nothing more than to kill you and get the satifaction that there is nothing you can do about it especially if they are dedicated players. You start with nothing but a torch and a rock and you will get aquanted with this fact frequently cause when the other players kill you you will be reduced to this state. You may wonder how can they kill me when I'm offline? Well this game doesn't log you off your character merely goes to sleep leaving you defenseless when off server. So do not be surprised when you re log with a death cap. It was fun at first tbh but seeing a death screen repeatedly and starting over just wears you down and you just question why you wasted sooo much time for nothing.,Rust
2018-05-17,0,0,538,False,Recommended,Really good survival game Continual addition of new content lack of admins on main servers invite a lot of cheaters however most community servers are quite good.

2014-01-31,0,0,0,True,Not Recommended,"As of right now the Mac version doesn't work at all. I understand your game is in Alpha &amp that means things won't work 100% but I believe a developer should only release their games on the platforms they're designing for if they can at least function as a game. I understand if maybe animations or like a zombie bugs out I understand that.But when you release a game on a platform that doesn't even work there's something wrong there. I'm sick &amp tired of Mac players being ridiculed &amp treated like second rate players who aren't given attention to their version. I paid $20 for a game that basically just freezes up my Mac &amp causes me to shut down my computer because everything stops working.Look I'm sure RUST is a fine game &amp if it were working I could actually play it I would. But this practice of releasing a game before it's ready KNOWING it won't even work for players is garbage. You cheated me out of my money &amp didn't even deliver a product that functions in any capacity. Again I understand there will be bugs &amp this isn't official release but it should at least be playable enough that Mac players can at least run around &amp interact with the environment. Not ""Start A Game"" then have everything freeze &amp cause unneeded frustration. This is why I'm a console gamer first so I don't have to deal with this shoddy execution. Give me a refund please.",Rust
2014-01-31,0,0,4,True,Not Recommended,This game is unplayable if you are newcomer. Official servers full with hackers and you die 30 times in one hour. It's the same in modded servers just less hacker and maybe you can live 20 minutes before you met someone. I know this game is only alpha but don't worth the money if you wan't have fun. If you like to gather something and lose it 10 minute later than that's your game! But if not just stay away! If you give it a try don't care about the refund becouse it's an early access game. Have a fun guys and spend your money for a better game. Or just throw it into the bin becouse it's the same.,Rust

2014-01-31,0,0,66,True,Recommended,This game for an alpha can get repetitive. It's very brutal when you start out and you can die quite fast to either wildlife annoying zombies or players who just have no sense to help a naked man. However once you get past this and build yourself a hut it gets progressively easier. I enjoyed this alpha game so far as I like building and creating large bases that I have to maintain and build and make sure no one breaks into it. Building massive forts with spike wall defences to keep people from getting inside.I definitely recommend this game for people who want to see it update with more items in the future. It's got a ton of potential especially when they remove zombies and replace them with different AI.,Rust

2014-02-01,0,0,51,True,Recommended,Very fun game! This is one I recomend you buy it now. It is in PRE ALPHA!!! So the d bags that say this game isnt worth your time because of lack of content or nothing to do should be ignored. There is a lot to do especially if you find a couple people to group up and play with. Not as fun of a game solo but it will become a lot more appealing to solo survivors in the coming patches. PvP is fun but be aware this game has issues with cheaters. I recommend you find a modded server with active admins and whitelisting enabled. Pick it up especially on sale. You will have fun now and even more fun in the future.,Rust

2015-10-01,0,0,337,True,Recommended,While the concept of the game is excellent a lot of developmental resources are going towards adding new content over adjusting the base game to operate in a remotely stable state. Yes this is an early access alpha game but it had already passed the legacy alpha and moved to be experimental alpha. It could do a lot of good to target major gameplay issues to make a more fluid game experience instead of dreading the first thursday of the month wipe bug day or the bi monthly patch bugfest.Overall it is worth buying.,Rust
2016-04-19,0,0,41,True,Recommended,Like the game but the servers need a little bit work on as a fresh man on a map you hardly find space to build if you just started playing on a server with over 50 people which can be annoying but apart from that it's a greate game.,Rust

2016-02-21,0,0,390,True,Not Recommended,as an avid rust player of over 200 hours I absolutely love this game and what its about. Ive been playing since day one release all the way up until today. this game is brutal and unforgiving not for the feint of heart by any means. If you're able to look past that you will have the most exhilirating love hate relationship with any game you've played to date. you HAVE to roll with a team dont waste your time solo play. unless you no life or play on an extremely low pop server you literally will never be able to secure a base fast enough and enjoy the game without a solid team. Another thing you will have to look past is hackers. since day one hackers have always plauged this game and i think its pathetic that they still exist within every single group on OFFICIAL servers. Day one undeveloped rust sure i understand some hackers slipping through the cracks but this game has been out for years and the fact that there is still such a huge number of hackers on OFFICIAL COMPANY OWNED servers is pathetic. its only slightly frustrating when your team gathers materials for 7 hours straight then some random guy flies through your heavily fortified structure instant headshots every single person in the vicinity takes all your hard earned material then vanishes. oh did i mention this kind of stuff happened to my team three separate times this week on an official company owned server? twice by the exact same player days later? the same people will blatantly exploit and hack the game and not get banned. TL DR+ If you play with friends this is possibly one of the most fun gaming experiences you could have blatant hackers roam free on official servers on you and dont get banned... everim hooked and theres no other game that provides this rush. rust is incredible with timeless gameplay value and fun. it is one of the best games ive ever played and if facepunch could provide a solid fix to this horrible hacking issue id wholeheartedly reccomend this game. for now i recommend staying out until theyre able to at least keep the losers out of their own official servers.,Rust

2014-06-05,0,0,608,True,Not Recommended,Upon first playing this game I gravitated more towards PVE as joining PVP servers meant instantly getting face by people with guns far superior to my beloved rock. After building my fortress on PVE and a bit of a wait for people to stop DDOS'ing the game I realised there was absolutely nothing else to do so I braved PVP again. I found servers full of hackers and aim bots and people desperately complaining to admins about this that and the other. Several months later I tried again to find that nothing has changed. Also on the development front nothing has particularly been achieved for several months that I can tell othe rthan removing the zombies and adding a bed woop. The game is going nowhere and fast growing a reputation as all talk and no trousers. I do not recommend. In its place I would recommend 7 days to die the forest or survivarium.,Rust

2014-01-03,0,0,20,True,Recommended,Rust was described to me as a 3D survival minecraft (sans the digging). And it could be with some time.My small group of friends and I started a server and could'nt tear ourselves away for some time. Work your way up from the stone age (rock in hand) and eventually build yourself a fortress loaded with building materials weapons mods food and armor. So long as other players zombies and wolves don't get to you first. Greatest feeling in gaming I've had with Rust recently grouping up with your friends into a tight compound and go raiding at night to some poor sods who've only managed to collect a handful of wood and their trusty pet rock.

Looking foward to see what direction Garry and Facepunch take this. PVP can be frustrating however there are community servers with PVP disabled for all you creative builder types!

2014-01-04,0,0,814,True,Recommended,Rust is not DayZ Rust is not Minecraft. Rust is survival at an entirely different level. In Rust it takes a great deal of effort to build very little. In Rust Zombies are limited to certain areas and don t pose a great deal of threat. In Rust to progress you will need to build a base unfortunately building a base makes you a target At this point you will spend the rest of your time building other bases in order to mitigate risk. In Rust resource contention creates wars Land disputes create war. In Rust you are never really safe.This early alpha is as early as they come but it is awesome.,Rust

2016-06-02,0,0,748,True,Recommended,There are many ways to some this game up but if you combine the anarchy of Fallout with the creativity of minecraft you would find Rust. Quit reading the bad review because most of them are from people who struggled to understand the concept (and quite frankly are just butt hurt). I recommend playing it and joining a very low pop server at first till you get your feet wet. If you try to instantly join a server of 100+ people you will die rather quickly. Some people are nice some are evil. So you actually get to see the best and worst qualities of human nature. Oh and if you hate having to start over regurlarly then this isnt the game for you because at any moment you get off or are even on a group of misguided evil players can take down what you just spent a whole day on in a matter of minutes. So food for thought dont get emotionally attached to anything and keep it simple.,Rust

2018-06-19,0,0,14,False,Not Recommended,Product received for free. This game is very iffy for me and it leans more to the not so enjoyable side for me. On one hand I can see how it can be enjoyable but on the other hand it's an almost pointless and amatuer game compared to other games. It doesn't beat other survival pvp games in my opinion. The building and combat are what keep this game alive but every other aspect of the game doesn't follow up. Ark has the same problem of losing everything you have earned or worked for. Everything you have built towards can be destroyed and leave you enraged. Even in the most unlucky and unskilled ways. Games like this can rarely be mastered. So far Minecraft is the only game that is a masterpiece that has this quality. It's is so overlooked because of every other great thing about the game. Rust is okay but it's not my first option to play nor is it my 10th option.,Rust

The survival aspects are amazing and building combat etc is just golden. The devs have surely put much work into this game and update it quite frequently.

2018-05-04,0,0,36,False,Not Recommended,I've given this game a couple tries now and it's just garbage. Don't buy it. There's really nothing to do. You run around collecting a bit of junk from only a few pre determined types of containers the building sucks. 7 Days to Die despite it's progression waining is still way more fun to build and craft in. There are no enemies aside from a few scientist NPCs that just shoot at you as soon as you get close and some wild animals that kill you right away if you run into them when you start off. You starve to death in basically 10 minutes if you don't find food right away. This game is basically like Dayz but worse if that's possible.,Rust
2015-01-09,0,0,1404,False,Recommended,Spawn naked with a rock on a island with old man made structures gather craft build Rust is a really fun game devs always release new updates recently added boats and diving gear.Only problem with rust is that if you play on a vanilla server (basicaly the offical way you meant to play) the game feels like more of a job than a game you gather for a few hrs to plop down a base somewhere then gather more to stop ur base from decaying The satchels ( a explosive used to destroy items and walls) are easy to find and makes it very likley the next day you log in ur base is gone also game really makes large scale clans benifit from they new stuff with these large scale clans the server turns into a death match before u even talk you get killed so social side of the game died XD Wish devs make more effort to make solo/duo gameplay for viable,Rust
2016-04-18,0,0,184,True,Recommended,This game is good! The community can be rude at sometimes but it's overall pretty good. It's pretty easy to find a empty server so it's not really a problem. The only thing that I don't like is that when you die it's pretty unforgiving! I died right outside my house from a wolf respawned and killed the wolf but the bit me before I killed it and I bled to death! I had to wait 400 seconds to spawn again just to find out that my dead body with all my stuff was gone because my latest death overwrote it. That's the point where I rage quit but the game is so fun I keep coming back for more! It does take a lot of effort to get materials and when it comes to metal it's the worst but for some reason it's fun and relaxing. This game is way better than Ark though! 8/10,Rust

2016-04-18,0,0,2129,True,Recommended,This is a blunt review from a solo vanilla player(Who recently moved to lower population server for a change in pace)I hardly ever write reviews actually as a matter of fact I don t believe I have written a review before.That being said I feel the mad urge to because this game is something else.It is rare and unique when a game can make the leap from having an effect on your virtual character to actually having an effect on you.I know that sounds crazy but you will feel anxiety fear and you will be creeped out.Let me paint a picture for you you just spent an hour or two gathering resources to build a base and you are out at night gathering more wood and rock when you hear footsteps and your inventory is full the stuff of freaking nightmares.The virtual environment this game has created is like no other no matter what game you try unless you buy something that imitates rust but you would be a fool to spend your money like that.If you want to survive overnight in a vanilla server crouch instead of walk do not run to gunfire/do not get smart to people with guns do not approach people most servers are Kill on sight they want your meat and fat. Do not trust anyone unless you know them in person they are less likely to betray you and if they do you can get some payback.You can come across the strangest beings on the planet through this game.From awful singing to descriptive abuse of your family members to things you just never even thought another human being would think of doing/saying.Thicker skin and quick wit is a must if you want to actually survive.You will learn to hate and love this game. For all those saying there is no end game it s what you make of it.Content is always being added the debs are killing it in the best way possible think the state of alpha is more about the debs doing their jobs properly and not releasing half shit to the public and calling it a game hence weekly updates and the game has taken a form of its own.My goal is to be able to make it through a server cycle without being raided no shame in admitting I haven t clocked the game yet.The grind is large but the feeling of achievement after finishing your project/mission or whatever you are doing is much larger.There are problems that need to be addressed with cheating being one of the MAJOR problems.No salt here but your 500m headshot that you managed to pull off while I was only able to see your head move up and down as a pixel doesn t actually seem plausible at all.Nope I actually truly simply can tell you You had an aimbot ohh and now you raided my entire base with your 6 boyfriends. Mint.Insert.randymarsh&amp pc.jpegOther main issue is optimising which I know I agreed to because it is Early Access but hardware requirements for the game are quite high if you want to run it at good FPS which you do FPS drops cost resources. Average FPS ATM are around 30 40 on a GTX780ti plenty of ram ssds and cpu. Crashes due to bugs majorly annoying especially if you play in a populated server which means queuing and since you can t always be on rust you become loot. Unsure if debs were trolling but unable to change what your character looks like seems like it shouldn t bother me too much but the fact the fact I am now a female with no hair makes me feel a bit sad . I can t frolic around the rust paddocks with this mean ginger mane.TL DRPlay it smart get to know your guns do some research if you must.Once you dive into this game you will fully comprehend what I meant if you don t like losing be prepared to rage quit and put your hardware away fast enough so you don t smash it.Completely and absolutely a must have.Shoot the squeakers.PS if you too are getting destroyed by clans in the server try low population servers you won t find too many clans and you can do the raiding for a change.,Rust

2016-04-19,0,0,38,True,Recommended,Use your head and this is a great game. A reflection of humanity where most cannot be trusted and you have to be very wary of any form of interaction. It's the insecurity and backstabbing that make it so tense to play. Find a secluded spot and avoid people like the plague in the early game. Bears and wolves will stalk your camp and give you enough to think about. Then once you have your weapons and armour you can sort the good players from the bad and figure out who to team up with. Very atmospheric very intense and there are far worse games out there for 14.99,Rust

2014-06-15,0,0,160,True,Recommended,Rust is a great game well worth the price even if in alpha. I consider it a lot like minecraft but actually a good game. Basically the objective of the game is to gather resources like wood food fuel and survive by making a shelter and weapons. You may even be able to build an empire and rule the land if surviving long enough and getting some friends. As for the graphics the graphics are beautiful with a cinematic touch to them. The gameplay is great but has some issues that need ironing out. For example some items and structures require way too many materials in order to create them. A wood wall for example takes 30 wood in which can take a great deal of time to get just for a small wall when done alone. Also this issue may require a lot of thought to fix but you will end up dying a lot and i mean a lot. Most of the time by other players. Its almost impossible to survive over 20 mins without getting murdered by another player. If its not the other players its the wolves. Also other players can easily steal your items in which is a bit (VERY) annoying. My main solution for this is to have a single player option in which you can just mess around alone instead of fighting over materials with other players and getting murdered every five minuites. Besides that the game is very entertaining challenging and can be a great time alone or with friends. I recommend you purchase this game ASAP while in early access so you get the game for a good deal.Have a great day and buy Rust! Martin Septim,Rust

The issue this small map creates is there is no where to hide. They should also make the ability to raid a little harder thanks for fixing the bug with the 1 c4 takes out an entire wall if placed properly.... now lets give the new guys a chance with making the doors take more than 2 3 C4 to blow up. I honestly always play on servers that dont have anyone on them which ends up sucking because those servers go away due to ""lack of players"".

It's not only the games themselves but part of the fact that you build up so much stuff and you're content with it...but then you're crushed and you have to start all over again...But for some reason...I absolutely LOVE rust.I don't know what it is about it but it's just so... Fun!Could it be the atmosphere?Could it be the simplicity yet daringness of trying to survive?Could it be the naked men running around everywhere with rocks trying to beat eachother to death?Probably the latter.GET RUST NOW OR THE ARMY OF THE NAKED ROCK MEN WILL FIND AND DESTROY YOU!,Rust

Suddenly the door breaks and you hear two shots ring out and suddenly you are dead. you wake up naked and alone with a rock in your hand and the base is gonespeed forward a couple of days you now have a base of your own even a few guns and you are now the one punishing those god damn noobs that know they deserve it and take their stuff. you rule your own little kingdom and you are happy there knowing full well that anyone that set their foot in your lands will pay the price.then you hear a click on your front door and a sudden quick beeping a tear runs down your cheek as you realise its c4 and you are getting raided. you arm yourself with all your guns as the first explosion goes off. you wake up naked on a beach,Rust

2014-12-13,0,0,105,True,Recommended,I was lucky and bought this game when it was discounted and i am glad i did.This game is really fun to play with friends as you can do pretty much anything you want. The main problem with this game is that the people are very trigger happy so you need to be careful if you are alone but i suppose if you are in a group of less than 4 you need to be just as careful as you are easier to spot. Anyway I've been told that the shooting in this is similar to CS GO but since I am poor i would not know if that is true.Recently they released a new version of Rust and renamed the old one as the Legacy edition or whatever. The new version is nice and has better graphics but the mechanics need work as you can't enter a room that has 2 doors open inside of it already (if you don't understand it's because i don t know how to explain the situation properly). And another problem is that there aren't many animals that are easy to kill e.g. wolves and bears are just as common as chickens which makes it extremely hard to survive as the wolves and bears now run faster than you and don't stop chasing you they even swim now. The new map is pretty much split into 3 sections the top section is made out of snowy hills and stuff the middle section is the greener part where you find animals and trees and the bottom section is the desert which i'm pretty sure has nothing in.But all in all it's not that bad I can't wait until they put new stuff in the new version.,Rust

2018-06-19,0,0,2465,False,Recommended,Rust is by far one of the best games I have ever played. While it's toxicity can bring anyone's opinion down on the game I have nearly 700hours on the game and have enjoyed all of it. There is plenty of things that you can do such as meet up with your friends and take down people on the server grab some new scuba gear drive out to the ocean and see what you can find or if you like to roleplay you can also do that. These arent even close to the number of other options you have while playing Rust. In my personal opinion based of monthly updates great customer assistance and a all around good game I would highly reccomend Rust as a game worth buying.,Rust
2018-01-04,0,0,2325,False,Not Recommended,"After 2 000 i reached the limit rust can provide. It doesn't matter how well you play. If its not admin abuse banning you because you said something or did something. You will play offical servers and wish you had admins because of hackers killing you instantly.This is not a 10 min match of Call of Duty. Each wipe cycle is sometimes 100s of hours you devote to your base your clan your server. You can have clan members destroy everything in minutes. You can raid people so perfectly only to have a hacker killed all 4 of you and take in seconds away what you worked hours for.I left PUBG for this game. The worst thing to happen to games is cheaters. I can't just accept losing my loot because of cheaters that get banned weeks after they cheat. The community servers are better because admins will ban anyone even close to cheating. But they also have complete power of deleting the base you spent 100 hours last week working on.I've caught admins breaking their own rules. https //www.youtube.com/watch?v ilTrsimueNQ&amp t 203sHere is a hacker who poked a corner and shot me in 0.2 seconds https //www.youtube.com/watch?v _UsEj5BXQ7U The more you play the more you can't leave. Soon you will go to bed thinking if you will have a base the next time you get on you will create shift cycles with your friends to see who will watch the base. You will start to call buildings on other games ""base"". Its a game that either is perfect or isn't worth it.Don't play it. Its pretty much controlled by the people and the people on this game say some of the worst things you will every read on the internet. ITS TERRIBLE. You either play with 10 people or you don't play at all. Its not for solo players. You need to be in a group. The game as in early access for 5 YEARS! It came out a year before GTA 5 came out.

The main problem i have at the moment is their system which to make the game better for low level players making good items harder and more requiring. in my opinion its making big clans better with their manpower and making them all powerfull with their guns and c4 that others struggle for days to research and ultimatly give up on,Rust
2016-05-05,0,0,1075,False,Not Recommended,this game I'm tired of trying to force myself to like it. You have a dice roll's chance of having a good time but you will 100% need to spend absolutely stupid amounts of hours to start having fun. The point of the game is to raid people for their hard earned stuff which is fun when it happens but you probably aren't a part of the largest group or any large group so you're already behind and have no way to defend no amount of smart tactics or skill will prevent you from losing everything and having to restart. The building system is basic the game content is bland and the playerbase is toxic. The devs aren't geniuses and there aren't many of them so what development does happen is slow and shallow. Any game you play with friends will probably be a good time save yourself the ing trouble and find something worth your time this is not worth your time.,Rust

Although the game is currently in Alpha stage it plays really well though there are obviously flaws in it's current state (to be expected for an Alpha) the game plays smoothly and looks good too. Plenty of servers to chose from with PVP PVE and raiding or not. and a friendly community (at least in the server I play on) This game can only get better so I would recommend buying it while it is still in it's Alpha stage ( 19.99) for what is bound to be a nice saving!,Rust

If you are just getting started and you are having trouble it is because you need to focus on the basics Crafting a sleeping bag to respawn and building your first home should be your main first objective.,Rust
2015-08-14,0,0,254,False,Not Recommended,I decided to play with 3 friends about 2 or 3 months ago the server wipe was about to happen and we decided it would be a good time to wait for the wipe so we can get on a server and set up a base early because setting up a base weeks after a wipe is cancer we met up with a group of 4 or 5 Americans who were in the same position as us we all decided to team up made a base it lasted about 2 days we had like 8 people and we couldn't last 2 days don't even bother doing a solo base when you spawn in after a wipe there are tons of people on the beach waiting for you to spawn so that they can kill you for resources there's no way to make progress solo pretty much unless you have 1000 hours and you're a pvp god the devs aren't going to fix the problem this is what clans have done to the game I remember 2 years ago I played the game with a group of dutch people and we made a ton of progress there were clans but they were way less cancerous than they are now the game just isn't fun and I can't recommend it it's a cesspool of vermin.,Rust

And now they are raging saying on the home page of their game ""Tell us we're bad at our jobs on Steam."" they really are bad at their jobs right now and they are definatly paying for it with an average of 5 000 people on rust when the old average used to be 50 000+.

2014-02-04,0,0,14,True,Not Recommended,Don't get me wrong this game has alot of potential but right now in alpha this is all that happens to me the first in game day I spend running around naked with a rock trying to find wood piles or boulders to extract some basic resources from. By day 2 I have a little shelter built with a fire to keep me warm a caveman like hatchet in hand clothes on my back and sleeping bag made to set my resawn point just incase i die in the wilderness so I won't have to go back to running around naked with a rock again lol.By day 3 it's just the same thing over and over find animals find wood piles find boulders then run back to the shelter to store said resources so eventually I can make a decent weapon to keep me safe from the crazy ers running around shooting every player on sight noob or not.Now it's usually toward the end of day 3 or 4 that I go running back to camp to store some resources when some with a shotgun comes out of nowhere blows my head off in one hit tears down the door to my shelter and then starts destroying everything i spent the last few hours working on. So now I have to completely start over and go through the same t I have already went through a dozen times already. I would suggest you save the $20 for when the game gets more developed and better balanced because right now all that happens is you run around for a couple hours before some kills you and destroys your hard work all for sport! It just gets old and frustrating fast.,Rust

2016-06-05,0,0,1584,True,Recommended,I bought this game before its current build and I must say that it has changed for the better. The mechanics of the game are very well thought through and work pretty well. There is a lot to do even if most of it needs a lot of grinding for materials. Its a blast to play with friends but on your own this game is insanly challenging. The community of players is absolutly terrible for the most part. Everyone will be hostile and you need any sort of group to survive on a server with over 30 players. I would still recommend this game. You can still find servers with people who are less hostile you just really need to dig. I would still recommend this game because once you have a group of friends to play with this game becomes so much better its unbelievable. A must buy when its on sale but for the full price watch some gameplay to reach a decision and read more than just one review.,Rust

2016-06-05,0,0,171,True,Recommended,Product received for free. It's a very fun game. It's basically another one of those survival games everyone loves similar to Unturned except way better in my opinion. The game is still early access so expect lots of bugs. The game requires a pretty beefy computer to run at an acceptable FPS (30) so you may have to play at the worst settings. The survival mechanics are much better crafting and materials are more diverse tools weapons and other stuff like that feel almost real and of course who could forget the interactions with other players. I have yet to mug someone using a waterpipe shotgun. Note There is no singleplayer mode at this time. I'm glad my friend bought it for me and can't thank him enough!

2014-02-05,0,0,160,True,Recommended,The game is very enjoyable exciting and stressful. I understand why they added pants to all new players but it kind of takes away from the whole helpless feeling knowing your rocking a pair of green slacks. There are many friendly players most scattering like roaches when a light is flipped on at first sight of another player and some that want to help those just learning the ropes. One thing I can't seem to catch a grasp of is why ANYONE would feel threatened by a man hacking away at a tree or rock and feel they need to KOS. Its fun if you don't mind spending your day being ultra paranoid and wondering when you'll hear bullets flying your way or hear someone hacking at your shack door while creepy night music featuring drums is serenading the soon to be bullying event and repeat.,Rust

2014-02-05,0,0,235,True,Recommended,Rust utilizes strategy building resource gathering and warfare to create a very interesting and addictive gaming experience. Each server has it's own community and vibe allowing different types of players to find the right place to invest their time. The learning curve isn't extremely steep but challenging enough to keep bringing you back for more. Any game that relies on the players to create the content gets a thumbs up from me.

Game has large community and always easy to find populous servers to play. Game provides flexibility to player you can try to build your base near any resources you want considering the risk level and spend time to upgrade it to keep secure of your loot or you can leap into action and fight unceasingly kill other players steal their loot or even break into their base with explosives etc. The only thing that never changes is the tension between the being a hunt or hunter.

2018-09-10,0,0,129,False,Not Recommended,Product received for free. If you intend on playing this game alone Don't. There was a time when this was a game. Now it is a full time job. Rust is single handidly responsible for the most toxic little elementary school racist kiddie player base in gaming history. More so than CoD back in the 360 days. More than half of my hours came from the days when Rust was an enjoyable game. Today it is completely unplayable. The player base declines on a daily basis. Grinding increases with each update. All in all this is not an enjoyable experience for anyone playing alone. And even if you start out in a clan one by one they will leave Rust for good and there will be no more clan.,Rust
2018-08-18,0,0,191,False,Recommended,Firstly rust is probably the best and most frustrating game on the market. What i love about the game is the ability to keep expanding keep grinding there is no endgame and monthly updates and wipes keep the game fresh. The building is great The combat is great The resource management is great. Though people think the community is toxic I personally think that it is great i meet many nice people as i roam the radiated wasteland Mostly i am killed in fun pvp fights but it is the way of the game and i find that combat is better as you could kill a resouce farmer or a guy with many weapons. I find it best to play with friends as in my experience we can get a double 4x4 honeycomb with exterior walls up in 12 hours. Overall the best playstile is to be with friends as it splits up the required work time. Raiding and being raided is the way of life. When you seek your heart and sould into the game you feel happy one minute but when u log on the next day you wake up on a beach wich means u have been raided wich is mostly frustrating. Overall i reccomend this game to people who love hardcore grindy games The grind always pays off when u have a huge crate full of semi autos and Aks!,Rust

On your own you don't stand a chance against most clans.It's either you play this game 8 hours a day and have fun or you play this game 2 hours a day and you get on every time you play.

2016-07-06,0,0,2827,False,Recommended,The game is really good and it has NO problems! The community is great and you will meet alot of mature adults that can be your friend. I have met so many grown men that add me and like to talk to me. They always want to see my picture and they send theirs its really fun and great way to interact with older people because im 12 and don't meet many adults that like kids. Good community and if you want more steam friend play this game D,Rust
2014-02-05,0,0,45,True,Recommended,This game is barely finished and has entertained 15 hours from me in just 3 days. Dear God it's so worth it. It's one of those games that gives a really player driven experience and forces you to interact with others or risk losing everything.There are problems with the game right now and to sum those up I would say that right now it's a little too difficult to get established as a newbie on a 50 player server. You can get comfortable with a reasonable amount of resources and be able to defend yourself while online but as soon as you go offline your character is left as a sleeper in the game world. At that point people can simply destroy your poorly defended hut with one or two C4 bundles and take everything with ease. The result is that you have to spend 1 or 2 consecutive successful hours of survival to be able to continue beyond cloth armor pipe shotguns and a 1x1 single floor wooden shack. It's hard it's a little unforgiving and I think the game would be better if new spawns on a server had more ability to defend themselves.,Rust

2014-02-05,0,0,1038,True,Recommended,Join a public server to get the feel of the chaos in the game.Then find an empty private server to get a feel of the solo experience.Then find server with a nice community and good admins and settle in.You WILL lose all your stuff but you will learn how to protect it.You WILL get griefed by a holes but the community will gather up against them.You will probably lose all your stuff again to hackers but a good admin might help you recover.All in all the enjoyability of this game (in its current alpha state) comes down to finding the right server for you. And don't stop looking it's out there somewhere.Once you find it the game is worth every penny.,Rust

I had fun with my friend surviving the endless bugs. But all in all this game is great has allot of cool features. PVP has calmed down a bit and it's not impossible to survive sure admins get a little trigger finger happy but that's to be expected from a game like this where admins can do as they wish. So find a good server settle down and enjoy.,Rust

You will not be able to go anywhere even your own home without being scared that your life will be ended in an instant by someone you cant even see. No matter what gear you have there will be someone stronger and tougher than you. Between the NPCs hunger thirst the cold and fellow people you are garunteed to eventually die and lose everything. All of your items are at constant risk and at some point you will be raided and lose everything. You will make friends that will shoot you in the back unless you shoot them in the back first.

2014-02-20,0,0,342,True,Not Recommended,Great survival game the building hunting and pvp is all very fun. Graphics are very good and the scenery looks great. It lacks a real NPC threat on the map save for the random attack helicopter that patrolls by and lights your world up. The biggest downside to this game is the amount of cheaters present. Just go and look at their ban counter on twitter they ban a ton of cheaters all of the time but never have really cleared them from the game. You spend a lot of time farming and gathering and having it all torn down by someone flying or being picked off from out of visual range by an aimbot just isn't fun and until they really put in effort to fix this I wouldn't buy this game.,Rust

2014-01-07,0,0,0,True,Not Recommended,"This game really only boasts the ability to build your own building and gather resources but that's about it. Gameplay is unplayably choppy with mele it makes it near impossible to do anything other than just gather resources and hope you find some food before dying of starvation. Save your money and don't get duped into another early access game that probably wont develop any further than it is now. Why? Because you are just giving them as much money as a full game with a barely any features that justify paying for the game in the first place. All they say is ""so please trust us."" How long will it take for them to make it better? Are you going to blindly trust them or refuse to give them money until they come out with something worth the money?",Rust

2014-01-07,0,0,20,True,Not Recommended,So I've gotten to the point in DayZ SA that I can't relax at all. I've reached end game and am paranoid as hell. So I picked up this game to not give a crap about and to just have fun. The textures arn't all that great the animations are ok and direction is little to none. I joined a 10 population server and tried to find someone to help me out. Of course I knew already that it was probably going to end up like in day Z. I found a camp of people and walked into the middle of it. I got on the mic and asked if anyone was there. 2 people walked out of their make shift homes made out of wooden boards while holding shotguns. I knew already that I wasn't going to live very long because that's how survival games are. I asked them if they could help me out and then they shot me in the face... After I respawned I ran around aimlessly just trying to explore the world. It's not that impressive. there is the random zombie here and there and there is also a radiation element. It's very early Alpha and I'm sure this game will eventually get better but for just a few dollars more DayZ is much better than this game. Plus DayZ has been around a while and has been tried and tested. Honestly I would stay away from this game for now. Spend your money on something else.,Rust

Please get some balls and build a game that you want not just listen to the few out there complaining. Yes i say few because the ones enjoying it are PLAYING it and not taking the time to leave comments. Well now your going to get the other side of ones who were enjoying it complain. I'm so sick to death of these alpha game's you get people hooked just to bash them down by changing the main reasons they buy the damn thing's.

2017-06-20,0,0,400,True,Recommended,"tl dr good game that is very pvp oriented having a somewhat good community good developers that listen and update frequently.Rust is a very pvp oriented game little or no pve factor in the game in my eyes. The helicopter is one pve factor but can be easily avoided by just not equiping a gun or having lots of clothing on. players are your main threat in the game. If youre someone who loves a pvp game who loves the thrill of maybe dying and loosing everything rust is definitely a game for you. The replayablity factor of rust is pretty good but unique experiences can get pretty dull. You might come across that interesting guy who is friendly or gives you good gear but the majority of players kill on sight even killing nakeds sometimes who pose no threat. In my eyes facepunch should really add something that can effect the player greatly that cannot be avoided. Or a bigger reason to ""team up"" and not senselessly murder everyone.",Rust

2018-06-29,0,0,2498,False,Recommended,Rust is an incredible game that gets my adrenaline going almost every time I play it. The raw ideas of starting from scratch and building up what you want with the risk of losing everything from other players is amazing as well as making plays on others as well. Recent updates however have made it nearly impossible to succede as a solo player so if you have friends this game has amazing potential but otherwise its an extreme and sometimes very annoying grind by yourself. Overall rating 9/10 good adrenaline packed pvp and the survival feeling was captured almost perfectly not to mention they are still adding plenty of content every month from their updates and tweaking the way the game works from time to time. My only true dislikes of this game is the frame drops (depending on the servers you are on) and the fact that solo players are practically extinct.,Rust

Trying to find this fabled town I built myself a temporary shelter on the coastline near an easily recognizable landmark. Night fell and as I was cooking chicken meat (or pig? all of the animals drop chicken meat for some reason alpha. that's why ) I heard a banging on my door. I hadn't tested out my newly crafted bow with 32 arrows (painstakingly made after two hours) but I nocked an arrow and hesitantly opened the door. It was a raider. My first shot landed in his shoulder as he jumped over my storage crate to gore me with a stone hatchet. My second and third shots missed and by that time I was bleeding heavily. I looked up at him and asked ""Why?"" ""This is my land. You didn't pay taxes"" he said. ""Why didn't you ask me first?"" I pleaded.

Must admit playing this game alone isn't all that great but when you get a group of friends togheter and head out to build shelter and find/craft the greatest items this game realy shines.This game doesn't realy help you all that much. In the beginning you just get dropped in the map with only a rock bandages and a torch to help you out. So the learning curb can be quite steap. Having the map around does help alot. you can find it on Rustmap.net,Rust

It has it's ups and downs but for the most part it's very fun to play. If you like faction games than this is a perfect game for you and your friends. WARNING There are still many bugs and glitches in the game! This is because this game is only in alpha so that means the creators still have much more they want to add and introduce to this game. Also if someone has a mic and if you get close to them in game then you will be able to hear them talk! WARNING This game does have nudity!

2014-08-31,0,0,112,True,Recommended,Ar first this game can be overwhelming most gamers seek to survive and keep moving foward but don't think twice about what Rust is all about. Rust is about scavaging hard for what you need protecting yourself building a roof over your head and making life as easy as Rust will allow you to. The goal making the gamers end feeling be satisfaction they want you to feel imersered into the game but at the same time they want you to be relaxed and enjoy yourself. You're probably wondering how can a game where naked people beat you with rocks be relaxing??? Well it boils down to this all the effort you put into surving at the end of the day you get what you put in. A hard days work leaves you around a crackling fire listening to the wind blowing against the trees and shuffling leaves and listening to a crickets melody. This is what Rust is about Die Retry and be Satisfied is what will make you have the best experices you could ever imagine that no other game can give you. Highly recommend Rust to anyone who is willing to explore new oppurtunities.,Rust

2017-11-01,0,0,2693,False,Recommended,Good game while it lasted for me but it's hella toxic if you are a sensitive Overall if you're not a you can have a great time in this game because I had a great time.I have logged a total of 3.2k hours on the time of this review on two accounts and it has been really fun to play and especially pvp and talk people. During my time playing I pretty much only played this game everyday for an autistic amount of time. Also if you are buying the game for the first time don't expect to be raiding and on kids and pulling off 1v4's and cause it just won't happen. Sadly at this time the game has started to die out for me and has become slightly boring but that's only because i've moved onto other games (Fortnite etc.). Don't let the end of this review change your mind about buying this game because once you get the hang of pvp and find a friend/group you can go pvping and raiding or you can just build/roleplay if that is what you're into.,Rust

2016-03-28,0,0,2069,True,Recommended,What's great about this game is that it allows me to be creative with building and pvp survival strategy. Resource gathering can get to be a bit of a grind. However if resources were more abundant fighting may not be as adrenaline inducing. My house may last a day it may last a week who knows. It depends what server I m on where I built my house how I built my house and how I ve treated other players around my house. It's up to you to determine what type of player you become. There are endless servers and it takes time to find one that works for you. If you re new and you plan on starting off solo try starting off on a small server with 0 5 population and learn the basics of the game. When you get bored with that join a larger server to get used to the face to face combat and other player interactions. Killed too many times and you re frustrated? Try teaming up with someone on a mid sized vanilla server. Your friend betrayed you and stole your s***? Join a battlefield type server for some instant shootouts. Tired of that? Join the Battle Royale server for some hunger games style action. The game is what you make of it.,Rust

2016-03-29,0,0,62,True,Not Recommended,The concept of this game is great and fun until you're killed by a 11 year old or a hacker. You have two choices either play with a ton of people then get killed once every hour and loose everything or play with low number of people and see no one and nothing to do. Soloing the game is pointless you cannot survive alone you will be raided and killed everytime. In closing the concept of the game itself is cool but actual playability in a setting with 100 other people it's not realistic for soloing or having a good time actually advancing when all you do is die and lose everything. Just comes down to who has the best weapons and can kill off everyone putting them at a disadvantage while having no chance until a server wipe. It's more of an fps than survival.,Rust

Facepunch does a great job adding new content and keeping the game fun.The community for Rust is VERY TOXIC but the game is kind of ment to be toxic just keep this in mind if you don't like to be raided or lude behaviour.

2014-09-07,0,0,760,True,Recommended,Rust is a fun game due to its Concept so with that being said I cannot wait until its final release! The game causes all kinds of alliances and rebellions against players yet this one lacks in the Survival Department. The reason I say that is because Rust has me focusing more on FPS style fighting rather than keeping my belly full and staying Hydrated I do miss the zombies too they were good target practice. Overall Rust is a fun game and I've spent countless hours with friends Gathering Looting and Raiding! this is a must have for sure! Survival entheusiast or not!,Rust

Would like to see vehicles added already walking around the big maps is very slow and I feel like vehicles would add a different dimension to the game faster paced and alot more action. I understand the game is based off survival but sitting in your base not seeing anyone for hours even on a populated server can become boring very quickly. Not fond of the jumping system in the game the animation looks very weird I'm not quite sure how to explain it almost choppy like. The shooting is not bad could be improved a little bit sometimes feels clunky. Other than that the game is fun and just needs the addition of Vehicles to make it a favorite for me...,Rust

2018-03-22,0,0,56,False,Not Recommended,I bought this game back in 2014 when the game was still in early access. I've watched the game evolve from a sandbox survival with major pvp elements into a clan dominated game. The game is nearly unplayable without being in a small to large group. The game has gone from the original raids and zombie survival into just plain raiding. Max geared players going around killing fresh spawns really prevent my friends and I from getting back into the game.If you have a group of friends and don't mind getting crushed by bigger groups go ahead and give it a shot. It's not that bad of a game.,Rust

2017-11-25,0,0,45,True,Recommended,I've never got around to reviewing this game but i feel i need to.It really is fantastic. Definitely has some of the most caring developers of anything ive played. They truly listen to the community and experiment wisely without breaking the foundation of what Rust is at heart. Solid Updates WEEKLY. Check out their reddit if you're curious.Its a hard core pvp survival not for the faint of heart. You will get murked. Rust is merciless. But if you persevere through the t it will be totally worth the challenge.They say you can't play solo but I do quite often successfully. You just need to play on a solo or solo/duo/trio community server. Speaking of the community as a whole IS quite toxic but that doesnt mean everyone is. I've met plenty of good people in game. The game's depth comes with the experiences you encounter with other players as well as the building aspect. Building is definitely my favorite part and theyre starting to add more cosmetic items like carpets and chairs ect.Farm&gt Build&gt Loot&gt Upgrade&gt Roam. Not really in that order specifically but this is what you do in Rust. Sounds basic but it always tend to keep people interested week after week. You dont necessarilyTBC but is that all needed to understand this is real. good game. buy buy,Rust

2014-03-13,0,0,282,False,Recommended,I wish steam had a 0/10 system. This is a good game but in its currennt form is essentially one mass player vs. player griefing spree with long stetches of rez grinding for the interim. Either you are the griefed or the griefer. There is no exception and if you attempt to be kindly expect constant griefing. Wait for the official release where maybe people don't gun down fresh spawns with an M4 for target practice.If you disagree watch the Rust youtube series by BruceWillakers (note there are expletives so if you are a 7 year old reading this please don't expand your vocabulary in fact stop playing this game before you expand your vocabulary.) He plays as a greifer and a sadistic one at that. I will recommend this game when a kinder sort of community takes over.EDIT 2015 The game is now much more playable and the griefers are somwhat less evil (I actually had a raider leave my sleeper alive AND leave a few items for me to get started up again.) So though it is still a grief spree it is somewhat less violent in New Rust. Note Play on servers with 5 or more times rez for a more enjoyable less lumberjack simulator experience.UPDATE 2018 The community is back to a bunch of KOS grinders with no desire to interact with others but it's not as much of an issue as it is really easy to get set up nowadays. Even if you never get to endgame you can have a mess about pretty easily. Youl probably die half a dozen times but it'll be okay.,Rust

2018-06-01,0,0,227,False,Not Recommended,THIS GAME IS NOT FOR CASUAL PLAYERS Used to love spending countless hours on this game enjoyed it with a passion. But now the game has taken a turn down a different path. Its honestly too hard to compete now. The massive clans flood the servers and honestly people have gotten too good at the game. Too keep up with the server you have to 4+ hours grinding and thats if you don't get killed collecting resources. If your planning on playing on a public server with less than 8 people your screwed. Clans with 25 people can have 4 people online at almost all hours collecting resources. You can't compete with that. They outnumber and overwhelm anyone taking them on in a fight and it become almost impossible to compete with them as an average player. Now let me make this clear THIS GAME IS NOT FOR CASUAL PLAYERS. You have to devote hours to this game. If your very competitive and willing to spend countless hours gathering resources only to be killed by 5 players with AK's with you trying to defend yourself with a bow then this game is for you.

It's been about 2 years since the ""new rust"" update and i stll cannot handle it. The maps are randomly generated the updates still do about nothing and it's been ing years. They had something fantastic going and completely ruined it. As Legacy Rust is ruined with hackers that make it unplayable. I don't see how anyone can enjoy this rust. It went from being something realistic to something fake and cartoony. It looks as if it were made for children. In this rust the animals don't even work not even THE ING ANIMALS.

2016-04-07,0,0,414,True,Recommended,Rust brings a new flavor to the table with an innovative formula blending survival aspects crafting and shooting mechanics all in the same package. In regards to performance my mediocre GTX 560ti along with my i5 2600K run fine on the 'simple' settings of Rust. In regards to what makes this game special I would have to say the communities and social interactions between others (hostile friendly or neutral) adds a new layer to strategy. Communication is key as well as a mutually beneficial team.,Rust

2017-10-12,0,0,1612,True,Recommended,Close to 1 500 hours and no where near stopping. The game gets regular updates and content is being added all the time you can tell the Devs really care about the development of this game. The learning curve when you first start is high but give this game a good shot and you'll find your new addiction. My advice make some friends. Also understand that the game is still in Early Access and sometimes things aren't completely balanced but they Devs listen to feedback and are always working on improving/balancing whatever systems are currently in game.,Rust

2017-10-12,0,0,1372,True,Recommended,Good game with an awful community.,Rust
2017-10-12,0,0,451,True,Recommended,"A lot of reviews here complain about the community. A lot of reviews complain about the ""current state"" of the game. The fact of the matter is even if its been this way for a while the game is in Early Access. There are almost always weekly patches that add new content revert unwanted content and sometimes drastically alter the core gameplay. This is both the best and worst part about Rust. Being excited to try something new every couple weeks keeps players from getting too bored and even when they do they'll generally revisit. Salty players tend to leave bad reviews because they are dissatisfied with the game ""today"" and don't give it a fair enough assessment considering all of its high points. This game is absolutely not for everyone and if you don't enjoy a challenge or can't accept loss and defeat then move on. This is a survival game and surviving isn't handed to you on a platter at all.The game is rough around the edges but slowly coming into its own. It has been the most fun game I've ever played the most awful game I've ever played and the most frightening game I've ever played. Nothing is as heart pounding as spending a week gathering loot and fortifying your base to have some guys all geared up knocking on your front door with rocket launchers in hand. Making a run to a monument finding a rifle for the first time and trying to survive the run home. Filling your inventory with wood to build a giant base just to get wrecked by a homicidal helicopter and losing it all. The feeling of persisting through all of the terrible things that can happen to you in Rust shooting down and raiding your enemies and coming out on top is one of the most gratifying feelings a video game can give to you... especially since this is online and hundreds of others are playing alongside or against you. You can revel in your accomplishments and know that if you run outside get into a firefight with a group of dudes and die you can re spawn back at home and brush it off with plenty more gear to keep trucking. Not to mention the insatiable gratification that comes from revenge after destroying what your enemies worked for... just like what they did to you days ago.You will like this game. Not immediately maybe not even after a week... but its worth the learning curve.",Rust
2017-10-12,0,0,795,True,Recommended,Good game good concept good changes active developers. ABSOLUTE POOP community that derails the game development any way they can. (for example leaving negative reviews for no reason and trying to make the game a 48hs csgo/pubg game). If you can get past the children go ahead and buy it. If not i recomend you to stay away.,Rust
2017-10-12,0,0,178,True,Recommended,yes,Rust
2017-10-12,0,0,620,True,Recommended,The developers get the jobs they want done and are transparent about what they are planning and implementing in a well produced and thought out blog post. They constantly interact with their fan base whilst at the same time try out new formulas. The team don't shine and even pretty much re made the game because they were honest with themselves and it didn't meet their own standards.,Rust

2016-04-03,0,0,4,True,Recommended,Occasional FPS Drops and no Singleplayer option. However you can join an empty server so that can be worked around.,Rust
2016-04-03,0,0,41,True,Not Recommended,"I got this game because I've seen it around for a while now and wanted something I could play with my friends that has better graphics than something like minecraft. I watched some youtube videos on it that showed the ""leveling up"" process how basic gear leads to better and better stuff etc.But there was no mention of how inaccessible mid to late game is to newcomers. I spent 13 hours on this game and I have absolutely nothing to show for it. As soon as you get away from the starting area and move inland you're immediately shot by someone with full body armor and assault rifles (while I'm naked and have maybe crafted basic tools at this point)There's simply no fun in this game. You run around crouch and hide in bushes while trying to gather supplies completely paranoid that you might get killed by fully geared players who have nothing better to do.I assume this is a major reason for the biweekly server wipes since without this the players who are already fully advanced will simply shut down anyone who didnt start playing this game early on.Aside from the massive amount of bugs (e.g. animals run in small circles until hunted then escape clipping through stones and buildings this game has been out for almost 3 years?) there's no worse feeling than finally starting to build your fort and being killed and looted before you have your 4 walls up. I think the problem is not just a toxic community but also that the goal of Rust changes from a potentially great Minecrafty survival/crafting game to a mediocre onesided FPS.I've never written a review before but with these 13 hours of utter frustration I can't recommend this game in its current state and will not be playing it anymore.",Rust

2014-01-28,0,0,101,True,Not Recommended,This game is way too rampant with cheaters and bandits.The fact that the game encourages and is pushing forwards to PVP leads the game to be more of an FPS then a survival aspect.Which would be great and all if the game wasent filled to the brim with a mentality that is common place in most survival games shoot everybody.The game is alright when you have a decent setup running but you're SOL getting there. The only reason you'll be enjoying it when you're there is because you're not getting shot and having to endure the same death screams for sixteen seconds at a time while some korean dude is yelling foriegn slurrs at you.The 'shoot everbody' mentality drains players of any sense of creativity and friendliness.

I've now played more than 60 hours built many houses and bases I had so much fun with some friends loot and base raiding and here is my opinion Its worth buying but its still 50% completed in my opinion so consider that when you are playing.Hackers are the most annoying problem of the game right now and ruining this beautiful game. Other that that the game itself is very fun to play especially with friends.I also have some recomendations A purpose more than just surviving (game is a little dull right now and there is not much thing to do) An in game map ! (I learned the map by walkin around and from the wiki but not everyone is good at finding destination) *Not putting a map actually a good thing in a survival game because navigation skills can save your life in real life. Noob protection (30 mins after first entered the server or sth. like that but only for the first time) Better defence tools (more than some doors maybe a high quality metal door or traps etc.) More animals (Horse or donkey for transport Cow and bulls for meat) New enemies (mutants npc bandits in the wild or in the loot areas etc.) Caves or A big ruined city (for ultimate loot area or for rare materials) Time ! (its not very important but its good to have an in game watch) High quality metal safe (an absolute container for player to save at least some important tools from raiding like 9 slots) More guns (some people are against snipers but i think it will be very fun to have at least a bolt action rifle with a scope) Random events such as airdrops. Maybe a smuggler npc appears in random areas at random times selling rare blackmarket items for some bottle of waters. (if snipers added they can be obtained only by smugglers by chance nd that may prevent the sniper terror in the servers) Infection and cure (mutants or zombies infect players and they gain some abilities like less damaga from radiation but fast drop in the food level and some antidotes for it found in the loot areas) Better server list (server names are not displaying fully)I hope this helped both the developers and the future players who is thinking about buying the game.EDIT FROM 2018...I can say that most of the stuff I wrote here added to the game and I'm kind of proud what I wrote here 4 years ago! This game has changed too much in a good way and getting even better each day...Keep up the good work guys!,Rust

Seems as though they don't know where they want to go with it. they had a good thing going but couldn't make it work to accomodate their next progression so they scrapped it and started fresh (steam video trailer is the old alpha rust). I was real excited in the begining but slowly became disappointed. I would wait a few months and see how it developes wait and see how the new content moves along. It has potential just hope they don't run around in circles with it. They have a dev blog which they do update regularly for you to follow playrust.com.,Rust

2014-11-08,0,0,27,True,Not Recommended,There is a too long didn't read version at the bottom. Some of what I say will be wrong due to modded servers. Those servers will help if you don't like the real challenge this game is or if you just want to play casually. I've never posted a review before so here it goes... Essentially this game is really intriguing a huge sandbox with a pretty decent pvp(combat) system and has a good feel when it comes to building structures once you get the hang of it. However without doing research they (hid) the fact that there are mandatory server wipes. Meaning everything you worked for and did is gone and for people like myself and my friends you are left with disappointment and a severe feeling of wasting your time. I will say I enjoyed the 27 hours I've put into the game my friends (between all of them 60 hours recorded) and I put all of the time and patience smacking walls and building up and up and up. I'm not joking when I say you couldn't see the top of our tower from the ground with the highest graphics settings and furthest distance set. Over 60 hours between us of building up making checkpoints smacking walls to upgrade them (at least 30 or 40 floors had all lvl 6 walls the highest lvl you can get at the moment) and lets not forget all of the defending from people that tried to raid us. So once again I will not lie to you I had a lot of fun in the time I played this game. But jumping on just to find out that everything you worked for no longer exists and you don't even have screen shots or any proof it becomes one of this gamers saddest moments in gaming. I am obvioiusly biased to why I am not recommending this game so I will say to everyone that may read this In my honest opinion you should wait to purchase this game until it has been completed and all the kinks worked out. Possibly by that point these mandatory wipes would only be on huge servers and if you just wanted to hang out with your friends and do crazy you could have smaller servers that don't wipe. Or perhaps even a LAN/single player setting to fufill peoples true sandbox needs (i.e. God complex). (As a side note for the buyers only trust a few from my experience there are a lot of people that will kill you without hesitation.) Now to explain Rust's positive points They are updating a lot and making great progress on the game. Crafting items harvesting and upgrading walls all take a good amount of time. But it could all be taken away if you don't watch your back or defend properly. As I said before the pvp is well managed and overall pretty realistic shoot someone with a bow in the right place and they may bleed out after one maybe two shots. There is the application of realism through hypotherma starving dehydrating and animals that will persue you. Since it is still in early access I assume they will work out the kinks of the unrealistic aspects and further implement more realistic survival features. The building in this game at first was a little complicated but given time by trial and error it can be quickly mastered. Basically double checking that your walls and floors are connected because if they are not whatever you are building will not be geometrically flawless. And nobody wants a building with gaps and unpreportioned sides. To wrap it up mandatory wipes of the servers ruined this game for me because I didn't know they existed. The pvp combat and building mechanics are well done for this game to not even be completed yet. But for people like myself if everything you work for in a game just disappears there is very little reason for me to play it. And as for people that this does not bother go ahead and get this game because it is fun to play. Though you may want to wait for them to be closer to completion or entirely done making the game. Sadly at this time I cannot recommend it. But I have a feeling they will fix most if not all the issues later. I sincerely hope this biased review actually helps people with their decision of whether to buy this game or not. Tl DR The combat and building mechanics are cool and I had fun playing this game. Built a enormous tower just to find out that the server wiped all the data. Feeling like I wasted time even though I enjoyed playing it. Purchase the game and find a server that doesn't wipe deal with wipes wait to purchase until they are done with the game or just don't buy it at all. Hope this helps and thanks for reading.,Rust

2014-11-08,0,0,127,True,Recommended,I personally love this game. I spend a lot of money each month to pay for a rust server. There are a ton of fair criticisms of the legacy version of this game. I find myself criticizing it all the time. But the weaknesses do not change how simply fun the game is to play and how amazing the concept is. While there are a TON of problems that irritate me to no end the game is incredibly unique and I continue to play it despite rage quitting a few times in the beginning. Once you get decent at the game it's incredibly fun. If you decide to play I strongly recommend looking for servers that have good 3rd party anti hack plugins installed. Cheatpunch does not really work anymore and the VAC banning system is totally unreliable and does not get people banned until months after they destroyed your base took all your stuff or spawn killed you repeatedly. If you're not into vanilla and would prefer to play on a gnarly arena/battle server I have some good recommendations for that as well but you will definitely find more hackers on most of those servers. I personally play on the arena servers for combat practice and my vanilla server for regular fun. The resource gathering risk of being raided and tedium of vanilla Rust are part of what makes the game so intense. The survival gathering building fighting and raiding concepts are all best experienced in combinatoin with one another which is why I prefer vanilla servers. However if you're just starting out I strongly recommend the following 1) get on a vanilla server to figure out how the mechanics work including survival gathering building etc. 2) get on a PVP server (where you spawn with guns) shortly thereafter to practice combat for a week or two so you can learn to use the guns in an environment where death doesn't cost you anything. 3) get back on a vanilla server to put those skills to use. If you only play on a vanilla server you won't get into enough serious fights to get very good at fighting. When you get in a fight on a vanilla server your heart will start pounding and it will be more intense than you'd feel in most other games because you are at risk of losing all of the stuff on your body and possibly the stuff in your base. If you go into this situation without any combat practice your own biological instincts will most likely screw you. But you can't get any real combat experience on a vanilla server because you will be so focused on escaping with your resources intact. Unfortunately running away is often not effective on vanilla servers if you are dealing with a skilled experienced player who will know how to easily dispatch an enemy who is running away. And if you get into fights on vanilla to try to get practice (starting with no experience) you have a very high risk of losing your weapons. If you lose all your weapons you won't be able to practice and progress. So it's much more practical to do all your practicing on a dedicated PVP server where there are no stakes and you get a gun every time you spawn. This way you can run straight into battle and shoot anyone you want with very little risk involved. Arena rust servers are basically like any other online first person shooter. Since Rust uses the unity engine it will feel quite a lot like Counter Strike or Team Fortress 2. Still it's got unique characteristics so you must practice Rust combat individually. When you hop on a PVP server just go wild and you'll end up teaching yourself how to survive and how to kill. I recommend looking up videos on youtube that describe some Rust combat techniques. I won't explain them in here but they can be very useful. There are a ton of non combat techniques used by tons of rust players as well so go practice and educate yourselves before committing a ton of time to gathering resources building and raiding. Make sure to build your base in a well hidden spot... because in your tenure with Rust you WILL get raided at least once if your base is visible and probably even if it's not visible. If you're on my server though you can't build fully inside rocks. You can build under rocks but no glitching inside rocks to throw down sleeping bags. If you do this you'll be automatically detected and banned on many good servers! Thx! ),Rust

2015-07-07,0,0,318,True,Recommended,Over 180 hours on this game and I have achived nothing. Servers get wiped all the time Updates are rushed and are really buggy. Community are horrible. Be prepared to build up lots of loot and have it instantly taken away from you. This game can and will make you very salty due to other peoples actions. *I have just written this review after I have played a very long t session full of The reason I recomend this game is because its fun to play with friends build a base and be successful. Its also fun hunting animals. Not all of the community are idiots some (but very few) are ok.

2016-04-08,0,0,67,True,Recommended,I LOVED the old versions of Rust(back when it had a single map) but now I find it slightly less enjoyable. I still think it can be a very fun game to play with a group of friends though.,Rust
2016-04-08,0,0,222,True,Recommended,"My concise review The Good Game mechanics are polished compared to other survival games. Hitting trees rocks is smooth. Running/walking is as you'd expect it. Shooting/body hitboxes are OK (could be a bit better). A lot of in game numbers are pretty well tweaked (how much wood/stone to make a safe house etc.) Large amount of people play meaning good variation in servers. Developers are good about responding to the community.The Bad No PvE element. Game is purely PvP. This means everything is optimized for PvP did you want to make a nice wooden hut that overlooks the landscape? Too bad you better make a honeycombed base made strictly out of stone unless you want to get raided immediately. Community is The game could be so fun if people cooperated yet there is an endless cycle of KOS (killing on sight) even if you are naked. Don't expect to productively cooperate with any group of people you don't know in real life.My advice is to get it because I think the developers are focusing on the right issues and a lot of what I listed in ""The Bad"" will hopefully get fixed over time.",Rust
2016-04-08,0,0,132,True,Recommended,So Point 1 Devs update this game nearly every week. Updates are consistent bug fixes and/or new content. Good start.Point 2 Crafting system is really in depth. Quite unlike other survival games in which you simply happen to find guns in this you can instead craft them which is rather helpful. And point 3 Most servers have a different map. This means not as much camping occurs at loot spots (at least in my experience with the game). So say goodbye to the annoying bandits you've come to know from DayZ and such like that camp all the loot locations. Sure you'll still find some but not as many.My one criticism of the game?I feel like this game should have craftable vehicles like little buggies or dirt bikes. Other than that?

2016-04-10,0,0,454,True,Not Recommended,"While it shows much promise I do not recommend Rust at this time unless all you want to do is mindless PvP.That means that the devs still have much to give players in terms of things to do that are not simply to run around killing innocents for their ""gear"". (Or just killing naked noobs for fun)Players need PvE content too and many more environment dangers other than the fear of encountering another player which 99.999% of the times results in that player trying to kill you.We need to fear some other dangers and we need some reason to band together for a common purpose.And of course there are a lot of hackers and cheaters.

Dont reccomend going to official servers since they are full players. (More filled servers are hard for new players since you die alot)I would reccomend going to a server with capacity of 100 and about 30 45 active players Max.Overall playerbase Depends on server. Most of the time I go and meet some friendly people. Some good players give you stuff to startout with other bad guys shoot you even before you can say Hi.Overall graphics Pretty good for alpha version reminds me of the game Delta force.Overall AI zombies were removed last patch. Still wolves are annoying its fun to kill bears though since they cant keepup with you.Overall summary Game is good for anyone who wants to play with friends and have some fun.

Here is what you can expect from Facepunch this is from the project lead quoted from the latest patch notes ""You know how you re all ing about optimization? When are we gonna optimize the game? I wish the game was optimized. You should take a week off and optimize the game. Well that s what we ve been doing so don t and moan that you don t have anything new to play with.""You are going to be punished for criticizing this game. Stop hiding behind 'Early Access'. Negative feedback is the most beneficial. So if a huge majority of your customers are saying this game runs poorly don't berate them take it as valuable feedback and fix the problem.The game itself can be a lot of fun but those moments where it shines are due to player interaction and the developers credit themselves far too much. Create a sandbox throw players in with very little limitations and suddenly you are an innovative genius? There is no discernible end goal here half implemented features create the illusion of a full experience but isolated from each other each mechanic is clearly feeble. Survival aspects are non existent (I will pay you if you can manage to starve to death in this game). Building/crafting features are a fraction of what is offered from similar titles. Gunplay needs a lot of work. To top it all off your playtime is completely redundant because you *will* be cheated by script kiddies.Let's not forget the intention of Early Access is stable full release (no homo).

2016-04-29,0,0,2197,False,Not Recommended,Very rough around the edges More recent patches and community behaviour almost insists for the best experience play with friends. Playing solo would make anyone quit in under 10 hours on some of the heavily populated servers.. But a good group will keep you coming back again and again and again.Being early access and weekly updates/changes going on it's always worthwhile to keep on top of glitches/bugs people may try and abuse to screw you over so you can accomodate to counter it.New game modes seem to be making their way in to being officially supported too (H1Z1 style Battle royale + Deathmatch servers). Developers embracing this kind of community is always a good thing and adds extra hours of fun. Post release review update While it can be fun Can't really recommend playing more than the weekend after a fresh reset with the game in it's current meta (And unless you get lucky Don't expect to play with much above bows/single fire weapons without hours of grinding)... massive groups form together and dominate a server making any lasting time you put into farming/building meaningless.,Rust

After all all you have to do to succeed is stay on longer than the other people on your server and you can steal their effort assuming someone doesn't beat you to it.It has nudity so it will appeal to your childish and hormone ridden senses.

But recently they have been listening too much to the toxic community of this game and their reviews. The most recent update as of 10/17/17 has basically ruined the game but they are headed in the right direction with the game. They added blueprints back which was a big step in the right direction yet they mixed it in with the component system and added ""workbenches."" Overall I think the developers should keep doing what they are doing and listen to the fans but don't completely change it due to fans opinions. Edit As of 1/13/18 they have ruined their own game. I barely play anymore because it just got boring. I will play and run into a 12 man group and I'm better off handing them my loot even though I wouldn't be able to do that because everyone in this game is extremely toxic and will KOS.",Rust

However the game its self may have a beautiful cover but the content of the book is horrificly bad. You can build a small hut you can get some more wood ohh wait someone has killed you because they think that it was funny to steal all your sh*t right after watching you bulid it. Okay now respawn and start again go to hit tree for wood ohh look you've been killed by someone with a bow.Okay start again you die again and again and again.I do not see how anyone who doesnt spend 20hrs on the same server can find this any fun.

2018-04-25,0,0,819,False,Recommended,My Review on Rust Solo play I've played solo on rust many times on many different official and modded servers.. Personaly being average at first person shooters i have to say that this is hard for me but rewarding in it's difficulty. Tons of people are constantly looking to recruit and group so finding friends shouldn't be hard however.... IT IS RUST... U WILL BE SHOT NAKED A COUPLE TIMES..Group Play This is where all the fun is... You are less likely to die in a group of 3 or more as you have different angles of coverage when fighting enemies or raiding resources.Personaly sometimes it feels as tho people are not playing fairly when 1 guy runs up and kills your group with an AK. I don't understand how people can just hold down the trigger on an AK and not hit the clouds like i do when i hold down the trigger.... Guess it's practice or aim bots or whatever.Previously i would have given this game an 8/10 for overall combat and content. However since the release of Boats and water travel... This game has been bumped in my mind from an 8/10 to a 9/10...Combat 9/10 (Apart from AK wielding A holes who pray and spray your whole party for headshots it's good)Adventure 10/10 (With the new Boats and water travel system you can legit go wherever u want)Resource grind 10/10 (It's not hard or boring as your constantly on the lookout and resources are everywhere)Building 10/10 (One of the only games out there where you can build where you want and what you want)Player to Player interactions 8/10 (There are going to be a holes in every game. But every now and again you meet cool people)+1 for the introduction to safe Trading system,Rust

If you like constantly dying and starting over play on an official server or simply a crowded one. The game itself is addicting with loads of room to add content. Up to last week I had been relatively impressed with communication from developers and patch content. Last weeks patch broke the game for Vista users (others too but can't quite recall the specific systems). One pathetic comment on twitter responded to issue since then nothing. No fixes no communication no support from community other than ridicule that there are people that still use Vista.,Rust

2018-06-24,0,0,101,False,Recommended,Almost 100 hours just a brief review on this game. I haven't played Rust for a while it's always such a fun game to come back onto the only sad thing about this game is how consistent you need to be as in you always need to play almost daily otherwise you'll have to reset. Takes a lot of work to build up and more likely will be teamed so I recommened playing with others. I wouldn't say the game is bad at all though it has been improving constantly and is always worked on since it came out. If you go to play this game always have friends to join and help and if you think you can consistently play it daily.,Rust

2016-04-24,0,0,283,True,Recommended,Summary Enjoyable game if playing with friends that REQUIRES lots of time to really enjoyPositives If you have the time to invest in gathering resources building bases starting over after setbacks and deaths then RUST is a very rewarding fun game. To go from a naked who cannot defend himself against anything or anyone to a raider who wields immense power and control makes for a very captivating game.Negatives You need hours and hours of grinding away to get the resources to start becoming successful and self sufficient in this game. However you will die very often due to the fact that all humans are resources in this game to other players and are harvested as such. If you do not have the ability to start over from scratch almost effectively undoing hours of work then you will not enjoy this game.,Rust

2018-04-16,0,0,1,False,Not Recommended,This game is not what I expected it to be. First off all it is soooooo long loading times. Especially if you join a different map that you havent played on before. 2nd of all you cant play private match. You have to join a public server wheere everyone kills you and destroy what you have built. So if you have just bought the game you have to expect to play a lot before you even get to build a base that can stand for more than 10 min. I will NOT recommend this game to anyone.

We must remember the Cowlamo and what we Cows utterly suffer that day. Our ancestor the Cowrokee had proud utters and prime beef muscles. Then the White man from Cowbra Kai thought their martial arts could beat us. So the tournament began. We fought hard but soon our utters shrivel up like Jeff s Mom saggy tater tots. We soon fall short as our Cow Fu was no match. They soon took over and cowmanded us to pick cowton. As tell past a fortuneteller named Cowthsayer foretold the prophecy through her cowuldron of a black and white cowarrior. This mighty hulk of beef would cowush them. Back to the dictator of Cowbra Kai he made the slaves to build a Cowthedral to worship his immortally. Then back to real life I killed my friend Jeff in his sleep and his mom vigorously till the backbone broken in half. The half dead horse limping and twitching in agony I decided to end her misery.

2014-02-14,0,0,51,True,Recommended,Have you played Minecraft? (your answer better be yes) If so then you'll feel right at home in this game. It's basically the same except the graphics aren't blocky and 8 bit looking. You start out with a rock(weapon) 3 bandages and a torch. From your fresh spawn you go and collect materials some to build structures some to craft clothing other to craft weapons and usuable items. Now this isn't exactly like Minecraft the house or base building is alot more satisfying in my opinion. You start with foundation then pillars then walls ceilings doors crates to hold your items etc. You also need to defend yourself and your home from other players. Think smart when designing your home make false rooms traps and so forth to prevent other players from getting to your goodies. At this point the game is still in Alpha so there are alot of changes being made. Some things might stay other will be taken out. I haven't really come across any bugs or glitches yet but everyones time playing is different. Rust is an amazing game a very addictive game the day I bought it I played for 8 hours straight. I continued over the next few days learning how everything works. Your first spawn will be quite tough if you have no idea what your doing but keep at it and in no time you will be enjoying it!,Rust

2014-10-10,0,0,3,True,Not Recommended,The only game in Early access state is probably KSP this is useless and absolutelly not enjoyable game at this stage it should be at least somehow balanced so people dont close the game after one hour of gameplay because some psychopatic kids keeps shooting you and calling you noob. Steam should reconsider giving developers option to sell EA games or at least force them to sell it for much cheaper while it is in state of developement. So many new dodgy developers with their early access games for 18 or more GBP. Nope thats just not right. I have seen one EA game here on Steam selling for around 18 GBP while it hasnt been updated for months and DEV dont communicate with community he fired PR guy he does not respond to any messages and game is absolutelly broken and misadvertized I wonder why Steam is letting such a wonkers to rob people.,Rust
2014-05-26,0,0,30,True,Not Recommended,Rust is not really worth the buy at it's current stage as you probably have heard it has the worst community of squeakers thinking they are badass because they have 3 friends and some guns and ruin your experience over some wood.It also takes forever to build a house but some servers fix this with starter packs and instacraft and other mods.They seem to be making major strides in the remake that they are doing but who knows how long that's gonna take?There are some funny situations that you can get into in this game however.I really felt a thrill when three guys in kevlar armor raided my house that took me maybe five hours to build and all I had to defend myself was a homemade shotgun but after they killed me all I really felt was frustration.Think of this as more of a MMO deathmatch with bases. 6/10,Rust

You will be greeted with some of the best devs on the planet where you will be receiving weekly updates and fun small stories made by the dev team almost daily.

2014-01-20,0,0,41,True,Not Recommended,"Great idea I watched lots of videos before purchasing and it looked awesome and then I played it. When this game says it's in Alpha beta I must say that's an understatement. The ""no pvp"" servers don' exist so if that's your thing wait for it to get fixed. It's true that you can't be killed while you're awake that is however it isn't considered pvp to beat your door down while you're out or even standing in your house and steal everything you own. People literally wait outside of houses for others to log off so they can break in and destroy everything you have and ""kill"" you on a ""no pvp no sleepers"" server. My experience in this game was frustrating and I quickly got the feeling I was playing with a juvenile community. The profanity was horrible and with no filter I ended up just filtering it all (there's an option to shut off chat). For Beta this was my first experience where you can't report anything while in game and their website didn't seem any better for responding. So if being swore at endlessly chased acrossed the map by a horde of people with guns and starting a game from scratch every day is your thing then this just may be for you ) So to sum it up the idea fantastic this game terrible. Don't be fooled the ones who love it are the ones who want to kill you and steal your gear. There are no friends in Rust only enemies... eventually.",Rust

2014-02-15,0,0,16,True,Not Recommended,So far unplayable on my 2011 MacBook Pro. I have never had this issue with any other game on this computer but it crashes constantly.

Or while I am just walking. Or many times it spawns me into the world and then freezes immediately.So far I haven't gotten more than 3 minutes into the game so I really can't recommend it until it works on my computer.

2014-02-15,0,0,141,True,Recommended,Beautiful for an alpha game. It still has a lot of bugs but that is expected. The creators seem to be fixing them as they appear so the bugs dont last for long. This game is NOT noob friendly so those looking to get in find a few friends and try to survive in a group.

Agree to disagree if you enjoy this.**UPDATE** 1 20 14 So I grew restless about Rust this last weekend and gave it another shot. This time I picked a less populated server and met a couple people that actually ""got it"" and asked me to join their posse instead of just beating me to death with rocks. When we were four strong and had a base I was having a great time. I didn't realize how utterly lacking this game is trying to solo things. It still doesn't make it a perfect game but in a group its a lot better. So much so in fact I can barely stand to play it as I constantly encounter dickery when I try to get people to let me join them.

There's plenty of bugs in this game (laser sights not aiming where they should players being almost blinded by darkness and blackholes ripping the sky asunder etc.) but if you like survival (DayZ) building (Minecraft) and have a willingness to help fellow survivors. Then this will quickly become one of your favorite games. If you're afraid the Developers won't finish the game don't Facepunch Studios are a devoted group of people who love games as we do.

2017-12-29,0,0,14,True,Recommended,Rust Review Over the past few hours of playing this game I've really enjoyed it! It's hard at first but after a while I got the hang of it. The only issue I've encountered with this game so far is that there is no character customization. Apart from this I enjoy this game alot and would recommend it.,Rust
2018-02-19,0,0,137,False,Recommended,with my limited time with this game I have come to the conclusion that this game can be mind bogglingly amazing and no fun at all sometimes you get a base setup and sometimes somebody kills you and takes all of your stuff sometimes you get raided and sometimes you do the raiding. The game in my expiriance has been very situational mabey you build your base hidden behind some rocks and then all of a sudden somebody with loads of gear builds on the other side of the rock formation without seeing your base and then when he sees it he decides it would be a good idea to burn down your poor little shack and take your 1 singular hatchet that you spent an hour trying to get because you kept on getting killed I will now recount one of my expiriances in this game me you know I think i'll build behind this pile of rocks in order to keep my base hiddennon descript guy with no clothes you know I think i'll build my house in the woods near that rock formationtwo annoying 14 year olds lets build our base right in between the woods and that rock formation!guy with a crossbow hey I see like 4 people over there building let me go murder them!me oh sh*t that guy with a crossbows running right at me!two annoying 14 year olds hey see that guy lets go scream curses and sh*t at him!non descript guy with no clothes god f*cking dammit more people here to kill meme SH*T SH*T SH*T!

Stick it through and you will find one of the most addictive and deep games out there.At the advanced stage you will find yourself locked into territorial wars with your neighbors negotiating alliances and tuce's breaking bonds and sneaking around leveling the bases of your enemikes. In other words at high level this game can be Game of Thrones.Take note that the official serrvers are NOT your only option. If you want to play solo go find a solo/duo/trio server lest you be killed over and over by zergs. Noobs may want to find a ""noob friendly"" server where you are less likely toi face toxic people and other players will teach you and help you out. Don't start out on a hardcore top end server face to face with all the twitch streamers and then get upset because you couldn't compete!Anyways I've put hundreds of hours in this game that should speak for itself.",Rust

2014-01-21,0,0,38,True,Not Recommended,"Not worth the money at this point full of hackers not much content and the game is overrun with hackers cheaters and power abusing administrators. If your not one of these three types of player then you're entire point in the game is to give those players someone to annoy grief and taunt (via a voice chat that you can't disable) you constantly. Even the players that don't cheat grief or taunt you will still kill you partly because the community around Rust is just that bad but mostly because the game REQUIRES it of them. They cannot trust other players ever and have no way of knowning if you are really a new naked player or if you're carrying an invisible shotgun. I did manage to have a great time playing this game with my friends on an otherwise empty server but that server went down and all of our progress was lost so we decided to try a populated server only to find that it was a completely pointless thing to do. There is no place on a server with more than 10 people where you will be left alone long enough to gather the materials needed to make even a basic house... and even if you somehow DO manage to build yourself a little castle with a stout metal door it won't last the night because ""bandits"" wait for you to log of so that they can go to your base blow it up with C4 murder you in your sleep take all of your stuff then destroy your ability to respawn. Yes that is right the griefers can grief you even when you're not playing!!PVE servers are not the answer either because they do not protect you from ""raiders"" (e.g. 12 year olds who have figured out how to dupe C4) that will blow up your house and steal all of your stuff. If you enjoy bashing yourself in the face with a hammer you'll love Rust... otherwise stay away.",Rust

2014-01-21,0,0,91,True,Not Recommended,The words alpha beta early access do not make this game any less of a game that should be reviewed AS IT IS. If you are to pay $20 for this product you must understand that you are playing this with a guarantee that this is an unfinished product and that more things will be added in the future. With that in mind I would NOT recommend this game until it is further updated. The skeleton of the game is fun. As an online MMO gameplay fidelity suffers from the mechanic's lack the polish and shine. It is great when it works. It's irritating when it doesn't. This is a game where survival and hording are necessary to stay alive from the most dangerous enemies human players. Many previews/reviews of this game say that it is a mix between Minecraft and DayZ. Having played Minecraft and not DayZ I can make certain assumptions about this game.First of all do not be fooled this game is only similar to Minecraft in the fact that it has survival in the description. You can craft items weapons and shelters. You do have (AT THE CURRENT STATE OF THE GAME) the ability to be creative with what structures you build but you're still limited by what you can make. In other words most human made structures are like the building's that you can see in the above screenshots. This does not mean that you can create things like pistons switches keys for doors ect. You have walls ceilings windows and door (ONE DOOR ONE PLAYER!). Then you can build 2 types of storage boxes workbench furnace survival equipment ect. You also do not have the ability to coordinate locations as there arent any compasses or maps. Placing a sleeping bag within your base is the only way to spawn in a desired location. The best (non base) strategy to coordinate locations with friends is to use already existing structures as permanent points of reference. Aside fromFun factors will be dependent upon gameplay strategies. If you are the type whom likes to play lone wolf good luck. Most parties of players run together and too often will shoot those who look well equiped. Small human structures are easily broken into and large structures are generally sought out for breaking into. The strategy for avoiding player intrusion is to build small metal and remote. Getting anywhere takes forever so nesting close to the road (main area where players roam and where structures are) is ideal. Most raw materials do not spawn too far away from the roaded area this forces players to bottleneck into a third of the map and does not take advantage of the massive range of places in the game. The true fun will be derived from player interactions not from actual gameplay mechanics. Player gameplay will range from mugging robbing assisting and murdering. THIS IS WHY PEOPLE SHOULD BUY THIS GAME. Experiences in this game are going to be relative to how you play when you play and who you play with. I recommend that you play this game with friends and only with friends. This is a crude review and does not cover all specific aspects of the game. I have had much fun with this game but given the lack of permanence and things to do I have lost much of my interest in it.,Rust
2014-01-21,0,0,1404,True,Recommended,awesome,Rust
2014-01-21,0,0,22,True,Recommended,I tried out rust on a few practice servers before joining a community one and really trying. The chances are that every now and then your first spawn will be next to a zombie. My friend spawned for the first time next to three rocks one wood pile and a zombie couldn't fight off the zombie and died instantly. Just today before I could even see I spawned next to the stronger type of zombie and died before I could move.However! Don't let this put you off as on your third spawn or so things are looking up! My first two days have just been completed today (45 minute days and 15 minutes night times in case you were curious) and on my first night I spawned in near pitch black. My recommendation if this happens is to go as close to the nearest small shack as possible you can sometimes even stay warm. Once it was morning I was able to get enough wood to make my own tiny wooden shack pretty close to supply spawn points. The best thing to do in this game is make friends. Without friends you will die. A very helpful player called Hypno was helping myself and another (presumably) noob. We were even given supplies and a place to sleep for the night. Don't be afraid to ask for help sometimes you can get some awesome stuff.For an Alpha game this is really well developed and it's very realistic and generally awesome. I get a lot of lag on my computer but other than that I highly recommend Rust! I've already gotten many friends to download it too!Be warned that as of now you can't connect to a server from Mac but you can get Bootcamp for Mac and run Windows on Mac which is what I have done to play Rust.Keep up the great work guys!,Rust

If you enjoy discovering new things you can get that monthly as the developers are the best in the business at keeping up with updates and content additions. If you enjoy interaction you can certainly do that. Just remember though this is Rust and not your mother's backyard.

Coming back to my base a week later and find nothing is left is just depressing. All that hard work wasted. It's fun to play for a few few hours just don't put too much time and effort on making security and decorating your home because nothing is impenetrable even if you have the strongest walls and the most hidden location. At least it's better than DayZ.,Rust
2017-09-10,0,0,106,True,Recommended,"Lust for Rust!I played the original game briefly and then stopped when anti cheat first came in which stopped me using my steam controller. Recently this has been fixed and now im back and I gotta say this is WITHOUT DOUBT the best survival game out there. I've played them all but Rust is sooo polished and good looking. And everything is so smooth and works so nice the simple slick interface is a joy!I am looking at the game through fresh eyes and I would encourage those people with any doubt to try doing that also. I appreciate some players have been with this game for a very long time and may feel somehow cheated by the way it's changed and the decisions made. But those guys need to let it go now. Change is sometimes a hard thing to accept but it's a good thing because this game in my oppinion has never been this fantastic until now! Seriously.. the community is both a credit and a problem for this game. Great that it's so big... but blimey is it toxic in places so please judge with your own eyes and bring a fresh perspective.I love the way they have gone about this game and tried to be a little different. I love the fact that you don't create your character and you are forced to learn to live with what they give you. I love my black guy with a smaller than everage endowment and anybody who tries to make fun will get my mace over their head in the night while they are sleeping!I love the newer art style... a really nice (slightly cartoon) style that allows the game to look both mean and gritty at times and yet still a bit soft. Fantastic job!The sound effects and the little animations for everything... I mean jeez the attention to detail is so high. Some triple A titles don't get worked on this hard!Community around any game is going to be fickle and I think sometimes with this game some people got too used to a good thing and got thoroughly spoilt! Anytime they feel like the game isn't so good they should try playing any of the other survival games... The Forest Conan Exiles Osiris New Dawn 7 Days to die or H1Z1 just survive... which will remind them just how spoilt they are.Don't get me wrong all those games I have mentioned are brilliant games and it would be a little unfair to compare them as they are different. But I can compare them based upon polish and attention to detail and I just don't think they are as good. Rust's sheer imagination and detail can only have been created through real effort time and talent on behalf of the dev team. They obviously are passionate about this game otherwise it just simply wouldn't look so good or play as well as it does.RUST is shining like a diamond and not ""rusty"" at all. My biggest congratulations to Gary and the devs on this game. With the hateful comments they have received from the disgruntled minority in the past it must have made them feel like giving up on the community at times. I for one am glad they didn't and that Gary has the right attitude to deal with the haters. I can't wait for the game to continue forwards and I will be there every step of the way with my rifle in hand and my face mask pulled firmly down!11/10 !!!!",Rust

2014-09-11,0,0,41,True,Recommended,I did a review on Rust a few months back not really explaining much and just saying that the game is nice. And to be honest the game is amazingly fun but get's boring in the long run. Grab a few friends purchase this game all together and play on the same server. Skype while doing this find eachother build your own fortress and have lots of fun. To sum it all together Rust is an amazing game to play with friends. Playing it alone is horrifying and not recommended. As I said grab a few friends play together and have a blast. You'll eventually get tired of the game once you've been raided like 147 times in a row but that's alright.8/10,Rust

Find a GOOD SERVER that has good admins that maintain trolls or even maintain a PVE only server. That way you can learn and build without the threat of other players trolling you. After MODDED GAMES ARE WHERE ITS AT!!!!! I am on RusticNation PVE and it's a blast. good community of players. In short you can have a good or very bad experience with the game based on what server you decide to play on. I hated this game in early access but now find myself spending 10 hours at a time in it.

2014-01-22,0,0,195,True,Recommended,I've been playing quite a bit of Rust recently and am super impressed with what Garry and his team have done. The game is fiarly easy to pick up on you'll die a few times before you get a handle on how to survive. But once you do it you start rolling pretty fast and can get a decent base pretty quick. But be sure to make friends without them holding a base on any PvP server is nigh impossible. If you want to enjoy the game without the prospect of getting gunned down and all your hard work torn to the ground the PvE servers are very enjoyable and have a great community. Also the craftiing system in the game is engaging and builds on itself. In conclusion I would suggest this game to anyone who enjoys Minecraft or DayZ as this game is about as close as you can get to a comination of the two.And the game is still in Alpha so more greatness is to come!,Rust

2015-01-30,0,0,1226,True,Recommended,"I have mixed feelings about Rust. First of all I see and hear a lot of complaints that compare the current version to legacy wherein people complain about the lack of content in the new version. My issue with this complaint is that each and every person who paid for this game saw the trailers for legacy which is still available to play and purchased based on that. Are the mechanics of new rust as good as legacy yet? Yes and no. Take for example the new building system. It has bugs of its own like house pieces spawning with 0 health and staying that way not allowing the player to place an house piece without reason and house pieces breaking upon placement usually pillars and always without reason. That being said it is vastly superior to that of legacy. Other things just frustrate veteran players of Rust like the total inability to raid without exploiting glitches. The graphical map generation and recent UI updates really make the game a lot more fun and less annoying but that being said the map generation needs more variety. I remember actually being able to hide your base in old Rust but that is essentially impossible in the new version. Animal AI is currently buggy as hell RAM use is absurd and there are some things that seem simple that haven't yet been implemented. For example the clothing currently has no affect besides aesthetic changes to the player experience. No protection from radiation heat or bullets is provided. It seems to me that it would be very easy to add a textureless tool that could be used to stop building part health regen allowing raiding. In the same vein as old Rust you only get wolf meat even though bear meat exists in the game in airdrops. My big complaints about new Rust are that it's easy and there's nothing to do. First let's talk about the lack of challenge. Once you have a stone base you're invincible unless one or more very dedicated people comes and finds a glitched wall (which I admit I have done many times) and gathering the materials for a house is easy. There is little gun variety and the AK currently dominates. The bolt action is more or less useless due to the lack of a scope. Anyone with an AK can defend their base for forever. You don't starve anymore. Your hunger ticks down at a snail's pace and you needn't ever worry about it. This is where the ""like Minecraft but with FPS graphics"" statements that are so often applied to Rust seem to hold the most water. You reach endgame fast and there's very little to do once you do so. And even on the way the things you can do are very limited. There's no need to hunt very limited ability to raid firefights are laggy and uncontrollable and the way Rust works building isn't *fun*. I have hope yet for the future of Rust and am glad that in addition to killing your friends you can now cook and eat them! I hope to see added to the game General bugfixesMore wildlife varietyDeep explorable caves with valuable resourcesMore terrain varietyOptimizationImproved combatMore distinct landmarks with actual strategic importanceThe ability to legitimately raidFarming and miningServerwide eventsChallengeAll in all Rust remains fun in short stints. I have faith but wish the dev team would produce content a touch faster.11/10 best gaem evr",Rust

2018-07-10,0,0,2701,False,Recommended,This is the most brutal game I have ever played not for the blood and gore but for the feeling of cruelty and sense of loss. For some reason it plays with my morality and natural insticts. I dont feel good killing or raidng someone and taking everything they collected for hours days weeks or maybe a month for no reason but my insticts wont let me allow a possible threat to grow and threaten my base. but thats me maybe your the type to set up a base on the beach and shoot defenceless nakeds all day as they spawn in and try and make it inland. I highly (cough cough) recommend trying this game. 10 out of 10 for concept. IMO8 out of 10 for execution. I'm not sure how to describe this game It's kinda a (HARDCORE survival) / Basebuilding / crafting / first person shooter / open world map kinda game.Hunting people in this game can be very intense especially if you are poorly armed.shooting feels alright it's just hard enough to make it a challenge decent weapons and attachmets and ammo types(assualt rifles sniper smg shotguns lasers scopes silencers)decent crafting sytems for items and weapons fun building system,Rust

2014-02-18,0,0,64,True,Recommended,A brutal open world survival game with an even more harsh learning curve making the novice die time after time from animal attacks other players and starvation. This game will have you furious at neer'do wells who get you when your back's turned and heart pumping when its the other way round and you creep up on un suspecting players with a mere rock in hand and an empty belly desperate for their food and supplies. With an interesting crafting side and a unique gaming experience when playing with friends making forts or going it alone remaining hidden and low key a definite must try for any Survival Simulation fan. However the downside is I sincerely hope the game improves overall 14.99 is just too much to pay from my experience so far I respect it's still in Early Access though.,Rust

2015-06-30,0,0,696,True,Recommended,Rust what can i say about rust. I had never played a survival sandbox type game prior to my purchase of rust. I started playing during the first incarnation or legacy rust. I didn't know any of the mechanics when i jumped in which i believe was why i had such a thrilling experience my first couple weeks. I remember playing one of my first days and had built myself a little wooden shelter. The beggining ones in legacy While sitting by a fire waiting for the daylight to come back some guy decided to sit outside and taunt me with sexual comments. How he was going to come in an stick his member in my behind lol. So i opened my door and shot him in the chest with an arrow. Then i watched his naked little butt wiggle as he ran away with an arrow through his body into the darkness until he was no longer visible. Lol golden moments like these are what make rust worth buying. Sure there are a ton of People who want nothing more then to kill you take your stuff and get under your skin while doing so. Somtimes these people become overbearing and a couple week break from rust is needed. Anything can happen in this game for good or bad.,Rust

2015-06-30,0,0,34,True,Recommended,The game is fun only if you have at least 3 4 friends and you can put in 3 4 hours each everyday. The game has a wipe system that just erases everything on the server you are in. The server wipes every 5 days depending on the server. This system is good for keeping the game fair but impossible for those who can only put an hour or two a day. So if you have the time and friends then the game is super fun but if not well stick to LOL. PS I heard the wipes are temp so hopefully when the game is fully complete there will be a better system.,Rust

I don't mind getting killed just wish I could play the game more than 30 seconds before starting over again. The PVE aspect was pretty bad that people could shoot your buildings down when you wanted to build a nice place. If you want to constantly die and really like messing around with a bunch of naked cavemen then this game is for you. 4/10 if you got burned by the candle hat.,Rust

2014-06-26,0,0,34,True,Not Recommended,UPDATE One year later and nothing substantial has changed. It's laggy takes forever to connect and has the most toxic griefer community of any game I've ever played. I suspect it will be in alpha for another year or two and maybe by then they will have implemented some meaningful changes that will make it playable for anyone who isn't a hacker or part of a 30+ clan of jackhole dickbags. Until then I would avoid it at all costs. Original Review I wish I could recommend Rust. I really do. The premise is awesome the gameplay and mechanics have a solid foundation and the pedigree of the developer is without question. But the game itself is just unplayable. Lag is constant bandits are everywhere and hackers are omnipresent. Your typical session in Rust will play out like this Spawn beat on stuff with a rock build a shelter get shot by some random . Spawn beat on stuff with a rock get shot by 2 random s. Spawn beat on stuff with a rock build an awesome hidden base get raided by a hacker or a group of 10 random s with more c4 than God. All the while expereinceing persistent lag and stutters that make PVP a game of who lags first at the wrong time. It's just a mess in it's current state and the updates over the past year have been a complete joke. Avoid this until further progress has been made.,Rust
2015-07-02,0,0,69,True,Not Recommended,Unless you plan on playing all day everyday with a group of friends doing the same don't bother as this game requires that sort of commitment to achieve any sort of success or progress.

2018-07-08,0,0,300,False,Recommended,Personally I think this is the best multiplayer survival game out here mostly because of the complecated yet simple crafting system they put in place(Hard to learn easy to master). Other than the blueprint update and the twig update (which significantly changed how people played the game) its been continuously growing since release. I recommend you pick it up you will have a lot of fun no matter how many people you have. Oh and btw this game is heavily pvp based so get gud. 1g reference anybody?,Rust

2015-09-25,0,0,969,False,Recommended,Rust is a game that you either love or hate. I personally love and hate Rust I love Rust because I enjoy the survival concept of the game and the building your own little or big base feature to keep all your loot safe. I also love the new Team Feature that was recently added to the game it makes it easier to keep track of where your friends have run off to! It also makes combat simpler if you are with a team of friends so you know which person to not shoot at in an intense battle. There are a lot more reasons why I like Rust but I have one reason why I hate it. The one thing I hate about Rust is the community. The community is very toxic and salty and very unfriendly. Now I m not the sort of person who normally gets mad over a game but the other players on this game somehow make you feel so aggressive by either teasing you in chat or talking a load of rubbish after they kill you. But overall I think this game is a good game and if the community wasn t so toxic I would honestly rate it 10 out of 10.But if you can deal with the toxic players then go for it and buy it. You can always get a refund if you don t enjoy the game.,Rust

2018-06-07,0,0,1372,False,Recommended,Loved playing this game and seeing it grow up. The developers have put real effort into listening to the community and also keeping them happy with scheduled updates. When you quit the game for a few months and come back you won't be dissapointed with the new content that keeps getting added to the game. Only downside is that in the early days of rust nobody knew what they were doing and you would find yourself in the most peculiar situations and strange/faulty base designs. Unfortunately it's gotten so big that people play according to meta's and pre determined base designs big groups and zerging.If you don't have a big group to play with i would recommend looking for a limited group server like duo or trio etc.,Rust

2018-06-07,0,0,3,False,Recommended,The game Rust the review of which is presented in this article was developed by the English company Facepunch Studios. The source was the Source engine. The appearance of the game was influenced by such projects as Stalker and DayZ. The first versions were significantly different from what is in the game today. Only thanks to many improvements and additions to the game there were a lot of opportunities.Background on December 11 2013 the date of the appearance of Rust. You should start the game review from this moment. Initially on Rust no one had high hopes. However after two weeks the number of copies sold sold over one hundred and fifty thousand which indicates a great popularity among gamers. After only a year namely in January 2014 the best selling game was exactly Rust. The review on it at that time could be found on almost all game resources. February of the same year was the moment when the number of sales exceeded one million.The creation of the game was the same studio that developed the famous Garry's Mod. Those who know him know that he is distinguished by a huge variety of game. The game owes an abundance of all modes first of all to the head of the company Facepunch Studios Harry Newman. Thanks to his love of diversity in Rust the review of which is presented in the article there is a huge number of objects with excellent detail. In addition the game is not deprived of regular additions and improvements which bring a lot of innovations in the gameplay. Separation As already mentioned above the developer's studio is very scrupulous about its product which led to the emergence of two projects Rust and Rust Experimental. An overview of this branch is also presented in the article. The division was due to the fact that the company considered the game code as not perfect and soon it was decided to create another parallel project.Soon after the release of the Experimental gaming community shared. After all they were presented with two completely different products having the same name Rust. The review of the game in Russian became even more relevant as many gamers wanted to know the differences. Initially the offshoot was not perceived by players as a full fledged game. Rather it was considered a project for developers to test. Many gamers felt that the creation of a completely new project is pointless. Rust was a good game which needed to get rid of cheaters and improve graphics. However after about two years when Experimental received significant improvements gamers began to treat it much better and many even abandoned the original Rust.DevelopmentOver time the first project completely turned into Rust Legacy. The review of the game continues from the moment when the original Rust almost completely ceased to be updated and was abandoned by many gamers. However I should say a few flattering words about the Rust Legacy. The game has an amazing atmosphere and excellent mechanics. In the meantime Experimental has more beautiful graphics and details of every detail. While reviewing the game Rust we can not help saying that its development and improvement are still occurring. Developers regularly release updates that make improvements to every minor part of the game.Game processSo after considering the main points of the emergence and development of Rust let's move directly to the game process. The main task before the gamer is survival. The game starts with a minimum set of items in the backpack. Other resources will have to be obtained on their own. In order not to die of hunger it is necessary to hunt and to build a dwelling to engage in the extraction of wood. Of course the game is more interesting and fun (and even easier) to play in the company of friends. The group is much easier to fight off enemies and get food. The player will have to constantly struggle with various difficulties hunger radiation attacks of people and animals and so on. At the very beginning of the game the gamer can create only the most necessary items. To obtain new skills to create you have to kill animals and also check chests.SurvivalDuring the day the player has nothing to be afraid of and can freely explore the area and extract resources. In principle this process is very similar to the popular game Minecraft. It's better to wait in a safe place. With the onset of the night zombies are beginning to wander and it is very difficult to obtain any resources. Especially you can see at a distance no more than a meter. However if you find yourself in the dark do not despair. In the inventory there is a torch that will light the way. In the game there are various factors that affect the state of the character. Avoiding radiation and cold is easy enough but it's difficult to fight with hunger. We'll have to hunt and get food all the time. When the critical level of hunger is reached the character will die.Crafting In the game it is presented quite diverse. You can create a lot of different things from items for the home ending with weapons. At the first stages of the game will be quite difficult. However when the player has the most necessary tools an ax a pickax and so on it becomes much easier. Resources in Rust are limited. For example a character can not get more than nine boards from a tree. In general the extraction of a tree often turns into a rather difficult task. Sometimes a player is lucky and he finds himself in the forest more often and sometimes in the desert where there are practically no trees. The stone is much easier to find. It comes across almost everywhere but it takes a pick to extract it. Other resources are less common and additional tools are often needed to extract them. In this case often will have to compete for rare items with other players.,Rust

You go to sleep. Get up and then suddenly you have been raided by hackers. They c4 the walls right where the Cupboard is. I've seen so many times them raiding even when i was online and still going stright to the Cupboard. They still exist because the anti cheat is Even if they get banned they will start over on fresh account since you can get Rust game cheap during the sales. Overwall its a good game its fun but play only if you dont mind grinding resources and then getting raided the next morning.,Rust

2018-07-15,0,0,79,False,Recommended,This really is a good game despite the often toxic community. It takes a lot of knowledge and a lot of luck to progress in Rust. Knowledge of the best weapons and armor to use which barrels will drop what the best monuments to scour for resources player hotspots to avoid being killed constantly how to solve certain puzzles at monuments and base building techniques to avoid being raided. I played Rust during early access and absolutely hated it. I hated it because hardly anything was explained and I was getting killed a lot. There is certainly a steep learning curve to this game. Luckily there are a lot of YouTube videos online to help you get ahead of the curve. After some time you will get into the flow of things and begin to realize that it's not so bad after all. If you're new there are plenty of low pop servers as well as RP solo and no KOS servers. It often will help to team up with a more experienced player to learn from and the game is overall easier as a team. Rust has a variety of things to do always keeping you busy. It can become very addicting when you start to gain some traction on a new server. Rust does have a very toxic community. Players especially clans with no remorse for your lack of experience young children who insult you and your mother and people who will lie through their teeth to get ahead of you and players who will capture you to turn you into a slave or torture toy. On the other hand the more mature and experienced players I find are typically willing to help and answer any questions you have they want the community to grow. Keep in mind there are glitches from time to time which get abused and can be game breaking but the developers tend to fix them swiftly and also release updated weekly regardless. Overall Rust is a very well polished game with dedicated developers. It takes time to get used to but is fun and enjoyable when you do. I recommend this to anyone who has a large reserve of patience and time or has friends to play with.,Rust

2015-07-19,0,0,657,True,Recommended,I started playing this game right when it came out on steam early access and I was instantly addicted. And in all honesty it was one of the most exciting and thrilling multiplayer games I had ever played. Its hard to put it into words just how intense this game got. I was with about 15 20 people all working together to build a base and collect rescources to put toward raiding other clans basses/camps/bunkers/forts. Its impossible to describe how intense it is to go on a night raid with about 10 15 people and raid another clans base while they are IN IT! Back in those days really all you could do was break into someones base with C4. So you would start to blow doors to get in while enemy players would try and sneak out of their base to flank you and people from windows firing at you. And if you did get killed the pure tension of trying to get back to youre dead body to grab youre stuff before one of the baddies picked it up was incredibly intense. And I was completely addicted to playing it back then. Until of course the massive influx of hackers and cheaters started infesting every single server and that was it I was done playing for good or so I thought.Cut to when they started to remake the game from scratch an incredibly bold move in my opinion. Gary stated that Rust was never actually meant to be a survival game at all I think it was some kind of a building program for another game they were working on and some how it just turned into Rust because people were having such a good time playing with it so it became its own game. Which is amazing to me that a game that wasnt even suposed to be a game was one of the best games I had ever played. So when they first came out with the experimental version I decided to give it a try. And I have to say I did not like it much at all and to top it off it ran really bad on the computer I had at the time. So again I vowed to never play it again.Then I think I saw some screenshots and saw a blog post showing some of the improvments to the game so I decided to give it one more chance and I'm happy I did. I think in part to the fact that now they are on the Unity engine and the fact that they are actually trying to make a survival game now has made this game like 10 times better then it was before which comepletely shocked me. And I mean honestly its like playing a completely new game and yes of course it is a new game but they did keep many of the same core mechanics just improved on every single aspect of this game. Like for instance they have completely revamed the building and crafting system (which was confusing at first until you get the basic concept then its easy peasy) which has made a HUGE difference to the game and improved it big time. Not to mention the countless things they have added now aka guns clothes an automated mining station &amp just too many things to name oh ya and forgot to mention ROCKET LAUNCHERS! And to me one of the very best parts is that Gary's team now patches and posts a blog weekly of the items they are working on and a list of the new items that they just added and new items that are a possibility to be added to the game. And I have to say that I am just blown away with this kind of game development. Where they keep you fully in the loop and they really do listen to the community and implement what us fans actually want. Like for instance and this is huge people a Rust game changer for certain. They are adding VEHICLES vehicles that you will be able to put together and configure yourself. Some people might say why add vehicles to this game and my answer is if you have run around these massive maps for litterally hundreds of hours I have to say it does get annoying not being able to have transportation of some sort. They added horses to the game (but currently are un rideable) so I assumed they would be rideable in the future. But then they came out with the vehicles and they do look like they will be pretty useful as you will be able to carry a bunch of rescources on them as well. But let me stress this to anyone interested in this game. Rust is still in Alpha and probably will be for some time. So who knows maybe vehicles wont even make it into the final build. But the point is they are willing to try and push the envelope and see what works and what doesnt. And that will ultimately be decided by what all of us the Rust community. Also regarding the hacker problems which will litterally drive me away from almost any game as I detest cheaters and get a real pleasure from seeing them get banned. Valve has now stepped in and has started banning people left and rigt which makes me as happy as a puppy. I'm sure there is still a hacker problem but it is much less then it used to be. And and this makes me really happy they are working on a server side no clipping tool which is why I always used to log on into my base with nothing broken into but all my chests empty from no clippers. I applaud Gary and his incredible developement team for doing something truly special with Rust. I mean lets be real honest here he could of just sitten back and collected the millions for the original version and laughed all the way to the bank and tbh I was conviced for a while that that is exactly what he was going to do. But I was so wrong and am so happy I was. If you think you migt like Rust but are unsure. I would suggest going to youtube and watching some videos on the game and make sure there recent videos and you might mistake the Legacy version of Rust for the current version which is the amzing one. Also if you are planning to buy the game spend a little time on youtube just to learn the basics of the game cuz once you get them down the game will become a whole lot more fun for you. Sorry this was my first review and if I was too long winded I appologise. But this is one of my favorite games of all time and I had to shed a little light as to why I thought that and still think that about this awesome game. Bottom line is Rust will go down as one of the best games I have ever played and let me tell you I have litterally played hundreds if not thousands of games. Rust 10/10,Rust

You kill a guy that has a revolver using the revolver you kill someone that has a semi automatic rifle using the rifle you kill someone with an Ak 47 and so on.Rust requires you to learn their physics their gun recoil. It will take a long time to master but when you are good at it it will reward you tenfolds.RaidingRust makes raiding very exciting and with alot of tension. Counter raiders is a big part of the raiding in rust Protecting your raid from nearby players is almost half the raid.TipsNever trust anyone.",Rust

2017-09-28,0,0,417,False,Recommended,Product received for free. Rust is a brutally difficult survival game set on a randomly generated island. This game slams you into the action right off the bat. Showing you your various meters and making you learn what is and isn't lethal the hard way. This is a very good thing. Games should not hold your hand.I know this game has a bad reputation with a lot of people and I understand this. But this game attracts a certain kind of person. It attracts one willing to dedicate time and effort into building up and surviving in the harsh climate one will find himself in. Many people are put off by this but I think everyone should try this game. The good Game looks fantastic. Wonderful gunplay Cool monuments. (In game locations) Amazing base building. Cool looking armors and weapons. Survival mechanics are wonderful. Resources are scarce making raids an appealing option.The bad The community. People KOS far too often and the general toxicity of the community can be off putting. Some guns are a tad overpowered. The AK is a bit ridiculous. The LR300 is useless. Decay. I understand the importance of decay but it is really annoying. And that concludes my review of Rust. I suggest you give it a shot!,Rust
2017-08-11,0,0,243,False,Not Recommended,rust is a great game beautiful graphics and fun building. i thoroughly enjoy playing the game itself. the reason i cannot recommend this game is because rust has one of the if not THE most toxic community i've ever been a part of. the game itself is wonderful but you can't play in a populated server without getting shot by some shmuck with an AK while you're naked with just a rock orlogging off after several hours of work just to log back in to find the same shmuck broke in and took all your stuff while you were offlinereally want to enjoy this game but there's no incentive for people to not be ravenous s so that's all that this game will ever be.,Rust

2018-06-10,0,0,735,False,Not Recommended,I have had some good times and I have had some bad times within the wonderful world of Rust it's extremely fun to play with friends but it is in the same way extremely ing frustrating because the game is geared towards the fat neckbeards who sit on their roof with a bolt action rifle 14 hours a day and only come down to kill nakeds on the beach. I cannot explain how many times I have gone so far on a roam and been on my way back to base then I just lose to people because they have better blueprints than me or a 15 man group.This game shouldn't require you to grind it all ing day in order to get anything accomplished but I also understand that it shouldn't be some spawn 2 minutes AK game I want a game where I can log in for a couple hours and actually get something done without just losing over and over again because people never log out I can check the server info every single day on US East Facepunch 2 and you will see the same fat sweaty s logged in for atleast 8 hours a day. It never ends with this ing game seriously. Not to mention the fact that when these people just overpower you due to sheer amounts of playtime or numbers they begin to talk don't get me wrong I love talking some but there is no point in talking when you have an unfair advantage because youre some lowlife piece of who lives in his mothers basement off ing welfare.,Rust

It's also constantly improving and i'm happy that i bought it. Besides the price which is pretty amazing.But there are also clear problems to keep in mind for this game.The biggest con are the servers! (I can't stress it enough!)...Laaaaaaaag....There are too many severs (imo should be only one with big player capacity and a bigger world). Now they are almost always full and lagged with a player capacity of only 200 and with a amazingly huge lag for the servers far from your location forcing you to play only with players near you. If they fix this server system i will come back to play.Also the worst kind of people in the universe gather here to play...Never saw in a game a community (if i can call them like that) so focused into keeping away new players.And of course the wipes. Every month a goddamn wipe that erases all your hard work!But... in general it's a very good game wich already can give you fun has lots of possibilities and for this price...worths the try!8/10,Rust

The learning curve in this game is huge even players with as much time as myself and beyond are still learning new strategies better base formats and overall how to deal with other players.All these guys with low hours writing bad reviews gave up after they made mistakes. This game is completely unforgiving the community isn't actually as bad as most people think the gameplay forces people to distrust each other. ing people over is goal #1 in this game. This isn't minecraft this isn't farmville this is RUST.Prepare to have your handed to you by a large group (because you were stupid enough to build near them. they don't want you taking the areas resources) prepare to suddenly find Jesus as you're loading in (hoping you haven't been raided) prepare to have your heart beat out of your chest during shootouts (you've got important resources on you) but mostly prepare to be killed by bears...( ing BEARS man...)Try to stay positive and be eager to learn.

2016-12-12,0,0,1331,False,Not Recommended,Rust at this point has just become a piece of stale dessert. It was the most delicious thing you tasted so much so that you wanted to save it so you kept it and slowly ate away at it. At some point however the food became stale. You taste it again only to find out that the texture and taste that it once had has vanished and been replaced by a taste of decay and a texture comparable to liver. You leave it but eventually your cravings get ahold of you again and being too lazy to go out to the supermarket you guiltily grip the addictive treat and give it another taste. You are surprised. Not because it is good or bad but has rather just lost all texture and taste it used to have. It is neither good nor bad it is just... decent.Anyone eating the treat in that state would perhaps recall it as delicious like you once did but for you you find it just dull and not at all comparable to the past of what the treat once was. You crave that taste it once had but as days pass by it just gets more and more mediocre more and more bland and textureless more and more boring until eventually the treat is completely textureless completely tastless and has a composition the likes of hardtack.You put the dessert down and after a while of reminiscing over how good it was you throw it in the trash.R.I.P.

I mean there are those rare chances you come across someone that doesnt kill you but if you've been playing rust for awhile you have a constant fear of everone so you can't really trust them so that team experience is ruined.

2014-07-10,0,0,48,True,Not Recommended,"Welcome to Rust the Bullying simulator. While rust in concept is a great idea where players can form alliances and defend their houses together while scrounging for supplies any established server where alliances have already been made makes it practically impossible to start in Rust. Expect to be shot in the face even if you don't have weapons the first few times you start the game until you can find a place to hide and when you do find a place to hide and build a base expect your base to be raided within the next few hours. Older established players will not let fresh players start on servers and will either shoot you while you are naked after you spawn or make you do some really weird stuff so that you can become their ""friend"". Playing rust is like hitting your head against a wall over and over again until you can't feel anything and you somehow delude yourself that not feeling anything is somehow good.",Rust

2013-12-28,0,0,1138,False,Not Recommended,"Sooo... Rust. Yeah what to say. As you can see I have a fair bit of hours on Rust. About 800 in the old Bear Chicken meat days. Where you could go into Rad Towns and actually find gear (not the best but good gear) instead of having to compete vs. every clan for an Airdrop. I met some of my best mates on this game. I'm generally at FPSs but I'm a strategic player. My mates were PVP gods. It all started when I gave a naked guy some food instead of killing the fresh spawn. We eventually even created our own server together so that we could play and since we were active we could get rid of all the hackers (Old RUST hacking was everywhere). Eventually we got so tired of dealing with all the hackers we shut down our server. And my main mate said ""Screw it if you can't beat em join em"" and started hacking on someone else's server (he was already really good at PVP didn't need hacks to kill hackers but meh). Anyway hackers killed old Rust even though the gameplay and style and people were overall better.Now to today. You have to survive spawn which is usually okay if you know what you're doing. But... spawning in the same goddamn 4 beach locations is annoying. Random Spawn should be Random like it used to be (well moreso than now). I shouldn't always have to try and run 30 mins and almost die 100000 times to get to a forest area where I can find food and make a small 1x1 just so I'm not in the ""spawn"" zone. Scraps WTF? Scraps is possibly the dumbest thing to be thought of in this game. Don't get me wrong I'm all for scraps to help me make something but scraps make this game near impossible for solos. The amount you have to grind and not die when trying to go to a recycler for a handful of scraps is just not logical. Get rid of the function of scraps that will help this game a lot. Allow actual Random Blueprint drops for ALL items based on location. If I go to Launch Site Red Card I should have the chance at an explosives or C4 Blueprint not the damn item. That being said make things rare again. Getting a bolty back in the day wasn't an easy task. Now you got fully kitted clans all with AKs within a few hours of a fresh wipe. Who is that fun for? And it's killing the game. When clans are too big that they take up half the server population you got a problem. Steer away from large team gameplay and start rewarded 1 4 squadplay.That being said not all is bad. I like the underwater aspects I like the boats I love the compound (because it's the only place you don't die while recycling and because a solo can skip a workbench level 1 and research table). I'm a decent fan of how you've improved some parts of crafting and how you've changed looting. I don't like the marks on the Trees/Ores though. That's gotta go. It puts you in a precarious situation and your gathering should be based off the gathering item not some buggy x marks the spot. Although I'm all about the smaller squadplay I do like the new team system. However I think it will affect skin sales. As well I think it should be reduced from max 8 to max 4. Jackhammer chainsaw and other similary are pretty cool too. You got some right but oh so much wrong. Focus on the Gameplay and interaction not the fancy features. Those of us that played with irradiated bears (and chickens) as our only chicken source didn't mind the weirdness and bugginess of it all. We just hated the hackers. Now you've got the hacker situation mostly taken care of focus back on the gameplay. I want to recommend you I really do. And I still play you. Oh and WTF? Why did you take DOWN SEA 1 FACEPUNCH and SEA 2 FACEPUNCH servers when they were the only (REALLY POPULATED) servers servicing those of us in SEA that want less than 100 ping?",Rust

2016-02-04,0,0,508,True,Not Recommended,If you don't like joining clans and just like playing solo or with a buddy do not get this game! This is as much of a co op game as i have ever seen. Guaranteed you will spend most of your time gathering stone and wood just to build and secure a small building which most likely will be raided wasting all the resources you've gathered. So like I said It's not a single player or small group friendly game at all. Big groups dominate servers by building near resource heavy areas guarding them and killing anyone that travels near. Supply drops that can give you a better chance for guns and attachments will always be taken by groups in which you'll never get. And at the end of the day you'll end up just begging for weapons and better building plans in chat. And all the while you are basically on a timer. Each server that runs this game wipes either weekly on large servers or near once a month on smaller servers. Completely wiping the server of structures built by players and often resetting player data meaning any crafting plans aka blueprints bp (weapons armor ect.) you may have found and memorized will be lost. Putting the game on a wipe timer means you are definitly going to either overplay this game or play extremely casually.I've played this game for 70 hours and honestly I felt like I acheived nothing at all in the end. Maybe a few laughs as it is fun the first few hours but it immediately turns into a farm fest really quick. At the end I basically was just hoping to log on and see my fort be raided so I could stop playing.,Rust
2018-07-16,0,0,106,False,Recommended,I love this game but the worst is optimization in rust.,Rust
2018-07-16,0,0,124,False,Not Recommended,Well it's decent. I can't stop playing it yet I hate it at the same time. There are 3 big things that make this game unlikeable.1.) Trying to play SoloYou really just can't. Facepunch seemed to have made the game so that if you have friends who can dedicate 3+ hours a day to a game to help you makes the game actually fun. However if you try to play by yourself it's near impossible. It takes too long to get anything done for everything you do you're on your own and if you up well you're out of luck.2.) Building MechanicsThey just need to scrap the current system and redo the entire thing. It's really bad. A lot of the walls and you need to place down often say that you can't place them even if theres nothing in the way. And if you change your mind about your base 5 minutes after you completed it whoops! You've now wasted your materials and will not get them back. And to add on to that you can't take them down. You'll have to swing 20 rocks at your wall for 15 minutes to get it down.3.) The MMO aspectI enjoy Rust for the survival aspect for the survival part not PvP. There really aren't many good survival game comparable to rust. You can try and find a no pop server but a group is bound to come on and unsettle the server. It would be nice if in a future update you could create your own small private servers for you and maybe some friends to enjoy the game on TL DR Solo is unplayable building is restricted playstyles. But the graphics are good.,Rust

2018-07-16,0,0,276,False,Recommended,One of the most frustrating and yet fun experiences in this game is when you have to build a base.Building a base in this game is like being a Buddhist monk working on his/her Zen garden. Moving the sand with extreme care and deep concentration. Each passing hour the Buddhist's level of Zen increases and achieve's true understanding of the universe. One would say he/she reaches Nirvana.As the monk gazes upon his/her creation marveling at its beauty a sense of pure satisfaction fills the spirit. Only to be rudely interrupted by raiders geared with C4 explosives Rocket launchers automatic rifles and a rock destroying the entire garden leaving you with nothing . If you are lucky you live long enough to fight a hopeless battle against them as you slowly die from starvation and or dehydration.This game is not for the faint of heart and I love it,Rust
2018-07-16,0,0,362,False,Recommended,This game is easy to learn while maintaining a level of difficulty The community servers are all garbage though sadly the only way to earn the achievements. The majority of the community servers are barely moderated and full of cancerous clowns running around killing everyone once they get an edge it's pretty much pointless. The game has a monthly forced wipe reset which sucks but it makes the game fresh again so it doesn't get too boring and renews the challenge. Modded servers make for a much more fun and enjoyable time if you find one that matches your style they are generally better moderated and have a very friendly playerbase. Assuming you can find one that is full of friendly players raiding can still happen but you should have a base to go home to afterwards.tl dr good game bad community servers some great modded servers some challenge is good preferably on sale cause I'm cheap,Rust

2015-07-17,0,0,722,False,Not Recommended,"Game that isn't really anything under the hood.If you truly want to see how much content a video game has especially a survival game play it with respect to PVE mode and not PVP.There is no single player mode on this game (though I suppose you could spin up your own server and play by yourself). The fact that this game has been developed over 4 5 years with NO story whatsoever other than ""You wake up as a naked on an island and... that's it"".Rust has to rely on PVP to make the game kinda worth playing. Problem is the PVP on this game is an absolute joke that requires as much dedication as an actual full time job (It's no surprise that I would guess most people who do play for the PVP content on here either are underemployed or unemployed). The reality is that I have my own committments in life so I can't be to spend so much time grinding with a HUGE PENALTY of loss as opposed to say Ark Worlds Adrift Minecraft Subnautica or any other popular survival game.Speaking of grinding the grind in this game is ing terrible and EXPLICITLY based around grouping up (or if you play solo/duels getting ass ed on sight because the community is toxic as hell). It's not uncommon for servers to be dead within 2 3 days on wipe (shoutout for weekly/biweekly wipes making the grind pointless for time investment). Of course people will say ""well you just need to gitgud"" and that's t because the game is so fundamentally BORING it needs offline raids to even have a sembelance of ""omg such fun"".I remember playing this before the blueprints were invented and the penalty of loss vs time invested was way less than what it was now. If you wanna play Rust go find a PVE server a Battlefield Server or a 1000x modded server. Vanilla is insufferable and broken at least modded communities have stepped up to the plate to correct Rust's wrongs that the Devs themselves can't seem to acknowledge.If you're out of school for the summer and have the socializing skills of a common 14 year old pimply faced this game is for you.

2014-02-22,0,0,23,True,Recommended,Absolutely recommend! Keep in mind it's still in alpha so it's going to be glitchy. It might even be glitchy to the point of being frustrating at time. But it's best to take it with a grain of salt and keep going!I don't have a gaming computer but even with a decent laptop it runs rather smoothly on good/medium graphic settings! There's a bit of a framerate jump here and there but thats mainly because of my laptop not the game's fault. A lot of people are complaining about the community but it's easy to find a PVE server. If you're a beginner and have no idea what to do in the beginning of the game GO TO A PVE SERVER! I have found some of the most kind and wonderful people on these servers and the only threat are the wolves and bears that wander about. In my opinion the crafting and building in this game is fantastic. Grinding for resources sometimes becomes a chore but seeing the fruits of your labor is worth it. I can't wait for future updates to see how the crafting continues to grow and improve. It's a great game and I highly recommend it to anyone. I haven't had a game spark an addiction in a long time but this game has managed to do so.,Rust

2014-01-28,0,0,1587,True,Recommended,Rating 8 10First off this is an alpha release keep that in mind the game is not complete but they do patch about once every week or so. This game is like an FPS in a few important ways. There are hackers however they are mostly on the official servers. Servers that are not in the official list are run by a person or set of people and they tend to take liberties with what they give or do for themselves. You are also in a first person perspective. That pretty much takes care of why this game is like an FPS and the admins +hackers are why I remove 2 points. When this game says survival there is something important you need to know. The survival in this game is against people! This game through and through is about PvPvP. Yes there are animals zombies radiation and hunger but these serve to carve out the world that the player interactions take place in. Interactions you say but I thought you said this was all about player killing player? No it is not all about killing and this is what makes rust amazing. I have had people help kill rob and backstab me. I have witnessed mob mentality take a group of 10 guys with rocks and turn them into murders knocking down shacks and murdering the inhabitants. The interactions in this game are truly awesome. Do I put my gun away? Risk of him getting the first shot vs him knowing I have a gun and wanting to kill me. Am I wearing armor? Does that say too much about what I have on me? Is he responding to me? Maybe he is not talking because he plans to kill me.All of those fragmented thoughts run through my head every time I meet someone. Understand another warning however. V is for using a mic if you don t have one most people will kill you before you can type a word in edge wise. This game is to high risk for typing to be anything other than a novelty or way to talk to everyone across the map. Another Warning personal space is big. Get too close and you might get shot. Let them come close and you will find yourself getting shot/stabbed. Keep a good 10 15 foot personal space barrier. Demand people put their weapon down. 100 s of hours of playing teaches you these things that you might not think of when you re in the moment for the first time with 60 wood 30 metal ore and a hatchet or something else nice. If you keep a good distance you can also get away with not having a gun or weapon out as a press of 1 6 could bring your shotgun out to deal with an over eager kid treading in your personal bubble.Overall I love this game and foresee many more an hour spent enjoying never knowing if this guy is going to work with me to get resources or murder me for them...Or perhaps I will murder him..?...,Rust

2018-04-20,0,0,1859,False,Not Recommended,at one point in early 2017 this game was amazing I sunk 1000 hours in to it playing everyday. As I finished discovering most aspects about the game it lost all entertainment to me and I stopped playing it as the updates were not to my liking.I did have fun playing it and it was well worth the purchase however it's now 35$ and in my opinion is not as good as when components were first introduced.I would give it a positive if I were in 2017 writing this review but rust has lost its charm.it was a 10/10 game for mebut now I would only give it 6/10 so im going to give it a negative review,Rust

I have a Mac and all it did when i first got it was crash constantly I kept trying and trying until i finally got it to load afterwards.

2015-04-21,0,0,952,True,Recommended,"Now This isnt gunna be no IGN review but I reccomend you check this one out as I have had alot of time with this game Ive played around 600 hours on both Legacy and ""New Rust"" and I think its safe to say (with a couple of other Open world survival games) That Rust is the best Hands Down.Pros + PvP is Good Fun and Intresting.+ Building is good allowing players to make unique bases.+ Fun is general always have you on something.+ Solo can be just as destructive as a group of 4 players.+ Raids are Good fun Solo or grouped.+ Updated frequently Inbetweens The community is alright ( Ik alot of people will hate on me for saying this but not all people kos in my experience)Cons Can be hard to run if your PC isnt as ""high end"" you cant run this with a potato. Hackers (Its hard to run into these guys but most big servers have one in the biggest clan you can kill them) Even with a ""high end"" PC you can still experience lag in gunfights (sometimes proving fatal) On big servers like Rustopia and Offiical servers if you dont have a group it can be impossible to build up ( Thankfully you can go to community servers and type in solo in the search bar for a servers with groups only as big as three people) End game gives you nothing but raids helis and airdrops to do which is still fun but I wish there was more.Overall I recommend this game to you as it is really fun and can be a even better game as they update it so frequently Personal Rate 9.5/10",Rust
2015-11-06,0,0,7,True,Not Recommended,The video on the store page looks like a great game. I couldn't wait to play it once I downloaded it. Unfortunately for me at least this game only serves as a tool of frustration. I love the premise and perhaps could enjoy the game if I could actually survive long enough to build even the simplest of tools before being killed by the veterans of the game. While it's true I only have a little over 6 hours of play time record survival time being just under 6 minutes on official servers it ends up feeling like the time I put in is forever. Usually I'll get killed running naked with a rock and torch a couple times move on to a different game try again with same results and then uninstall for a few weeks.Perhaps I wouldn't regret this purchase so much if noobs (me at least) had some chance to get into the game before feeling nothing but frustration and defeat.I will keep trying to get somewhere in this one with hopes of maybe getting a chance / break perhaps then I will at least get my money's worth of enjoyment.,Rust

You better be masochistic you'll die no matter how well armored you are no matter where you hide no matter how well you build your house. Use blueprints immediately when you find them that way you can build it after you're killed in a few minutes. Doesn't matter if your non aggressive they'll kill you on sight for the fun of it. Just spawned? Target practice. Finally built a house? Free resource stash.Try to have fun in this game you might have better luck than I.,Rust

2016-07-29,0,0,261,True,Recommended,I had originally given this game a negative review when the devs replaced the old blueprint system with an experience system that was both grindy repetitive and made everyone want to kill themselves out of boredom. Now that it is out for good and replaced with a component based system where you actually have to look for the parts to build weapons and armor I can finally give Rust the positive review it deserves. Keep in mind when you first start playing you will have a tough time with a steep learning curve. That's ok though since we've all been there. Eventually through trial and error you will hearn how to build and fight effectively enough to come out on top.Always make sure you come out on top. Other players will not even hesitate to wipe you off the map and KoS so don't cry on the forums when you yelled friendly at someone and they mowed you down anyways. Always make sure you're armed too.Weapons in this game are pretty good but recoil can be pretty tricky to control. Aiming a bow in the game is very similar to how you'd aim one in real life. The devs went through a lot of details on the guns too. There are even ricochet sounds when you shoot a rock small sonic cracks when they zoom by you and they even whizz through the air if one goes by you.Overall I highly recommend Rust.,Rust

2016-06-15,0,0,159,False,Recommended,"Where to start??? Ok so first off the Rust community is one the best and worst communities out there. One minute you will be walking threw the forest minding your own business as a naked man/women just trying to survive in this post apocalypse world. When all of a sudden a fully gear man come running through the leaves. As you yell ""friendly..."" this man comes up to and hits you in the head with a rock. As you lay helpless on the ground begging for you life the man begins to bring up to your feet. Once upon your feet the man gives you some reascources to get started and then you are on your way. As you continue your journey through the wastland not five minutes after meeting that friendly face you run into him again. Instead of letting you go like he did not to long ago he put one bullet in your head and yells ""F**king P****"" and your are off to square one.Besides this Semi toxic community this game is very enjoyable. There are hours and hours of fun to be had in this even with or without friends. if you are on the border of buying this game. Then I recommend buying this game during a sale of some sort. I've been playing Rust sinse it had came out in 2013. While this game has its ups and downs. sinse its full released i have enjoyed the hours that i had put into it.Now I will go over some Pros and Cons that I had came up with.Pros You can have Hours of fun! Base buliding is quite good and very pleasing as you build to see your home come to life. There are plenty of different servers to fit the type of play style that you choose. You don't need to be a pro FPS player to play this game basically anyone with a mouse and keyboard can play this game. The graphics quality are pretty good even on medium to high settings.Cons Game tend to lag quite often (at least in my case). Player tend to K.O.S (kill on site) alot but thats to be expected. BUGS... While just like any other game is has its bugs and glitches. Does tend to crash more often then you would expect even when trying to close the game.I hope this Review has helped somewhat in your effort in deciding wether or not to buy this game.",Rust

I find it to be a full time job and hard to play with a full schedule and I wish there were different modes in the game with EZ modes giving more scrap and other things. Some might say go play moded but then u deal with pay to win kits and bad performance.2. I love the new stuff coming into rust and keeps it fun but I would like to see more work on performance. I do not know the first thing when it comes to these things with optimization but I fell it could be worked on a little more.3. I know everyone has there own opinion on where they want rust to go but I think this concept will work out for everyone 1. make 2 3 game modes and/or add a tutorial for new players. (even add zoms if wanted) 2. add it so that when u research something that u can craft it anywhere (this does not need to apply for every item e.g. rockets etc.) but when u have a workbench u a lot of the items but guns and other items may not be added (This can go into the diff. the number of items u have. 4. MAKE MORE OF THE STUPIDEST THINGS DEFAULT AND GET THE OTHER ISH OUT OUT BARRELS AND MAKE MORE SUFF DEFALT.

2014-02-27,0,0,29,True,Not Recommended,At first it's pretty fun to strike out and attempt to build something while hiding from players and animals alike. However once you begin encountering more players a lot of that excitement is lost because the outcome is completely predictable. You will be shot at on sight with zero justification or verbal communication no matter how how much gear you appear to have. Once the illusion of multiple forms of player interaction is gone the game just plays as a poor first person shooter with MMO type gathering grind. It's understood that Rust is a harsh game but the playerbase has reduced what was a refreshing open world concept into a large deathmatch lobby.,Rust

2018-02-17,0,0,476,False,Not Recommended,Game used to be a gem but now as of August 2018 it lost all its charm. It went from a fun and hardcore social/PvP survival game to every server being filled with 20+ player clans stomping on everyone in their way. Its pathetic for us solo/small groups because our progression will never be as great as a clans. Facepunch and Helk needs to stop catering to these huge clans and give more incentive to play as a solo or small team rather than clanning out. On top of that the game runs like now. I used to get like 150 FPS with nice settings but now I only get around 90 100 FPS all LOW settings. Game really just turned to once Helk took development from Garry.,Rust

2015-10-12,0,0,2,True,Not Recommended,I wanted this game really badly when I first heard of it. It was on my wishlist for 2 years until a friend of mine gave me a copy from a 4 pack. It was a dream come true the game at the top of my wishlist was finally in my library! Start up and installation were smooth but the whole thing fell on its the moment I joined a server. The whole ing thing crashed after freezing for a full 15 seconds staring at the dirt and I restarted (and crashed) twice before deciding to lower the graphics to Low. I proceed to rejoin the same server only to get slapped in the face with a pathetic 10 fps. All the excitement was replaced with frustration now and I proceed to lower the graphics to the equivalent of a stale potato. 640x480 windowed mode and everything set to absolute trash.Joined a different server with said potato graphics and get slapped with a horrible 30 fps. Tried to get something done with the measly fps only to lag so hard while walking that I crashed straight into spikes and died. Respawned tried to chase a horse with an axe only to for it to literally run through a mountain and vanish. That more or less killed the mood and I just quit.Honestly this needs to get optimized a lot. Hopefully when it gets out of Alpha the frame rates will improve and less... frustrating incidents will occur. Bugs are also all over the place although its understandable in Alpha. Unless they optimize this crap or you have a powerful computer I'd recommend playing Unturned or something.,Rust

People complain about kos but if they get the chance will stab you in the back as a naked. large groups are a probelm for small groups but they are disorganized. all and all what it comes down to is if you are persisitent and confident you will have sucess also some wipes you get luck sometimes you get a good start all mattersNO MATTER WHAT HIT THAT RESPAWN BUTTON AND MAKE THEM PLAYS,Rust

Now there are things I HATE about the game like the community but besides that the game is so much fun to play once you figure things out. I recommend playing on a more dead server when you first start so that when you join a very ""populated"" server you will know your basics and what to do. This game does take time to fortify your base if you go on vanilla servers. if you go on the modded its a lot easier but also more fun! ) I also recommend playing with friends because its a lot easier gathering resources but solo is a lot of fun too.Edit There are a lot of hackers in this game now its not fun anymoreEdit #2 changing to recommended. game has developed better.",Rust

Even the official website says ""RUST has been available in Early Access on Steam since late 2013. During this time it has sold over 5 million copies worldwide."" That tells you all you need to know about this game. The devs only care about the money. The more people they can trick into buying this neverending always changing box the better. Let me know when they decide to finally finish the game and/or they allow me to just chill and build stuff on my own server or offline. Then maybe I'll come back.**UPDATE**I still wish they had a single player mode and I still haven't played it again.

2018-08-03,0,0,165,False,Recommended,multiplayer pvp sucks unless you're in a clan with 5+ people but there are some fun PvE servers. I like that the developers haven't abandoned this game like many of the survival games of the time. Base building is fun although gathering resources is a bit tedious. A wide vareity of modded servers allow you to find what best suits your style of play.,Rust

2018-04-14,0,0,732,False,Recommended,NEUTRAL since there is no option its a good game but the constant farm for scrap and materials for upkeep is hard if you want to play solo your better off playing a modded server if u play duos u may have a chance on normal facepuch servers the only way YOU CAN SURVIVE on normal servers is if u have a squad the servers. to be honest the game is not worth 27 BGP the game is fun i cant deny that but the grind is to much i miss the old rust getting wood stone and metal building a base then making a pistol to work your way up the whole scrap system is a good idea just the way it was put in was not done well.

If you like PvP gather your group gear up with Assualt Rifles and explosives and go raid other players bases for their precious loot. On the other hand if you don't like PvP you can Build Huge bases and compounds Hunt a variety of wildlife Farm Pumpkins and Corn (More crops coming soon) Engineer machines to collect ores and oil and explore the map. The Devs at Facepunch are very active and responsive to the community by updating the game every friday and releasing their DevBlogs on playrust.com.

But the game is great and it is really fun if you just have a great computer and have about thouse 60 ping caus then its fun and with a frined or two its even better.

2018-08-05,0,0,965,False,Not Recommended,At no point of my rust career have i felt that my 20 dollars have been well spent. Helk is making this once somewhat enjoyable game into a show with unnecessary updates and adjustments. Much of the game consists of farming up and then losing it all immediately afterwards. There are highs and many more lows and as we all know lows feel a lot worse than highs feel good. Much of the game is pitch black and consists of you sitting in your base waiting for time to pass so you can actually do something productive in the morning. This game is going downhill and will only lead you to anger and frustration at devs.,Rust

2017-02-09,0,0,259,True,Recommended,Rust Oh Rust.Rust is a great game the resourse gavering the base building the base defense it's all fun with one big fat caveat... providing the absolutely savage and toxic as hell community allows you to get started.To me that is where this game falls apart. The community. The general Rust experience is that you spawn up and get massacared either by heavily geared players that roof camp or by a posse of naked people who are frustrated and so go on their own killing rampage.You can 'mostly' avoid some of it by joining a sever that has just been wiped. If you and your team work hard enough you can get something established and start being able to hold your own at this point the game does become great fun.It'd been a while since I last played Rust and back then it ran like poo but that isn't the case anymore it's significantly more optimised than it used to be so it runs great and looks great.Overall I recommend Rust with my only other gripe being that it's not very challenging (yes yes I know the players pose a challenge in themselves) but the core game doesn't really challenge the player enough survival is too easy.,Rust
2017-02-09,0,0,642,True,Not Recommended,I wish I could recomend this game. I actually love this game and wasted many hours on it. This game is all about surviving making a base getting your base broken into being killed and robbed and doing the same to others. While that sounds awful that is actually the fun of it. The problem is the unreliability of the servers. Having fun playing on a certain server? Well too bad it goes down randomly for a day. What about the server you joined that said it would wipe a month later? Well after way too many hours working on your base the mods decide to change their rules to 'we wipe monthly or if there are not enough players' destroying all your hours of work in an instant because they randomly changed their mind. Getting past the fact that everyone is out to kill you and take all your stuff is easy. Dealing with the uncertainty of the servers makes this game frustratingly unplayable. All in all a waste of my $20 and way too much time.,Rust

Not a game if you have an hour to blow takes time to make progress. You will neglect you're spouse/family in your freetime and well worth it #rustlife.3 Things I Like 1 The PvP portion is nice because youre always watching your back.2 Amount of freedom in constructing your house.3 It's just so much fun a lot of fun.3 Things I don't like 1 When you get a map and discover some parts its only on that map. If someone loots you its gone. I'd like to have a map feature that stays with your guy.2 Better building on slightly uneven surfaces.3 Faster initial loading when you log on.,Rust
2015-10-10,0,0,193,True,Recommended,The game is fun but so hard to get started when you are new. If you like restarting over and over join a heavily populated server. If not try a lower populated one or start with PVE. Though PVE gets boring very quickly as there are no real threats. The bears and wolves are easy to manage.Overall it is enjoyable. Just be careful of other players. ),Rust

2018-08-07,0,0,1617,False,Recommended,lOT OF Salt in this game. Lot of racist kids playing as well. Most cant take it when you kick their butts. Game is more PvP/Raiding oriented than survival and is still being worked on. Overall I will recommend it even though their ban hammer pilicies are flawed. Seen some people that I know wasnt hacking get banned while some that were blatantly hacking still playing to this day. They dont even let you appeal the bans whiich is BS as well. This is also a group Oriented game solo players will struggle unless on a community server with an active adimin that limits player group sizes although dang near every one of these servers have admins that help their friends which creates an unfair field. I would love to see the survival part fleshed out a bit more and a little more balance with the in game weather but whtas thwir works for now.,Rust
2018-08-07,0,0,72,False,Recommended,I bought this game back in EARLY alpha when there was only one kind of meat in the game and the best weapon you could get was a bow and arrow. They have changed ALOT i recently came back to playing it and it honestly feels like an entirely different game altogether.I personally find it to be fun though ive only played with a handful of friends. For those of you who like to host your own dedicated servers this isnt the easiest but also isnt the hardest to host. There is also a wonderful program called RSM Rust Server Manager that has been developed to stream line setup and configuration aswell as find and install plugins to the server (if you want a modded one).Im fairly certain the raiding and PvP aspects are what draw alot of attention to this game however i personally like it because i can run it almost like a sandbox the maps are pretty large and are fun to explore and the building and upgrading mechanics are also pretty fun to mess around with.All in all id have to say this is a pretty good game enough so that i am willing to recommend though it isnt one of my top 10 (atleast not YET) Having seen the changes that have been made i anxiously await what comes next and hope the dev's will continue making and adding new content! &lt 3,Rust

2015-03-10,0,0,2242,True,Recommended,Hello Interms of this game being an Alpha it is absolutely a game to consider spending your money with!Not only does this game open a new style of gaming which is sooo addictive but also great moments that follow throughout gameplay.Currently with a hour count of 1.2k the only real downfall for this game is the currupt community using hacks.If you find the right server you can avoid this situation.Overall I believe for a game in such early stages as 'Alpha' has such big potential and is definitely worth your $19.99.Regards Ne Adito Oppeto,Rust

2018-08-08,0,0,9,False,Recommended,I learned very quickly that this game is not for the light hearted you've got to be able to take hits and not get mad 1st time playing I think I got lucky I died about 20 30 times but I met some kind people like a lot of kind people. When I had finally gotten the concept of building I went to build a house beside a river which I was approached many times and I either hid or faught. One day a korean man started building next door so I went over to say hi he freaked out at first but I reassured him as best I could without speaking his language that I was friendly. He ended up dying and quitting the game after I was being raided by 2 guys with guns and he tried to help me out. I ended up waiting the raid out and they gave up and by then I had to go so I gave my sleeping bag spawn to a guy who didnt have a base yet and left the game. Honestly the most fustrating but best experience I've ever had in a game highly recommend. (you may be killed a lot but give it a chance),Rust

2014-02-01,0,0,8,True,Not Recommended,After a lot of looking around I bought this game. It's really reaaaaally early access. Having said that for an early access game it's actually really good. But (before you have to read everything here) I don't recommended you buy it YET.Don't expect a story any help from the game any objectives. If I sum up what the game is about now You start on a huge island (map is impressive) and have to survive with nothing but a rock. You can interact with stuff to get more stuff. You need to eat keep warm and DON'T DIE! There are zombies but only a couple. You have to have wood and stone to make a hatchet to kill animals (the rock is too slow p) to get food and cloth and more stuff. You can build huts beds fires all those things. It is actually quite fun to do for a couple of hours.There's a lot of negative reviews about people getting killed by others constantly. I didn't have a problem with that (I managed to die on my own quite a bit tyvm p). What I did have problems with is the interface (or lack there off). No help there and it depends on the server if you can /help /who etc.TIP if you do decide to get this 'game' pick a good server!! Look for newb friendly no deterioration (unless you want to built your hut back up everytime you dont play for a couple days) instant craft (or half craft &lt that's about craft times). For now I don't think the price is worth it and well it's just not done enough for me. After a couple hours I was kind of done with it. 4/10. Not recommended at the moment. Might shape up nicely. Just keep an eye on it.,Rust
2014-02-01,0,0,19,True,Recommended,You must always play this game with freinds and if you dont run away from everything and especially everone till you find a place that is isolated with good harvest spot then build.So put it in a way you can understand dont play by yourself and if you do pick a server with a few people.

I think it might be because at this pace of updates you will have to wait like 5 years to get playable game. I give it a thumb up ONLY because of the concept survival+crafting+sandbox. Unfortunately the physics is poor graphics is just fine animations poor performance poor. What I don't like also is hackers who intrude your game and a lot of unnatural half finished buildings left by players it just looks garbage.

I know its a * &amp ! alpha.. this doesnt mean you have to disable stuff that does not work it means you have to FIX IT! crossfire always had issues with rust even in legacy.. i could work around it with my (driver) settings.I somewhat understand them DEFAULTING to the borderless window.. but hell give people that are willing to put the effort in to make crossfire profiles (and sending them to amd) the option to do so else there will never be optimisation for your game.DO NOT BUY i guess the dev team is adding more and more stuff in a broken game... thats like installing an audio system in a car with NO WHEELS OR ENGINE,Rust

2017-01-18,0,0,1644,True,Recommended,The component system gets a lot of hate but compared to the BluePrint and XP systems it is much much better! No longer do you need to spend days/weeks/months to learn recipies that other players already know... meaning you don't have to run around with a bow while people with AK's chase you. You can litterally craft everything good job Facepunch!!I played legacy and yeah it was great... the rebuild in Unity took a long time and I can honestly say the game is now BETTER than it was in legacy. They have made Rust Great Again! People tend to forget how many hackers there was in legacy people flying up to your lootroom and C4ing in headshot hacks and more! Those are problems that could not be solved on the legacy engine.No other survival game I have played has been able to create the suspense passion and excitement as Rust does and this of course creates a ton of salt when you lose but hey it's a game!! People who complain about people who kill on sight will eventually learn that it is the only way to survive in Rust. I personally shoot nakeds in the body to see if they have hidden guns then help them up and heal them up. You can really play this game any way you like.So yeah if you are looking for a really good steep learning curve hard core survival game and you have fire in your heart GET THIS GAME!!,Rust

2017-10-26,0,0,6035,False,Not Recommended,So this is my second review for this game. My first review was positive but since then the developers have changed Rust a lot for the worse.Rust used to be a really fun game to play with your friends. You used to be able to get on as often as you wanted to and casually play. However Rust has become extremely grindy. You have to put a lot of hours in to get anywhere. You also have to play in a group or you wont be able to compete on vanilla servers with groups. Of course there should always be a perk to being in a group but the recent changes to this game has been geared towards helping groups and screwing over solo players. This game is just not fun anymore. You grind and grind for nothing. It really sucks leaving a negative review for my favorite game but it's just not there anymore. I shouldn't even call it a game anymore because it's more of a job. I was also a base builder on YouTube for Rust but the developers have ruined base building as well. I have recently uninstalled this game and I would not recommend buying it until they fix this issue they have caused.,Rust

2018-05-10,0,0,149,False,Recommended,Wow. I recommend Rust for all people because of how awesome this game is. You can build if your not interested in shooting other players you can trap people in your base and wait them out or kill them. You can be a salty that runs around killing people and screaming into the mic. You can run around get someone wounded taunt them and then get headshoted. Or you can actually play the game where you start from scratch get your own recorces build a base and raid other people. The choice is yours because in Rust literally anything is possible. You might even think I ll make a YouTube series out of this game! Well that. With 300 hrs on the game your still going to suck at everything. So just play until you ve got at least 1 500 hrs on it to be good because Rust is not easy. And besides who wants to watch a video of a 30 year old man dying over and over again by toxic kids who s moms don t let them play Rust but they play it anyway. In Rust you can even just join high loot servers get recorces make a raid base and then raid other people for fun. Have fun playing a complicated but amazing game.,Rust

2018-01-27,0,0,374,False,Recommended,Rust is the best survival game out there but does that mean survival games are still worth playing?Lets talk about what Rust does right Pros Visuals The game looks good and runs nicely the sun cutting through trees at dawn looks especially nice Freedom Provided you can survive this game allows you to build fight and overall just play how you want (Most) Weapons Most weapons are fun to use whether during a last ditch holdout or on a manhunt The little things Paintings decorations cosmetics farming modded servers these are small things that add to the overall experience of rust Monuments The locations within the island look cool and are fun to adventure into Updates the devteam at Facepunch may not make all the right choices but it is evident that they care about rust and the game is steadily updated every month with new features/items/areasCons Balance This game is extremely frustrating with how the balance between resources and players takes place. Geared players while powerful used to be able to be killed through thought out and skilled ambushes now they are able to dominate servers. The grind oh my ing gawwwwwwwwwwwwwdddddddddddddddddddddddddddd.... The stupid as hell scrap system they use now is so ing stupid. Playing on vanilla feels like pulling teeth. Unlocking things isnt fun or interesting it's literally smacking a barrel to get 1 scrap at a time towawrds a 250 scrap unlock. (at least you can recycle components but even still its painfully slow. Facepunch why they hell do you keep adding guns? We don't need guns we have every type of gun and then some why not add more primitive weapons and bring back the effective low tier weapons? Not saying ak's should be beaten by a rock but at the same time its not fun for nakeds to be running into day one ak's which control the server. This is why your servers die in a day facepunch buff primitive weapons or else servers will keep dying out Clans There is no downside to a clan it doesnt cost scrap to make anything which makes clans insanely powerful. You will either have to play in one or lose 3 days of progress.SummaryOverall the content of Rust is pretty good just the execution of how it is implementing is frustrating to no end. Don't get attached to your base unless you live in a 15+ man clan.,Rust
2018-07-12,0,0,1405,False,Recommended,This is a great game filled with the thrill of losing all of your gear and also gaining tons. This game has a lot to offer and so many experiences to be made.

2018-05-20,0,0,827,False,Recommended,Its a fun game overall.Ive played Rust for 3 years already and enjoyed the majority of patches.I like how the key lock is now a viable early game tactic for solo players not having to worry about losing your key and therefore your base as well. Butttttt... scientists being added into the game has made stalking and farming a problem. Double headshots insta death from a phyton wielding scientist does my head in literally.Scientists should just stay in rad towns tbh that would be the best option in my opinion.Love the new features with boats and diving kits being able to create new base designs every wipe is awesome and makes the game so much more refreshing and interesting.so cheers for a great game that i can gladly waste a load of time on.Ohh and fix your crafting times i hate having to waste 10 minutes sitting in base creating gunpowder beancans satchels.,Rust

You will love it at first you will spend days gathering resources building your house and having a good time then 6 people who have been playing for a year and have 10 times better equipment than you will destroy your house all your resources and kill you. You will have to start over. The first time it might even seem kind of cool you'll load back up and try again after 5 or 6 times and 10+ hours wasted with nothing to show for it you will stop playing and feel jipped out of your 20 bucks. Oh and to top it all off even if you manage to get to where you can defend yourself the raiders will just wait until you log out and take everything and kill you while you can't defend yourself.

2018-08-22,0,0,869,False,Recommended,Love the game. I've had it for a month. Extremely addictive. The survival aspect is real. The adrenaline is unlike any game I've played before. There is a grind. You can loose everything. But when you make a play or find some loot or raid a base you will always be wanting to come back for more... Too addivtive haha,Rust
2018-08-23,0,0,36,False,Recommended,I LOVE THIS GAME AND HATE IT AT THE SAME TIME! Lemme explain. So whenever you join a server the first part where you should gather recourses for you to build stuff will be the hardest. Everyone will be trying to kill and even after you ve built your house it s gonna get raided so good luck with that. In the other place I love this game for the intensity and action and it s really cool to gather around with friends and raid people.,Rust

2016-01-03,0,0,1499,True,Recommended,It's a fun game of survival if you log the hours to learn it properly. At first you will start out roaming around trying to survive the wilderness hunt food collect resources ect. all while trying to avoid as many players as possible for you don't know if they're friendly or not. Most are not but soon you will learn to how build a base a home sweet home. Somewhere to put all of your items that you have collected put up signs make it yours then when you log off someone will bust in your improperly placed front door ransack the place take everything you have kill you and lock you out of your own house. Then you repeat the process untill you either build a great unraidable base or join a clan. This is not a game for solo players so you will have to meet people which is the most pulse pounding experience of your gaming life because it's almost like an old west standoff if they pull a gun you will have to react fast to take them down and run home with their stuff. Overall the game is great if you're the worst possible human alive murdering stealing burglarizing homes shooting at anyhting living on the beach and pretending to be a fresh spawn just to kill a couple of people an hour in the game to get guns and resources for free.,Rust

2014-06-17,0,0,167,True,Not Recommended,Hard Starts. As per usual if you think about it this game is pretty good. Problem is where ever you go there is always someone who is better prepared than you are. And for that they added Server Resets. Problem with those is that even though the guys in big metal bases are put on the same levels as the rockers people who just drive their feet into the ground are shoved back as well.,Rust

2017-03-12,0,0,135,True,Recommended,Where do I begin this game has been in alpha for longer than I had steam. In reality though it is still in alpha because it still needs more work.ProsIt is an incredibly good game to play as a multiplayer survival and sandbox however it does have limits with what can be created at the moment.Playing it as a first person shooter can also be good as the physics are well made for shooting and bullet drop.ConsIt's a time dump you invest a heck of a lot of time into something that is worthless something that you could lose the moment you get raided.The servers are usually massive with a lot of players each is basically a shoot first ask questions later meaning the moment you see something move you shoot it however this problem is with the players not the game so to solve it the servers reset a lot to give new players a chance.Essentially if you have time to waste get this game but if you like doing something meaningful or useful don't get it.,Rust

I really like the aspect of survival in terms of defending your base from other players. If you are a new player I recommend you start watching shed loads of youtube videos in order to educate yourself before you actually spend long hours playing the game. This will help you make your time worth more. There is various streamers you could watch to improve various skills (building pvp raiding .. etc) for example my favourite ones are ShackyHD and Trausi.Good Luck!

2014-02-05,0,0,180,True,Recommended,This game is great if you're friendly and have a larger group of friends to play with and protect each other or if you're one of those people that like to harass people for no reason. If you're a single person trying to be friendly and/or do your own thing then good ing luck.Anyone solo trying to mind their own business in this game is easy prey for the wanna be bandits who think gunning down someone with a rock is fun stuff.I was unfortunate enough to get my base raided while I and 3 other people were still online and inside it. We were playing friendly offering what we could to people that needed help I don't believe any of us had killed a living player yet. Some of us were having issues occasionally being KOS but it was never too much of an issue until someone actually came into our base. The worst part of it all was the fact that the guy raiding our base had actually apologized for killing me earlier and gave me wood and a pistol not even an hour before my base got raided. We ended up being heavily out gunned so finally I as well as another one of our base mates locked ourselves in our portions of the base and destroyed our supplies so the raiders couldn't get to them. When we finally managed to come outside after they left we noticed thwy hadn't even taken much if any of the stuff we left in the crates not locked up. It was almost as if they came in our base and gunned us down because they could.The scavenging and survival aspects of the game are fun it's the players that find enjoyment out of griefing people that make the game hard to play. I would not recommend this game to anyone who can't play with other friends unless they were cool with having to start over all the time even in friendly servers being gunned down repeatedly and being raided is an issue. After 48 hours of play in less than 3 days I'm still no better off than I was when I started.,Rust

2017-01-16,0,0,231,True,Recommended,Love the idea of this game love playing it and love it...when it actually runs right. I have an X51 and this game runs like absolute garbage half the time. I run it on the lowest settings and I can't even walk sometimes. It's pathetic. That being said sometimes it runs fine at mid graphics but a lot of the time absolutely terrible. It's incredibly frustrating when you have to deal with all the the game is designed to throw at you only to find out that radiation starvation bandits and helicopters are no match for lagging and frame rate drops.,Rust

2017-01-16,0,0,35,True,Recommended,Great game 9/10 there are a few bugs still in the game but they rule out after the quality of the graphics and the amazing gameplay you can achieve in Rust...

2017-01-01,0,0,144,True,Recommended,Awesome game! Very real. Even losing everything you worked days for has a unique excitement. Every action has a permament and final reaction. But at least you can come back from the dead and take your revenge another day. Just don't take it too seriously. This game can seriously give you a heart attack.And don't let the complaints of a toxic cancerous community turn you off. Those players should go play solitaire. Rust is about gaining advantage anyway you can. Everyone is struggling to survive.I liked everyone I met on Rust even the gang that raided my little newbie solo base. After they killed me they gave me some advice on base building and even gave me my key back.Another time a door squatter replaced my sleeping bag in my base after shooting me in the head.It's all about perspective. Have fun and don't take it so d*mn seriously.,Rust

2014-03-13,0,0,23,True,Recommended,I purchased Rust as an impluse buy. You begin with nothing... a rock an empty wasteland and the sunlight slipping below the distant horizon into an eerie orange glow.18 hours 998 deaths and 999 lives later i stand in my ramshackle house with my handmade shotgun pointing towards my front door. There are three bandits outside. I can hear them talk to each other discussing how they will split the loot. This game can be rewarding and distressing. You get out what you put in. You can lose everything in a heartbeat.I will say that the performance can get choppy in the center of the map. Hopefully this will be resolved as the game progesses past Alpha and Beta.,Rust

2014-03-13,0,0,247,True,Recommended,I do recommend this game. It is only in Alpha... but sweet sugar is it cool! This game has like beast potential after Alpha.... This game is sick.

I highly recommend this game and you can find out more why I do because there's a lot more to this game than just the things I listed. Buy it is really all I need to say.Game Rating 20/10,Rust

2014-02-07,0,0,5,True,Recommended,Honestly ive seen a lot of videos on this game and was psyched when i bought it i meet the minimum requirements which is usually more than enough but Foliage and other types of Graphical Textures slow me to a crawl and its annoying that there are no advanced options such as turning off foliage like the grass or lowering textures anti aliasing MSAA tweaks and other things that can optimize to some peoples computers i think that in one of these next few updates we should be able to tweak these settings! i REALLY want to play this game and it upsets me that i cant because all i can do is enable V Sync and turn the Rendering Quality down all the way and this STILL does not help. even Resolution Changes dont work. If i were to Rate this game out of 10 i would say a 5 Mostly because ive had virtually no gameplay due to the graphical errors. I only give a 5 because of the things ive seen about it.,Rust

2017-03-05,0,0,2206,False,Recommended,Rust to me right now is an amazing game with the absolutely worst community ive ever seen in a game. people in the community will have you believe the game is nothing but an absolute show 24/7 when in reality its nowhere near as bad as theyd have you believe. As im writing this review i am coming up on 2k hours and there have been times where i wanted to delete the game and times where i wanted to do nothing but grind and play for days on end. Rust is a rollercoaster of events and emotions you could have an amazing time for 1 week and do nothing but destroy anyone and anything that comes across your path and then the next week be barely able to get anything done and lose everything within the first few days of wipe. The devs are constantly working on the game and realease new content to the main branch every first thursday of the month. Yes there are some things that id like them to fix or reinstate such as the old building system instead of what we have now because now i feel as though the current building system does not reward people who are more building oriented than pvp. i feel that the pvp itself needs reworking a thing id like to see is if you have no head armor if you get headshot with a bow or above you should die immediately instead of being able to get headshot and keep running. because depending on your health and distance ive seen nakeds tank SAR shots and AK shots to the head and keep going. but my main point to the game is that ive never been bored playing it. theres always something new to happen in the game thanks to the community in all its toxcicty. i 100% recommend this game to anyone that likes a challenge and wants to be apart of a community that really and truly cares about this game,Rust

I know I spent a lot of hours on this game I got addicted to building..Nevertheless this game's community is terrible the people are unpleasant and certain game mechanics are flawed and aren't thought through enough. This game rewards highly a playstyle of a bandit and attracts the worst of people. At the moment I can't recommend this game.,Rust
2018-02-01,0,0,3823,True,Recommended,If you enjoy A Friendly Community Hours of Fun Minimal GrindThen run far far far away from this game.

2018-07-14,0,0,407,False,Recommended,Rust is a pretty cool game even though there are still many problems with it but what would you expect from an Early Access game? Very toxic community and annoying roofcampers deal with it still good to play with friends you can team with many many people like a big clan to destroy everyone and raid bases together Recommended for survival lovers pretty hard for new to this genre. The starving and dehydration is really annoying and that's a thing you'll probably die for a lot of times. (like i did) My personal vote 7.5ish/10,Rust

2014-03-15,0,0,34,True,Recommended,Considering it is still in alpha stages i would rate RUST 9/10.It's a great 'survivalist' game however i'll give you a little list of things that need to be improved... The lack of zombies. they're spread too far apart throughout the map and maybe consider that the zombies can do damage to buildings. The ridiculous 'Tetris style' Inventory system. When time is of the essence you dont want to be ing around in your backpack for half an hour! Graphics could do with tweaking.But like i said before.... it's still in Alpha stages so most of the issues will get addressed.I thoroughly enjoy playing this game so for me it's a 9/10!!,Rust

NoI absolutely love this game so far with the beginning five minutes reminding me of minecraf the forest and don't starve all rolled up into one. The game is hillarious especially when playing with friends. I will say however that this game is bittersweet depending on which fellas you are playing with.

2017-05-21,0,0,81,False,Not Recommended,"I love the idea of this game. The game itself is nice and is great except it is so damn hard to get started. The community is also extremely ed up. I can't believe I've wasted 12 hours of gathering resources about to make a base and then die and die and die and do it all again because some wanted to kill someone barely clothed. And this happens every server! The community is terrible and I wish rust would add some sort of way to prevent dying over and over again. It just is too frustrating to play. I bought it while it was on sale because honest the god it is not worth the amount it is listed for. For the amount of frustration and lack of fun there is and the community itself it is not worth that much.You can't say ""ur just bad xd"" because regardless at the beginning no matter where I go what server im on there's people everywhere that are just going to shove the barrel of their gun up my because they can.

2014-06-20,0,0,27,True,Recommended,NEW UPDATED VERSION BELOWI played Rust for a while and I came to like the game at first. It was fun but as I kept playing it was so annoying how everyone killed you and it was so hard just to craft a basic house with a sleeping bag. I finally made a house after maybe 3 4 hours of playing. Sure it might not sound like a long amount of time but it wasn't excatly so fun getting all that wood. Once I finally built it I was pretty proud of myself. Then I quit the game. Only 18 hours later I came back on and my house despawned. My house that I worked so hard for despawned! I hate that feature you lose all your stuff and it makes you play constantly if you want to keep your stuff safe. It's ridiculous plus there's the lack of crafting and how hard it is to craft many items. Definitely not worth the $20! I would give it a 5.4/10. Sure it's an early access game but still maybe it was a little too early. But if they changed the despawn feature and added more items to craft and less hackers I would give them an 8/10 but until they fix that I wouldn't really play the game again since it s a waste of money and time.Edit The despawn feature has been lightened up a bit and the hackers have slimed down tiny bit. 6.5/10Since my last review the game has been fixed a lot and I like that. Though it has it's fair share of frustrations the new crafting system and interface makes up for it. It's great fun with friends or jsut meeting random people. Not a game for mac though!That review is trash Rust is lit as who doesn't love running around naked beating people to with rocks?,Rust

2014-12-21,0,0,1,True,Recommended,I was unsure whether to recommend or to NOT recommend this game. If it wasn't for the fact that it is still in the Alpha stage I wouldn't recommend it. The game itself is interesting and certainly playable.One of the many problems this game has is that you cannot play solo. If you wish to play by yourself you have to join a server that no one else is playing.Also the game itself would be more fun if you could find more things in the world.Here is a list of the things I wish could be changed Spawning. Every server I join starts with saying I have died and then I spawn somewhere that's a dangerous place to be so I have to leave immediately (radioactivity). The ability to play solo. Adjustable graphics settings. Motion blur ALWAYS makes any game I own lag way more than it should. Therefore I usually turn off this setting. But in Rust there are no adjustable settings that I have been able to find.But I must say that the game itself isn't too bad. You can craft and build and hunt all with nice graphics.,Rust

2015-04-03,0,0,207,True,Not Recommended,"Let's get things straight. I love rust. I love the feel of it. Not having to deal with 16x16 blocks and instead being able to build what you want where you want when you want. There are more weapons more tools and ways to repair them. Radiation and PVE are both good ideas. But at the same time those things are all made unimportant except when you have a mind for PVP.If Rust had a singleplayer mode or even a way to protect your buildings past ""here put this cupboard somewhere people can't break it so they can only destroy with items they've likely spawned in"" so you have an option to not deal with the horrid PVP. I'm not asking for a creative mode no I realize Rust's playerbase is it's lifeblood but I'm sick and tired of having a modest wooden house that some douchecanoe sees as just another person to conquer even though they already have all of the blueprints and all of the weapons/wood/metal/stones/tools/buildings they need.So no I don't recommend rust because it along with every other ""survival"" game out there has some sort of horrid mandatory PVP aspect that nobody can really opt out of.",Rust

2014-02-25,0,0,1776,False,Recommended,Rust is a unforgiving pvp survival sandboxRust will test your patience. It will test your ability to endure failure. Rust rewards those who play the whole day through wee hours.Not for the weak.I'm eager to see what the future holds for this one. While it's safe to say that I've recently become familiar with the consepts of crafting and surviving in general this game still offered a new and fresh experiense for me and I've already had dozens of hours fun time playing it.However there is still very much to wait for in terms of new content and bug fixing as well as anti hacking. At this point of development I would say that it isn't worth its price unless you have good friends to play it with or if you would get a big discount for it.EDIT Currently as of April 2017 there is a major hacker epidemic going on. And for that reason alone I can't recommend to buy this game currently. It has made the game literally unplayable for me.EDIT 2 July 2018 No more noticeable hacking. Development has been going in the right direction.Rust is still a long way from a finished product but updates are flowing in constantly. At the current pace it seems that maybe after 2 3 years the game will finally be finished.I can recommend the game again.For casual players I would wait until the game is complete.

2018-07-05,0,0,47,False,Recommended,"Rust the game we are talking about is a very fun and neat game. It has so much content to offer you could spend hundreds and thousands of hours and not get very bored. I highly reccomend you and possibly your friends to get and play the game. The reason why I say ""Friends"" is because of the fact that rust inspires you to have a person to watch your back. And it's hard to have a solo game and not end up completely naked. It even has a system to almost revive people. But even without friends it still can be fun! My point is if you're in the mood for a good survival game rust is the answer. But even though I have said wonderful things about the game there are a couple of things you should be aware of before entering. BAD TRAITS Now as with all succesful games there are big bad traits of it. It's very natural. So some examples for rust are It can take a while to get into a good server or one with good ping. It could take a couple minutes before you can load the server and after that it can take even longer! My first time I got on a server it took 10 min atleast. So there you are. You just got into a server then you start to wonder ""What should I do?"". Rust is hard to first learn like many other games. But for rust the first moments are much more cruel. It can make you hate the game at a instant. Also watch out before you buy this and check the requirments for the game. Make sure your PC is up to date with them or you will suffer. Moving on lets say you just spawned everything is beautiful and you know the basics. So your harvesting trees then all of a sudden a person with a bow headshots you twice bringing you down. Thing is this person is 1/8 of the map away or 2/8. There are cheaters in the community like other games. And to be honest it isnt too bad but Im just saying this to let you understand that it is a bit common to see them. But other than these things and a couple of bugs and glitching it's pretty much fine. CONCLUSION Rust is a great game and though it has some problems it is all round a really neat game and I highly reccomend to you if you dont have it. It is a bit costy but it's worth every dollar. If you dont want to pay that much just wait for a sale. Anyways I conclude my giant talk about the game and I hope you get it and enjoy yourself. If you need any tips on it go to rustyard or watch some yt vids. Anyways thanks for reading and have a great day!",Rust
2017-06-27,0,0,206,False,Not Recommended,This game could be so great but unfortunately the toxic community is quite honestly the biggest contributing factor to this games downfall. Another key reason on why Rust has become less than liked by many is the optimization Rust runs rather poorly even on some of the most highly specced machines especially when raiding and rendering enormous objects. This forces those who have spent large amounts of money on high end machines to dial back the settings which they should be able to enjoy (in all their glory) in order to obtain reasonable performance.,Rust

2016-04-25,0,0,107,False,Recommended,"I remember the first time I logged in like yesterday. I came into the world naked a man a rock and a dangling in the shadows. I was alone and obviously far from others. I gathered resources built a house got chased by zombie looking bears. I managed to escape. I had heard stories of death and destruction. I saw none of that for a few days. Then one night sitting ontop of my house with a fire going in the moonlight. I saw torches coming through the woods. Five of them I put out my fire and hid in my house. I grabbed my pipe gun and feared the worst. Then voices at my front door ""Hey dude wanna join us?"" I was hesitant at first. After seeing youtube videos I decided to chance it. I opened my door and they walked me to a huge house with a few other houses scattered around it. I was like cool. Then some guy says ""Hey that is the guy that robbed my house the other night!"" Before I could even retort my innocence. I was met with a gun blast to the head. When I respawned at my house the sun was up and 20 people outside my house and boom the wall exploded. They rushed me and killed me again. After ramsacking my house I logged back in with one apologizing they found nothing in my house to indicate I was the person that robbed him as I had nothing. Made friends and built a nice house with a large group. Next day.... server was reset everything was gone. Recently I logged back in on another server. It was a PVM so I ran around in the night looking for anything. Something was odd. I had a rock and a torch and big boobies. WTF? I could see them in the shadows of the sun coming up against the rocks. Hey where did my dangling go? Man this justs feels umm wrong. I check my paper doll and staring at me is a bald big booby woman. Logged out checked the forums. Seems I am stuck this way. Yeah umm not sure I wanna run around as a naked chick. Pros Was a good game. Lots to do and explore.Lots of new stuff It has women toons now.Uninstall works great.Was good while it lasted.Cons Not liking they removed my Actually preferred the game back when it had zombies.No zombies.I love female body parts I really do. I just don't want to run around feeling like Catlin Jenner. I miss my I want my back. If I wanted to play as female. I will Bruce Jenner my off and get plastic surgery. Just kinda sad I didn't play with them first before I logged out and uninstalled.Yet it is still a good game just wish you could choose gender.",Rust

2014-02-09,0,0,131,True,Recommended,This game is a ton of fun. Its like a mixture between DayZ and Minecraft where you have the opportunity to join many different servers.

2015-06-17,0,0,43,True,Recommended,Rust is a survival game a lot like DayZ and H1Z1 where you spawn in a world with a rock and a torch and you have to collect materials from places and make bases and find players. Sound great but this game the more I have realized has just turned into a rock and tree collecting simulator as you really don't find people that often and raiding is only really possible if you have C4 which is very rare to find. Yes I said find. You can't make it you have to find a blueprint for it in a barrell somewhere in the map. There are no fun gamemodes like H1Z1 has it's just straight up survival. Now don't get me wrong I really like this game but compared to other survival games it's not better.Pros and Cons + Great graphics and animations+ Big open worlds+ Animals C4 is impossible to find making base raiding also impossible It is mostly just farming materials when you make a house Good game needs more to be better than or close to H1Z1 or ARK Survival Evolved,Rust

2015-06-09,0,0,35,True,Recommended,honestly i loved this game. spent many hours playing with a group of friends. the major drawback is the fact that if you work or spend large times away from the computer due to real life responsibilities you are punished for it. it's honestly a good game to spent a few days on with a group of friends but don't expect your achievements to last long by any means.also beware that some servers do tend to not be honest.during my last play the server was marked so that all built objects would not degrade over time so i spent a whole day getting resources to build a nice house in a secluded location. stopped playing due to work for 2 days only to find that my house was gone but i wasn't killed or anything. it just degraded along with everything i stored.but i will recommend it beause the fun that can be had can be ridiculous.,Rust

I am able to fixe the ground issue by switching to the stable version on my Arch Linux OS...although i have met many players with the same issue (Windows and Linux users) and it seems to be due to the resent update so when the next update is released i will switch back the expeaemental...because stable is limeted to servers/players and im sick of playing alone. all and all i rate it at 9/10 and i'm sure the next update will fix the expearemental version but it is early alpha so i knew i could expearience this when i puchased it. i've never ""no lifed"" a game untill i've played rust so that should speak volumes in words as i like to play many games.Pros ConsSmooth Seethrough/invisible ground issueGood GraphicsEmersiveFunMostly realisticnative to Linux OS",Rust

2014-02-09,0,0,25,True,Not Recommended,I wish I hadn't paid 20$ for this game. Garry basically took the unity3d engine added some ugly models a build system and a weak combat system. All the hard stuff like procedural terrain and tree generation pathing 3d rendering positional audio etc is all provided by unity (which is free). Every patch has a tendancy to break many mods that make the game playable and usually requires a server reset. There's no way to load custom maps nor can you run your own dedicated server without begging Garry on the forum for a beta key. It's still fun ish but as it is now it's not worth 5$.,Rust
2014-02-09,0,0,731,True,Recommended,Holy almost 400 hours into this game. You will not believe what I've been through. Good and bad there's ALOT more to this game than you think. You spawn with a rock torch and two bandages. Now you go and gather wood and resources to stay alive and if you're lucky maybe a friend or two will help ya. This game got me to the edge of my seat and my heart pumping it made my back hurt and I passed out for a bit. Everything about this game is wonderful. From the Radiation towns to the crazy forests where I get lost this game changed the way I thought about open world mmo games. Very well done indeed Facepunch. Now just keep those updates rolling!

Being in alpha though I don't have much of a desire to put a ton of time into it because I know that during Beta i'll have everything erased and again from Beta to full release. I hope the game doesn't change too much from now to final release because it really is something special. Only thing I wish for is that there were some lockboxes that could hold a couple items that nobody can ever touch. My entire experience has been playing for 4 5 hours and either dying and losing all that progress or relogging and killed while offline and lost that same progress.,Rust

You'll dream about it you'll worry about your base while you're offline. This game is a lesson in psychology and defensive maneuvers. I would absolutely recommend this game if you have friends who play too. Soloing in this game is extremely difficult and you'll learn quickly that no one can be trusted everyone is your enemy.Warning if you already have high blood pressure this game may literally end your life.,Rust
2014-11-22,0,0,375,True,Recommended,soo i guess to start off this is a pretty sweet game. realistic in some ways utter bs in others. the hackers are a annoying and honestly i have never seen anything done about it soo clearly theyre here to stay because some admins wont just hit the kick button. OTHER than hackers this game is amazing. the ai controlled animals are quite predictable but can still provide a good challenge at certain times through the game whether its taking a wrong turn in a rad town with only a rock or hatchet or losing an enemy in a nice field of bears and wolves. its fun building a base and being able to wage war with whomever looks dangerous. gets alot better with friends especially when you form a group in game and raid the big homes and build walls around the small ones. the experimental version i havnt played enough to form an opinion on soo will update when i feel its gotten to a more playable phase. im not sure what the devs backgrounds are like and im starting to feel (with how far along dayz 7 days to die etc are) that they bit off more than they can chew. i respect that they still put out updates and communicate to a degree with the community but they need to make this worth playing the experimental. whether this was a waste of money and time idk yet but for 20 bucks ive had plenty of fun with more to come. worth a try if u like building im giving it a 6.5/10 for now. put rad towns and loot crates back and ill make that a 7.5.,Rust
2014-11-22,0,0,8,True,Not Recommended,This game turned out to be a real let down. When I originally bought it it was supposed to be a zombie survival style game. Than b/c it was apparently to difficult to get that portion of the game right they dropped it. That right there was a buzz kill. Since than it has been getting improved however the gaming community is just ruthless and the fact that you start off being hunted like a piece of meat with nothing but a rock to defend yourself really doesn't help. Now if you are able to spawn in and get to a secluded area it's actually not bad. Especially once you get going with your resources and building up. The reason I would not recommend it is because any game where it starts as one thing than that thing is to hard to do so the devs drop it is not a game the devs are truly trying to get working the way they initially scripted it. And that to me is a huge blow to the devs. With a friend it's a good game to kill time if you can get seperated from all the people just looking for free kills.,Rust
2014-11-22,0,0,6,True,Recommended,4/5 Great game a little on the laggy side but I assume that's my computer. Graphincs are good even on the lowest setting. It is a very difficult game with all the stuff trying to kill you (including the enviroment) but it is fun regardless.,Rust

2017-01-10,0,0,3,True,Recommended,Meh. You start the game naked with a rock and a torch. No idea what the objective is no idea what to do or where to go. (Free range map.) The tutorial was limited to a quick list of what the keys are. You die pretty quick whether it's a bear slowly starving (some area have very limited food to find) or one of the numerous other players kills you for no reason. You then respawn (in a random spot) with a rock and a torch. All the items you found are gone. If you google how to play you learn you need to make a building and a sleeping bag to 'save' your progress but other people will quickly steal your items if you don't google how to build a building with a lock and storage containers. All in all it's a decent game with a good idea but the lack of any tutorial and the mass of people who just kill every noob they see make it very difficult to get started.,Rust

With that being said I thought it would be beneficial to have an objective review of this game from day 1 literally so that new players can actually determine what the truth is on this game.Alright lets start from the top.BuildingBuilding in this game has stayed more or less constant over the last year or so since the rework from Legacy and in my opinion it is far better than Legacy in most aspects. For me building in Legacy Rust was truly terrifying and not because of raiders. In Legacy if you misplaced even one pillar there was a pretty good chance that your entire base would be ruined forever because there was no hammer to destroy with and no levels of strength such as twig that make it easy to destroy until its upgraded. Whatever you put there stayed there until an Admin removed it or it was blown up. I cannot even explain the rage of farming up 15k wood (that was a lot in Legacy) and building the exact specs for your dream base storing them having an armored escort to go build said base and have one pillar lag out and be misplaced ruining your base forever. This is one great strength of the new building system. The addition of the building plan multileveling walls and the hammer was truly a relieving addition from Facepunch and that is what makes the new building system a lot better than the Legacy system.Nothing is perfect however. With the new building system came Tool Cupboards. Facepunch had a very good reason to add this item to the game as it was to prevent raiders from being able to build right up the side of your base like they were able to do in Legacy. But with adding this item comes a whole bunch of problems that still plagues Rust today. Mainly if the raiders get to your tool cupboard its pretty much GG and there's no way to really change that. There was a certain honor in building a base that was ""Raid proof"" and defending it to the end and if the raiders beat you they beat you. Today however they can simply use 2 c4 or 4 rockets in some cases take the cupboard build up your airlocks or honeycombs and get the loot far easier if they hadn't be able to. This to me is a fatal flaw in the building system even though it is FAR superior to the original system in Legacy. Despite Facepunch trying a bunch of updates and patches and fixes to attempt to remedy this problem I don't think that it is simple possible with such an important and powerful item in the base to simply negate its effects. Yes hatch doors make things MUCH better than stair airlocks but it still doesn't fully solve the problem because raiders can still build up to hatches they otherwise would not be able to reach.CraftingWow where do you start here. This topic has been the fighting words of Rust since day one. Whether it was the BP XP or the new component system there is just so many things to consider when analyzing the crafting in this game. For me the current crafting system in this game is SUFFICIENT. The component system does its job for the most part. I think that there was a very good side to the OG BP system that was in Legacy and although there is no system that can perfectly cover all aspects of crafting I think that the BP system felt the best over a long period of time. However the component system in this game does prevent massive groups of people from getting way to powerful in early game but once a certain threshold is reached there is no stopping anyone with this system. The components such as rifle bodies and others are just too easy to find at Mil Tunnels and other monuments in the game. If I ran monuments for 5 hours I'd have enough rifle bodies for an army of AK's and enough tech trash to smash anyone on the server and thats just me. With groups of 5 plus there's no stopping people from having very powerful components after about a day. RaidingOuch. Raiding in Legacy was fun. This game was interesting to me soley because I could steal from others. Why bother doing any hard work when I can take what someone else worked hard for? Raiding in this game is a shell of what it used to be. The days of attacking a base with defenders fighting for their lives are gone. My main problem with the raiding in this game is the ability to repair walls or build new ones in the midst of a raid. Why bother using satchel charges over c4 if the defender can just repair the wall as you go or place a new one as soon as the old one is blown off. And that's just the start. The implementation of an overwhleming number overly powerful defense mechanisms in bases or simply boring raiding due to tool cupboards make the raiding experience woefully incomplete. Imagine farming sulfur for 3 days (I'll get into that later) crafting rockets building the raid base working your way into the base just to have the loot despawned. Its pathetic. There has to be some sort of mechanism to ensure raiders get the loot that is inside the base. And that's if you can get past the autoturrets high external stone walls land mines bear traps repaired walls and airlocks. The trade off between what is needed to raid and what is needed to build a base is well out of proportion. In my experience it took a group of 11 people 3 days of farming to raid and loot one base that was built by a solo player. How is that a balanced system? Also raids are either way too difficult or way to easy making them boring. I have never raided a base successfully that contains a motherload of loot nor have I raided a base unsuccessfully that contains very little loot. There is simply a curve that is too steep for raiders to get into bases that are actually enjoyable to raid. I mean google ""Epic Rust Raid Cam"" and you'll be left wondering how was that worth for the raiders? And how can a group of 30 40 people barely get into a base built by 5? Needless to say Raiding in the new Rust has been my biggest letdown in this game. FarmingOuch again. This game could easily be renamed farming simulator and its not just some joke its true. The amount of time a group of 10 people have to spend to earn the resources they need to pull off anything worthwhile in this game is mindboggling. My group of 6 each spent 105 hours over a week and half playing the game and were BARELY able to resource enough sulfur to pull off ONE meaningful raid on the last day of the 2 week wipe cycle on a base of 5 people. Along with this complaint is my main issue with farming and ultimately raiding in this game its pointless at times. Why bother farming 120k stone for a base when you could lose it and just farm it back in a day. Why bother farming to raid a base of your enemy when they can just farm back what they lost in under 24 hours? This game at times is literally a farm fest. Whoever plays the most and is the most active wins period. OverviewI loved this game. It is undoubtedly the best game I have ever purchased and it was truly an enjoyable experience for me to play. With that being said I think that the current path the game is on although not soley the fault of the devs is going to bring the demise of this game in the future. There are simply too many shortcomings for me that greatly devalue the experience and the end game wipe cycles mind boggling amount of time farming etc. I cannot say that I would recommend someone to buy this game as it CURRENTLY is because you require so much time friends and knowledge the of the game to even compete on servers. Although I can't recommend it Rust is still a hell of a game or at least it used to be. Zink",Rust
2016-11-25,0,0,583,True,Recommended,I would recommend this game to anyone. Just keep in mind that when you start its better to begin your learning on a low population server. This way you can learn the mechanics of the game and understand how the irradiated world works. The reason I mention this is because there are a LOT of trolls in Rust. As long as you take the time to learn watch some videos and enjoy yourself while surviving in an unforgiving landscape filled with looters and wolves and bears and cactus... Just play it you won't be sorry.My rating 9/10This game has a lot yet to be seen but the amazing mod community working on Oxide products more than make up for what the game lacks in its current state. Can't wait to see whats next!,Rust
2017-01-10,0,0,9,True,Recommended,Product received for free. For it being in Alpha it is a very good game. Don't get me wrong there are still bugs like a horse just straight up walking through a creek not swimming BUT WALKING!!!! Let it be known though that nobody is your friend in Rust. Be very careful who you befriend as they can very easily turn their back on you and kill you. Avoid the helicopter at all costs that thing is the devil and wil devour you and keep on moving. But overall I like the game a lot and for sure would recommend it to a friend.,Rust
2017-01-10,0,0,68,True,Recommended,I was hesitant to buy this based on some of the reviews I had read. I am glad that I made the purchase even though I am playing solo. It can be frustrating at first but if you find a decent server and perservere it can be quite enjoyable especially once you build a base/sleeping bag. There are a lot of griefers but there are quite a few helpful people as well from what I can gather. Rust certainly isn't going to be for everyone but it seems to accomplish it's goal quite well.I have never had some of the adrenaline rushes that I have experienced over the past 15 hours since I started playing this game. I can honestly say I have laughed out loud while I am running naked through the woods with nothing but a spear all the while being hunted by a veteran with an AK47.Do yourself a favor and gather wood/cloth as quickly as you can so you can make a base and a sleeping bag. Once you have the bag you respawn in your base and (hopefully) wont have to start from scratch as often.Good luck but stay the hell away from me ),Rust

2018-09-13,0,0,598,False,Recommended,I want to love this game and a huge part of me does. I just can't get over how the game rewards toxic behavior and grief tactics. In order to grind materials necessary for a base and to keep yourself from getting raided you have to treat this game like a full time job. However you can grind for hours upon hours just for someone to offline raid you while you're asleep. Not only do people take your hard earned supplies they will go above and beyond to destroy things and set you back even further at no benefit to them. This game rewards socially engineering generous players and taking giant dumps on them. Forget the days of spontaneously making new and rewarding friendships in game.

2018-09-13,0,0,608,False,Not Recommended,Although I had enjoyed this game for 600hours I would have to not suggest it. If you have a massive group of over 10 players it will be fun. It's still too unoptimized to the point where I would go from having 80 100FPS then suddenly some random open field areas would drop me to mid 40's. Thats with a 4th gen i7 and a GTX 1070. Solo is pretty much unplayable now with the upkeep. Researching new blueprints takes too long for a solo player. 750 scrap for one item? It just isn't the same game it used to be.,Rust
2014-11-26,0,0,921,True,Recommended,"Amazing game. However I will warn the new players that this game has a very large learning curve. You'll have to learn the map learn to navigate learn to shoot learn to farm and learn to survive all at the very begining. Trust me this is a challenge and at times it can be frustrating and at other times down right disheartening. If the learning curve wasn't bad enough the majority of servers you'll be playing in are kill on sight(KOS). Granted this doesn't sound very fun once you can get passed the ""I don't know where I'm"" stage this game is very rewarding and extremely fun to play alone (as I did for the most part) or with a group of friends. Building a base raiding a base or getting raided yourself are some of the best times in this game. If you can stur up alittle drama against a clan or multiple clans the better. BUY THIS GAME.",Rust

I can run the game on 800x600 to some extent however The Inventories are not able to be moved and are super overlapped and all over the place. I'd recommend a fairly beefy graphics card and probably 8+gb of ram I mean I thought I'd be fine on a quad core AMD 2.8ghz a core 6gb ram and a Geforce GT 430 but I guess not. 800x600 Lowest settings was maybe like 45 50fps with super crappy inventory screens. If you have my specs or lower I'd suggest like a mod or something that changes menu size and the like or just wait til the game is further optimized otherwise you'll be wasting at most $19.99. I want to play more but when you can't even menu correctly How will you survive a harsh enviroment if you can barely craft.IF YOUR MACHINE IS BEEFY AND MUCH BETTER THEN MINE AND CAN RUN AT LEAST 1280x800 THEN BY ALL MEANS GET IT If not keep your distance.,Rust

2014-02-12,0,0,19,True,Recommended,I was suprised by this game to be honest. I'd been watching YouTubers play it for around 2 months and as far as I could see it looked pretty awesome however they usually cut the footage and I assumed that it would take only around 2 hours to construct a fully fledged base. I was of course wrong. This game can be both incredibly time consuming and incredibly fun. It really sucks losing your stuff after finding an M4 with 6 mags + full kevlar but in a way thats the fun of it.I would definitely recommend this game however perhaps only to the slightly older player. Experience with a Survival like DayZ with help with coping with the loss so keep that in mind.,Rust

I do still feel this game has a lot of potential and is a lot of fun. It has provided many hours of entertainment and has created many friendships through playing. I recommend this game for people who have good computers have a lot of time to play games and enjoy dying over and over until they learn how to play.

2015-07-31,0,0,840,True,Recommended,Playin Rust is a truly great experiance. the game have alot to offer from hunting animals to make clothing to building your base (out of different materials). Recently new updates have added a mining quarry and a oil rig to help you collect resources. To be able to craft the more usefull items you have to find the blueprints for that item or if you find the item you can research it then craft it yourself. So players are in that aspect forced out of their homes so they can't just sit and hide all day. Also people tend to raid others quit often so try to build your base as strong as possible rather than building it big. I would recomend this game to Everyone it is really fun!,Rust

In the good ol days people like me (solo lads) could sit out in the middle of the forest and hit trees and rocks untill I had all of the things required to make cool guns and bases. Now the only (realistic) way to progress is join a large clan/ group and farm the rad towns. I dislike this because it makes pvp a near requirement and forces people to build pvp hotzones. I much prefered the game when I never had to see another player my entire game unless I wanted to. so in summary I dislike the new blueprint system/ scrap system.,Rust

By this i mean that you could have loot without killing anybody and yeah someone will kill you but that was like 25% of the time. This was legacy.Then the weekly updates started adding... weapons.attachmentsSKINS FOR WEAPONSeven more weaponsnew raiding toolsCARS ARE GETTING INTO THE GAME (even the biggest map is too small for a car)With these awful and useless additions to the game the developers didn't have time to produce quality content and only gave us weapons and weapons and weapons...SINCE EARLY ACCESS THERE HAS ONLY BEEN 1 MORE ARMOUR AND CLOTHING SET and that's just sadonly 2 SETS OF TOOLS ARE NEW TO EARLY ACCESS.Now the game is PVP ONLY. The only place where you'd actually find friendly people is nowhere. There are modded servers but it's too easy on them and the fun of grinding for your base is basically gone. The official servers have rules for no s and toxic players and yet everybody spews racial slurs kills on sight and just tries to harm the community whenever he can.If you check the older reviews wayyy below mine you'll see how good the game WAS and how many positive reviews there WERE.i have 578 hours in this game and i do not regret them. I've played Rust when it was actually good and worth the time invested into it. If you wish to play it now just go play Fortnite. It's basically the same at this point.THE GAME WAS FUN AND ENJOYABLE don't get me wrong but Facepunch made it into a battle royale. Fukc you Facepunch for ruining a great game.,Rust
2018-01-15,0,0,4331,True,Recommended,One of my most favorite survival games by far. I would definitely recommend to anyone whose into the whole sandbox survival type of games. This game has delivered quite an interesting experience for me in my opinion. What first started out during the first introduction of blueprints has had me going through the game to the new BP system.Through this game surprisingly i've made some pretty decent friends people who are actually down to Earth. But the rush this game has always been something I have never had. You get something of value but don't have a house yet? You have to play in a way that you try to keep this item while staying alive. Sometimes things don't always go as planned and you have to try make a play to fix that mistake. The randomness of this game is what sometimes makes it great. Killing someone who has tons of loot getting into massive fights honestly is the best part. Playing solo is a challenge that I love personally and pushes me to greater heights in game sense and PvP. Playing with friends/group? Well things get a bit easier and maybe more fun depending on how you see it. Didn't take a helicopter until I played with a group and it was an amazing experience.Would love to play more and seriously recommend but the amount of scripting and hackers on official servers in which I frequent are just insane now. ($5 accounts are being sold with only Rust on the account and people just hack on em') Officials are the only servers that really stay populated and hold many new players. Think officials where most people get started since most secure servers require an hour limit are not the best anymore for newer players and if you are new you should move to a community server (but those die off quick). In the end it's up for the individual to decide. Every decision in this game that you make counts. ),Rust

Theres something about how no matter how much you work grind and struggle everything can still be taken out from under you. It's and unforgiving survival game easily one of the more challenging ones and depending on you personal ability you will make it a certain length through material possesion. I hate to say it but it really is quantity over quality sometimes. The clans here are only there because they work. They roll over the smaller guys. Thats the reason duo and trio servers work.

It does lack some substance at the moment but the basics of the game and pvp element make it tons of fun.

2014-03-29,0,0,724,True,Recommended,Probably one of the best games i have ever owned! I recommend this game to anyone who likes to survive and build stuff. This is not a game! This is survival of the fittest! For this game follow your natural instinct as it guides you to victory! p.s and by victory i mean a successful raid!,Rust

2014-03-29,0,0,85,True,Not Recommended,"Fun at first.. Trying to build all these things.. and trying to do all combinations of defense/offense/surviving.. etc..Once you really get into it the game gets bland and boring quick..Yes it's Alpha.. but updates are few and far between.. abusive admins lots of hacking bad coding major game breaking glitches... Wait till its BETA or it might ruin our experience..This game could be great we will see.. Side Note Think the ""early release"" was a money grab and i honestly don't ever think the game will ever be finished.. and if it does it will have long faded out and others will have mastered this genre..3/10",Rust
