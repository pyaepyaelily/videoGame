0,77059132,english,"400 hrs and counting. perfect game for anyone who wants to play a combination RTS / turn-based strategy game. this is something that is both merciless and yet easy to grasp and tame. it is merciless because you can play 100 hrs on a campaign and lose. just flat out lose because you let some other faction roll you early on and you did nothing about it and you didn't realize how big of a mistake you made until it was wayyy too late. this is ultimately why i like the game - because it plays more like a simulator.

the easiness of outsmarting the AI in the land battles is offset by the fact that on the campaign map the AI will have massive armies all the time that come seemingly out of nowhere on higher difficulties. the factions will also all eventually turn against you. you versus the world. your 5:1 k/d ratio needs to be consistent or just one battle that ends poorly where your typical AI outsmarting strategies failed will cost you a region and perhaps the campaign.

also if you refuse to save and reload you will have a really, really tough time on higher difficulties. a ""legendary"" difficulty would solve this problem which is why i like other total war titles more. but this one is still solid",1601868664,1601868664,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198025493296,44,3,24033,0,24033,1594858243
1,77055589,english,"This game is the one of the worst total war game out there, a gigantic waste of my money.

-The AI is retarded.

The AI won't accept the most beneficial diplomatic offer. If it does, it makes the most bizarre and utterly stupid agreements. It also can't play battles for anything. I can place a rock on my chair and it would put up a better fight.

-The battles are stupid. 

Fort battles are a chore, as well as city maps. You have to micro the absolute heck out of everything. The troops are also super inaccurate. I can line up 120 elite men and they will ultimately kill ~10 men at most. This goes for cannons as well. They're useless unless you use them to destroy fort walls, and in that case only regular early-game cannons are worth anything. Rocket Troops and mortars are useless. So basically it's just line infantry spam with the occasional use of basic artillery when there's an annoying fort somewhere. 

My absolute biggest pet peeve of battles (this was the catalyst that made me uninstall the game) is when the AI puts units at the edge of the map and just makes them sit there. Why is this bad, you may ask? Because there is a time limit for battles. Even if you have 3 fresh regiments, if the enemy still has 1 cannon stranded in the middle of nowhere when time runs out, you lose. This made me lose a battle in which I sent >2000 riflemen against their swordsmen. 

-You can only play a select few factions.

There are 42 factions at the start of the game. Sounds cool right? Wrong. Only 11 are playable. The map doesn't even span the whole world, it only spans parts of the Americas, Europe, India, the Middle East, and small parts of Northern Africa. Yay.

Overall, this is a bad total war game. The only thing saving it from being the worst is the fact that this is set during the 1700's and there aren't many other total war games that are similar to this time period. Sure, this game can be fun sometimes, but it's pretty much a waste of money.",1601861895,1601861895,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198966473713,10,2,6436,716,6436,1601860484

From Foot Batteries to Ships-of-the-Line. I can think of few other games that depict 18th century warfare and the age of colonialism and imperialism on such a grand scale as well as this game. 

Presentation is pretty good overall though settlements on the campaign map may be a bit too small to see when fully zoomed out meaning you may not realise you can upgrade building updates (especially if you have turned off the advisor). 


In terms of replayability, there's lots of it. The Road to Independence campaign which basically depicts the rise of the United States from settlers in Virginia during the end of the 17th century, the French and Indian war where you play as the Thirteen Colonies to the full on Revolutionary War. This is intended as a tutorial for the main Grand Campaign mode (and also unlocks the United States as a faction for the main campaign, set at a later date however rather than starting at 1700). 

The Grand Campaign itself is probably the highlight of the single player experience. Here you pick a faction (and believe me there are lots) and start managing your empire. It can take several days to finish a campaign and even once you have met your victory conditions, the game gives you the option to continue the save at any time should you wish to do full map completion. The campaign mechanics are pretty in depth as far as total war games are concerned with the ability to manage taxes, your government ministers, build farms to develop villages into towns, then upgrade those towns and more though if you played something like Civilisation, it may be simpler than what you are used to. 

There's also the ability to play historical/scenario battles (which are basically pre-set armies) and also play custom battles. Finally there's multiplayer for those who prefer a human challenge. 

 
The game does show it's age however and it is a bit clunkier compared to the newer total war games though there's still plenty of fun to have. In some areas it is even better, such as campaign depth/mechanics and imo naval battles were at their best in this game. Battles are pretty fun as well though as is the nature of combat of the time, they can be quite slow and you may fine yourself and the AI trading artillery barrages for several minutes. 

As a final note, I highly recommend you check out the excellent DarthMod for this game. It makes many improvements to the game overall (too many to list here) such as improving the AI, larger unit sizes, more factions/campaigns as well as VFX improvements, particularly smoke from cannon and musket fire.",1402640340,1600599329,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198129240841,29,5,20845,196,20649,1601106617

Except this time with ranged units to all heck! Everyone has a gun! hoora for capitalism!

jokes aside, the game plays fine. Plays just like any other total war game. with fairly in depth economy management mechanics, and detailed enough battlefield mechanics. It's your classic 4x strategy game, with a tad more interactive combat than something like stellaris. (No offense stellaris, your game is epic.)

Good stuff!

however i will say it's major downfall is total war's cheesy  AI. i can sit in my fort which im supposed to sit in anyway SINCE IM DEFENDING IT! for like 4 literal real life hours, without a single movement from the AI. other than breaking a few walls. They want you to waste resources so they win. Except doing it that way is dumb and breaks game immersion. So for that if there was a star rating system on steam, i would rate it 4.3 outa 5 stars. Not bad, but could use some improvement. :)

18,3916039,english,"Empire Total War, was at the time of its conception, creative assembly's most ambitious game. That ambition from 2009 is still impressive over a decade later. First you have two campaigns (Three if you get the warpath dlc or buy the definitive edition). The first campaign is an episodic objective based campaign that is broken up into unlockable sections which unlock more of the map. This is for the main story line which is based around the American War of Independence (1770s). However the more important campaign is the grand campaign where you can pick from several nations in 1700 Europe, the Middle East or India (mods let you play as any nation in the game though) The map for empire is extremely large in scale, it includes All of Europe, North Africa, Middle East, India, the Eastern Part of North America, Central America and even some of Northern South America. There's also trading ports you can dock merchant fleets at across the world. 

Gran Campaign 
Pros
- Large map
- Many nations with diversity of units and cultures makes each battle unique 
- Naval warfare 
- Encompasses a long time frame (1700-1830s)
- There are region specific units as well as ones unique to certain government types and cultures so if you conquer land in North Africa you can recruit North African units, If you conquer land in the Americas you can recruit native Americans and so on. 
- You can buy and sell regions (however for AI to except you will probablly need to offer them one in a trade)
Cons
- Long wait times for certain nations (it is turn based after all)
- The AI is bad at negotiations and often can't be appeased
- Units don't need generals, so you can have as many single unit armies marching around as you want..... as well as the AI.  This can slow down turn times late game when every country has alot of random units just laying around. 
- Crashes are rare but do happen, especially after several hundred turns into a campaign (Save games frequently)
- Only Singleplayer 


Actual Combat 
Empire Total War has two parts, one part real time battles and one part turn based empire manage. (Multiplayer exists but only for the former)

- The AI can use tactics but more common than not the AI will just try to move it's army up to yours so everyone's in firing rang of each other. If they have horse based units they might try a half assed flank. Cannons and artillery exist and sometimes the AI positions them to where they can't hit anything. 

Naval combat 
- can be a little slow..... ships are clunky but its cool to see large three story ships with 50 cannons a side shooting at other large ships... and sinking them. 



This game was ahead of its time and luckily its still pretty cool now, especially if your pc can't run the newer total war games or you really just want your units to use muskets. For $25 its well worth it.

Creative assembly was my favorite studio for a long time until they just gave up on their own products. I stopped playing their games after TW Rome 2. Whats sad is that no other games get the level of tactical strategic battlefield gameplay that there games achieve. Too bad theyre unoptimized, the AI is trash, the UI is trash, units are barely distinguishable and the campaign is just a joke. Its like they dont even play their own games, do you think its fun having the barbary pirates ask for money every turn?! How about when your artillery spends five eternities getting into position, then when you detach them from the horse they decide to turn 90 degrees and most of the time are more dangerous to your own units. The AI is so bad they HAD to give them an advantage at siege battles and you jsut start with two walls down, like WTF? I have to spend 20 damn minutes breaking their walls but you just GIVE the AI wall breaches? And then they still run around like retards?! Pretty much every game is a clone of the last and this is obvious, look at the size of the battlefields, look at the number of units, the artillery units all the same since Shogun! Then you get to this game, a game where its been over ten years and they were not able to actually make it playable. CA I hate/love you and I wont give you any money anymore out of principle. This game has such a place in my heart because I played it when I was younger and its even worse then I remember.

84,74106881,english,"Getting this out of the way first, not my favorite Total War, may even be my least liked one of the series.

As I recall, this was the first game of the series that tried to implement a provincial type system where you have your main city and then minor towns attached to it. It certainly lowers the amount of sheer sieges you have to do in order to gain land, which can cut down on redundancy. However in this game, there's no menu for controlling all the buildings in the province, which means that you have to manually check each minor town to see if it can be upgraded or not. There's a small icon that you may be able to see on the map but you have to actually be looking at it. That system can be a tad annoying to follow, especially when compared to their more recent games like Three Kingdoms which puts everyone on a list at the side of the screen telling you if you can upgrade something.

Battles are easy as hell, and you don't need to put very much thought into pretty well anything when ti comes to army composition, you can win the game by spamming line infantry only. All you gotta do, is get the fire by rank technology, then spam nothing but line infantry and send them in one giant line across the map and you win, you don't need cavalry bayonettes from the line infantry are like spear men, they murder cavalry, you don't need cannons because they are too inaccurate to do real damage to enemies before they reach you, you don't need any melee troops because they get wrecked by line infantry because they even get close, and if they do get close line infantry use bayonettes to be melee troops. Your one size fits all army is Line Infantry...and they are spammable, there's no limit to how many you can have. Militia have too low morale so they end up just running, grenaders are basically just crappy line infantry with a single special skill that does as much as line infantry.

For navel battles, brigs are your line infantry. While not the strongest ship on the sea, they are cheap enough to spam to the point where having a monster ship don't matter.

I really do think the multi-continental map is a pretty neat idea, although this is a little better expanded upon in alter games, such as Warhammer Total War. All good things have to start somewhere, and this is the game that started that one, along with the province setup.

Graphically, its pretty good for its time. Unit control in the battles feels old, there's options that ought to be there that are not which sometimes makes it frustrating to command your armies, especially if you like to group them.

Technology is a little different in this, where you can actually research like 4 things at once so long as you have the schools to do so, which means you could really out tech your enemies fairly easy.

If you like this era of time however, this is pretty good. From my limited knowledge, this does appear to be how they fought, in lines and such, so it would be good to get into.

I recommend this because no total war is bad enough to ever give a thumbs down, and I guess even though its my least favorite Total War, its still not a bad game.",1597101658,1597101658,True,0,0,0.461218804121017456,0,True,False,False,76561198007273581,222,23,6343,0,6343,1597100538

27,45326118,english,"Average game at best. I do love battles of this period but this game feels like beta. It was the the first one with Warscape engine/TW Engine 3 (32 bit) and they probably used it as paid test. This is the point where famous TW ""sheet"" optimization begins. Below i will mention good and bad things.

[h1]Campaign[/h1]

+ You can trade regions.

+ You can trade technology.

- Diplomacy is the worst i saw in TW games so far. It doesn't make sense. One modder mentioned that when Ai faction hates you, it starts with -140 penalty and will increase over time, unlike more reasonable and modern games where it will decrease over time. Expansion penalty is big. I mean in this era there were a lot of ""empires"". It's not like damn aggressive Roman expansion in antiquity. 
It is very hard to have a peace. AI doesn't want peace even after you won against them few times in a row. They can sign a peace treaty after you gave them tons of money and then attack you shortly after this.
Few times i saw same nations (like Portugal) being destroyed and then revived. 
AI attacked me a lot with small stacks. I can't remember the case when this problem was as big as in Empire.
AI logic in trade is stupid. They want regions all the time in exchange of military access. For real? Why would i give my region, especially when i don't need to walk around your country? Also i don't like guessing how much technology or region cost. Hard to trade.

- Sometimes AI army goes to local building, then away, then again near this building. I saw Venice exchanging units or something like that for too long. Waste of turn time.

- Interface is outdated by now. There is no reminder/notification tab with things like available building upgrade, idle unit etc. Not to mention public order/happiness tab. 
There is no modern building slot style. You have to find and select buildings on map instead of main city. Few buildings per province. With many regions it will become a chore. 3-5 buildings in one region. 10 and more regions. Come on...

- Workers riot too often. I lowered taxes. What else i could do? Had not enough money for buildings they like, but even then they hated me. Every turn i saw messages about ""workers strike"". A lot of rebellions. I mean like really a lot. 

- Government type change system is bad. You have to wait for revolution. I sided with rebels and they gave me one small army. My whole faction became an enemy before i captured my former capital. Thing is, while my faction was not playable my former enemies took advantage of revolution. Important regions were conquered and i had to declare war on two factions again. The benefits of different government types are not too great to justify this.

- You need to wait until the end of the year marked in campaign victory to receive achievement/ending video. If you have completed your goal too early - Prepare to play ""skip turn"" simulator.

[h1]Battle[/h1]

- Pathfinding is horrible. Cavalry was near my unit. I order my unit to attack cavalry and it took too long for them to turn around and attack. 
Custom path is also bad. Units with stop running when they change movement direction. 
Some artillery units doesn't move like regular units. I don't know the logic behind this. I tried different things from battle UI panel and nothing happened. When i used RMB, they shot at the ground. 

- Interface. Formation screen mainly. 

- Sieges are horrible. Worst sieges i saw in TW games. Empty small fort. As defender you can try shooting competition with your enemy and as attacker you can use ropes to climb the wall like action movie hero. It is too long and boring. 

- Combat pace/accuracy is bad. Units miss a lot. It makes the combat slower. Not because of morale like in more recent TW games.

[h1]DLC[/h1]

Bad. Five playable factions of Native Americans. All are identical. All are weak.

They can hide grass, forest etc but that will only make the battle longer since AI can be too lazy or stupid to come at you. 
Flanking is a requirement for natives. Of course if your units won't die before you can charge at enemy units. Even in close combat few of my units routed. Spanish cavalry was better. Bowmen are weak. They should have had better accuracy stat and/or range at least.
I took two Spanish settlements and rebellion happened soon. Around 5 units in each army. At the time when i marched to another Spanish settlement and had no local armies... I mean dealing with European rebellions as natives is a lot worse than as Europeans vs Europeans. It's not worth it.

[h1]Final[/h1]

It is one of the mods hated (maybe the most) Total War game for a good reason. As strategy, TW or just common player i don't like this game. I gave it a chance few times and it failed to show positive sides. 
Not worth the full price at all. Maybe half price, heavily modded and only main campaign as European nation. 
Diplomacy mod, Napoleon's effects and bugfixes are a ""must have"" mods. It is the time when i can say without a doubt that overhaul mod is required to enjoy this game.

44,73391859,english,"I bought this game twice. The first time, 10 years ago I returned it.

This time, I made the mistake of watching some revolutionary war documentaries. Being the history fan that I am, I figured I'd put myself in the action. I figured after 10 years, this game would have made some progress on the bugs. Considering the reviews, how could I go wrong.

This game is like eating the perfect piece of carrot cake, only to bite into it and realize that the carrots went bad. Want an example? No problem Custer, here it comes.

You spend about 200 hours building an amazing empire, just as you do in all total war games. Eventually, things come to a climax and being the world domineering pioneer that you are - send in the full might of your armies.

First of all, you can't have more than 20 units on the battlefield at once. Is that because it's an old mechanic? Maybe. However, when you put 2 armies next to each other, you would expect the reinforcement area to be somewhere near it. NOPE. Instead as your howitzers wail away, an entire enemy army spawns literally inside you. I don't mind a bug or the occasional crash, which happens.

But for a completely broken game mechanic which was never fixed for 10 years and then call it the ""DeFiNiTivE edItiOn"". Give me a break. Also, it's really a bad design choice to continue this poor retreat mechanic. Are you telling me that Napoleon wanted to retreat his army at some point and instead of telling his men to march backwards, they did a giant zig zag randomly past their own fortifications right into a nest of enemies?

And don't tell me, ""Oh... why don't you use mods?"" Because I swear i'll slap you.

Normally I don't hate on Total War games but this is the only option for a american revolutionary version. The others are great minus that ridiculous retreat tactic.

[b]TLDR[/b]: Game is a really good concept and is really fun at some points but is so unbelievably buggy and unfinished in so many areas that it’s actually just not playable in its state.

And to start Sega is an absolute scum company for multiple reasons so please don’t give money to them. They've re-released this 11 year old game with a new price tag and no changes.

I really don't understand Steam reviewers most of the time! I rekon the 88% of people who have reviewed this game positively either have a large chunk of their frontal lobe missing, review the game based on a third party mod that they've downloaded, or enjoy dribbling over the game because they're fulfilling they're fantasies of marching imperial western soldiers into North America or india and murdering axe wielding natives en masse with musket rifles and Puckle guns (Gatling guns)

This is the first time i'v sat and given a list of cons on a steam review and i'm going to keep it short because I don't want to feel like a complete A tier dweeb, I don't feel the need to list Pros here because you can go and look at positive reviews for that.

Let’s start with the blatant fact that this game was released after Sega acquired CA and it was released way before it was ready you can prove this because there is loads of interesting history content, there’s a tonne of unique units and a good variety of nations to play as so you can see while playing they were originally aiming quite high with this game (to a level of the amazing TW predecessors) but it’s completely and unbelievably buggy and unpolished and you can see this very quickly while playing. I’ll list some major problems below, 

The Campaign map is exactly what you expect from a total war except for the amount of regions in the game is a bit odd, for example France and Spain are single regions with Paris and Madrid being the only cities in them, the Campaign AI is completely irrational, alliances mean absolutely nothing except for maybe the ones you are preset with and if you play on normal difficulty it will be a breeze sweeping through and winning, if you go up a notch to hard difficulty every single nation will declare war with you you won’t be able to make any money from trading because you don’t have anyone to trade with and you can’t really repair relations because after they’ve declared war on you, you have around a -100 point diplomatic negative for “At War” which effects your ability to make peace.

You regularly play a game of cat and mouse on the campaign map where a small army will use its incredible move points to sneak past your armies into the back of your country and just walk around plundering towns and sieging cities (this was especially bad when playing as Russia)
You just don’t have the eco early game to combat this and even if you send an army to deal with it if you auto resolve the enemy army will just gain another shed load of movement points and retreat halfway across the map again, continuing the tedious chase.

Army’s can disembark from ships, move a good amount of distance from the shore and siege and win a city in one move, this can take you by surprise and is hard to combat because of the distance that navies can move in one turn as well. ( this is only really a problem when you turn the “see AI moves” off in the options and you will want to do this so the end turn doesn’t take 2 minutes every time you end turn while you watch an AI in another continent move its navy around)

The Battles in this game are mind numbing. The only battles I actually enjoyed were specifically defensive in a field with line infantry if you have anything more complex then that the bugs will just ruin the fun, here are some examples:
[list]
[*]When sieging a fort with a good amount of artillery the game will very regularly have a major lag problem in the two fast forward speeds, actually making them slower than the regular speed.
[*]Also when sieging a fort i’v regularly encountered a problem where i will ask a unit to climb up the walls and they will leave about 10 soldiers stuck at the bottom effectively rendering the unit useless, unusable and broken for the rest of the battle.
[*]Being on the defensive side of a siege battle, fort walls are completely unusable and broken, your men will just glitch all over the place will constantly end up getting stuck, not manning the parapets, the click and drag deployment is completely clunky, and because units have to completely form up to shoot you can deploy men facing the inside of the walls that will probably route the enemy before they can do anything useful on the walls, meaning its more effective to just not use the fort walls at all during a siege defence 
[*]Artillery units are completely broken, you can have a line of cannons that will fire a shotgun type cartridge that will just route 2 or three units of infantry that approach them each
[*]line infantry need every single soldier to completely form up in a line before they fire a single shot, this doesn’t seem too bad until either your unit has two or three men that glitch away from the main unit on top of the fact that your men will move with the urgency of a 80 year old disabled man, meaning that until you unlock the fire and advance tech you cannot win a 1 v 1 against and pre deployed line infantry
[*]Infantry reloading just takes the piss you can’t skirmish with infantry because they just can’t reload in time to fire and move before being charged, if you move them at all it will cancel any reload progress, and again the unit has to be completely formed up to even start reloading. 
[*] Cavalry have very limited use in my opinion they can be very effective when you micromanage repeatedly charging into infantry moving away and rinse and repeating, but again because of bugs sometimes your cavalry will just walk into men rather than charge, they can sometimes charge in single file for some reason, they get tired incredibly quickly, they absolutely can’t stand and fight in a melee, they have to charge to be effective. I charged the heaviest cavalry unit in the game (special horse guards) into a unit of ‘firelock armed infantry’ through a breech in a fort wall. The cavalry charged in a two man file, i left them in a melee and they killed about half the infantry before losing 80% of their men and routing.
[*]I had a fleet of about 13 / 14 ships including HMS Victory, three heavy first rates (the most powerful ships in the game) 5 First rates, and the rest Razee frigates that i auto resolved against a single pirate second rate ship. I lost three razzee’s and every ship became damaged. 
[*]And to finish the reason I uninstalled, I had a battle between my two armies and one enemy army. The battle was predicted as even but because Empire came before CA allowed you to have larger unit battles your second army will reinforce and fill up your first armies unit cap one unit at a time by marching individual units into the map. This time the game decided to spawn my reinforcing units outside the battle and march the men one by one into the map where they were sat getting cut down by the enemy cavalry and then routing before i even had control of them.

Campaigns are very fun to do, still on and off on my Prussian campaign over the last year or so and practically started WW1 200 years early = one great part of this game.

Wiped out the Austrians in a great final battle.

Multiplayer with friends is also pretty fun to do because it makes you think more tactically instead of just outmaneuvering the crummy ai and throwing your men in infinite human waves against the enemy .

Naval battles aren't really what I'm into but hey if you like that sort of stuff its there. The little rocket boats are good for suicidal charges against man'o'war ships.

Like Shogun 2 the campaign focuses on you just conquering and building up your imperial presence, so if you are comparing this to Napoleon and deciding which one to buy, I'd go for empire if you're into, you know.. being a hardcore imperialist, as Napoleons map is literally just Europe and focuses mainly on the same battles as Empire. So in summary of that, go for empire as it's just way more open-ended in what you can do and conquer.

55,72026586,english,"Empire: Total War was in development for around 5 years, and it shows in almost every aspect of its design.

To start with, it is an older game as of 2020. Yet despite that, it has a timeless aspect to it, similar to games like Doom or Quake. By that, I mean there's a level of polish that you don't normally see in RTS games.

Practically each and every faction has unique voice acting, Prussian units speak German, American units have Yankee accents, etc. Each faction also has a unique playstyle, doubly so for the Native American units.

I have a good deal of respect for the developers for including Native Americans in the game. They really took their time to balance out a faction that didn't have the same technology level as the European units. Native troops are deadly when compared to the Europeans in the game, but only when they can get in close.

The naval battles are there for those who want them, but I personally didn't enjoy the laggy combat and avoided engagements as a result.

Overall, I have spent most of my time in the Battle Simulator, running different combinations of units against each other. The rock, paper, scissors dynamic of infantry, cavalry, and cannon feels timeless. If I had to guess, the tactical decisions the player makes in this game are very close to those that historical generals had to make.

The campaign mode is fun, but I found that after a while it was very easy to build a death-stack of units and just roll over my AI opponents.  

The game has aged a bit (Don't run it above 1080p unless you want to squint reading the fonts) which actually has some benefits to it. These days, an above average PC can easily render the hundreds of units that can show up to each battle.

My friends of total war I and i'm sure all of you are sick and tired of the half-ass lame, non historical, content cutting company know as CA to see whats happening to this series is tragic to less and less content in the games, to ridiculous DLC payments that should already be in the game. Uk i remember back playing MTW2 preparing for battles the long and intense general speeches really pumped you up and got you ready for war. Unit cards had actual meaning behind them and gave you that feeling of the common man taking up arms to defend his country now all we get are little shadows of units. The little short movie clips when you sent in a spy gone. Avatar customization gone. Just so many things that were so good in the other total war games have been stripped. Now, idk about all of you but this bs were are being given with Troy having to wait a whole other year for it to be on steam and WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED TO THE HISTORY OF THESE GAMES. Listen there is nothing wrong with changing things up here and there and experimenting. I for one thought warhammmer was decent and they should of just left it at that. I feel like the spark and the fun that total war once was is slowly going away by every new release. I don't know why they don't to an EMPIRE 2 and actually put time and hard development in the game and also do Napoleon but not have it as a standalone game but like a campaign dlc pack that we have seen in Rome 2 and other newer total war games. I think that if they made another Empire/ Napoleon and add the features that have been stripped from over the years I think that could be CA's saving grace and we should get their attention because at the end of the day WE ARE THE BUYER and IM NOT WASTING MONEY ON CRAP feel free to give your thoughts on the path CA is going down",1593567959,1593567959,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198085202955,47,3,16263,1878,8772,1602038203

But... I had fun. 96 hours of it which I don't regret (my Mum does but she's always disappointed in me). The gameplay loop is dull and repetitive but somehow really has its moments. The campaign is essentially a steamroll through the moronic AI who couldn't lead an U6s football team let alone an 18th century expeditionary force, but there's quite a bit of satisfaction in doing so. The online and ship battles are probably the saving grace for most, being pretty damn fun when the servers aren't fulfilling their suicidal fantasies.

This game tried to do so much new and gets a bad rap in the Total War community because much like what my last girlfriend would say, it just didn't follow through. But also like my last girlfriend, if you ignore the mess of the overall body, there are some fun bits to play around with.

Would I recommend you pay for this game? NO! Christ no! Go outside or get a job or pay for something worth investing in like a PornHub Premium.

Maratha Confederacy is ex-treme-ly overpowered. In no world could them folks invade and assault via sea the Northern European countries at that time. They were barely surviving in India at that time. Totally biased. 

Also unexpected game crashes ruin your hours of time investments just to see your country not fully realised because of crashes when you click next turn.

Sometimes, the game 'thinks' too artificially in which all parties declare war and half of Europe is in war with each other or they don't make peace in the midst of losing everything.

Pity.

Like Rome 2 this suffered from a painfully bad launch but, the problems were fixed.  No factions were locked behind a pay wall and only 1 campaign and a few units were and all together you can pick this game up for 30 bucks or less with all dlc. It's really well worth it. It's a faithful and beautiful recreation of 1700s Europe, America, and India. This is the only total war game to date to include multiple map zones. It's a shame they didn't do it again. The mods for this game are great as well. You can roleplay a lot too. All though the minor nations are mostly copy paste, at least their colors are different. 

pros 
fun 
cheap 
good mods

14,69113939,english,"TL;DR Auto-battle doesn't work, making you fight EVERY battle, can be really tedious.

Honestly, play one of the other Total War games if you want to play a Campaign...the auto-resolve in this one is absolutely positively effed. In my experience it works better in Shogun 2 or the Warhammer ones (unless you play as Skaven). As much as I loved the first Rome: Total War it was pretty borked in that one too.

You will have to fight EVERY SINGLE BATTLE manually if you don't want to inexplicably lose when you outnumber the enemy four to one. It's tedious. 

When you clearly have the advantage it's just a waste of the player's time. I remember having this issue with over ten years ago when I bought it and having tried it again recently I can see that this is still the case. The issue applies to Naval battles, Sieges, Regular Battles you name it.

Egregious example: A single regiment of Line Infantry would NOT win against 3 regiments of Militiamen and a regiment of Minutemen even despite the Line Infantry's stat advantage.

Just imagining how the disciplined soldiers march into the battlefield facing unpredictable death from muskets and canons is really captivating. Warfare has really changed after the practical use of gunpowder, it seemed to have removed the romanticized picture of battle, as an individual line soldier they barely have much control in the fight other than reloading as fast as possible and hope you hit the target and hope he doesn't hit you.

The music in this game is really good, I always find myself enjoying the loading screens because of the soundtracks, IMO it's one of the most beautiful OSTs in the franchise. The gameplay is not perfect as many people have mentioned, it has it's flaws and the AI may play odd sometimes but I still had a lot of fun with this.

41,67254184,english,"Empire Total war is a decently priced game that is good, but flawed.
First of all, you do not need DarthMod to have a good time.

Trading is short but sweet, simple to learn, and entertaining to master.

Combat feels epic, strategy creates a skill gap that satisfies you, and makes you feel as if you are one of the greatest generals.

Siege battles are to be avoided, glitchy, boring, overall bad.

Navy combat is confusing and hard to control. This is the first game to fully implement this feature though, there are stepping stones.

Artillery is just right, not being overpowered or underpowered. It can give a strategical defense, but if exposed, can be a waste and a huge loss.

Calvary and skirmishers are cool to use and give you an extra sense of strategy and an edge over your opponent.

Graphics, although not as good as the new games. In my opinion, are excellent. The game does not lag even though there are hundreds or even thousands of bodies everywhere.

However, I feel as if punishment is too severe. One volley should not massacre enemy units. Armies should not leave battle as if they were defeated completely. Wars are fought by attrition and manpower, not by one battle to see who can massacre another army quicker and leave the enemy capital exposed. This does though give an advantage to mobilizing which, again. General, epic.

Hope you enjoyed the review as I have edited this and made sure it was full of my opinion on this game.

Historically built fortresses and location wold be a good start, better AI (which was so repetitive), better colony and trade route management. To all fellow Total War fans our there this is a no go. I bought this title for a few pounds years after its release due to curiousness, but it is not work a penny. Stick to Medieval II and Shogun II, which to the contrary are titles with much more depth, design & game play.",1588172138,1588172138,False,1,0,0.458799570798873901,0,True,False,False,76561198158168439,42,4,5077,0,4393,1598981058
25,68225153,english,"Well, I'll be honest. This is probably the first (and hopefully the last) game I've bought on steam that I felt the need to refund shortly after trying it out. Now, I'm not a complete stranger to the Total War franchise. I've got a relatively old disc-copy of Medieval 2 with the Kingdoms expansion, and recently took advantage of Shogun 2 being given away for free (while also buying a bit of DLC to complete the experience).

Maybe I was a bit biased after experiencing the two aforementioned games, but my first hour of Empire was... bizarre. The UI makes a rather sharp divergence in terms of infantry control--which, by the way, seemed to not want to cooperate with my attempts to form firing lines that AREN'T at weird angles--and the introductory campaign... well... Look, I understand that it's meant to ease you into things, but each battle ended up turning into an overly-long wait time for the troops to line up and fire. They don't even fire in ranks, either--no, apparently you don't get that yet. Thus my foray into having to micro-manage a bunch of different groups of soldiers with (seemingly) wonky control systems across the battlefield began.

I suppose what bugged me the most was how... boring everything felt. Maybe it's the comparative lack of melee units smashing into each-other. Maybe I just had the wrong set of expectations because of previous experiences. Take it with a grain of salt if you will, but I just can't recommend the game after such a lousy first impression.

Hell, if you want some good and fun line-battle action, go get Fall of the Samurai.

30,68172766,english,"Empire is by far my most favorite Total War game, with only Napoleon a close second. My reason for my love of the game is it's setting, this time period is my most favorite in world history. I think I love this game the most though because of it's trading system, I love to expand trade and fight over the most profitable resources, I love to send ships to South America to get one over on the enemy. The factions are fantastic choices, my favorites being the US, United Provinces, France, and Sweden. The graphics were great for it's time, and the combat gameplay is very good. The musket combat is so satisfying watch and hear, I love to send rangers to snipe the enemy general and cause his troops to panic.

The game is not without issues, but they are quite small in my opinion.

The US should just be a faction you can start playing as, not only unlockable at the end of a story mode which honestly isn't that great.

While I am perfectly fine with the size of the map, I do wish it was a little bigger over in Europe. Even North America could have have more regions to take, there is an entire empty area in the midwest that you can't do anything with, not even build a city. And they are missing major cities like New York City, which is weird because it was a major area of fighting during the various wars. It's missing a few other states I would of liked to see, like the Vermont Republic (who was it's own country for a little while) and maybe Trenton, New Jersey, which saw a lot of combat.

I'm not fond of the fort sieges, I don't think most people are. They're kinda boring...

Sometimes the AI's pointer for shooting is behind them even though I told them to attack in front of them. It doesn't always happen but in order to fix it just keep double clicking and it will fix.

So yeah those are my issues, they aren't a big deal to me, and a lot of fixed with mods. In fact this game has fantastic mods I suggest. I personally use Empires of Destiny which is a bunch of mods put together in a pack.

Empire Total War

Pros-

#1.Good graphics

#2.My speakers sound like they will explode from the cannons

#3.It is cool to fight as USA.I'm American

#4.It takes real strategy to manage money in the game on the harder difficulty settings

#5.I like that time in history

#6.Native Americans

#7.The naval battles look cool

#8. Mass murder of the enemy who has been pissing you off is a delight

#9.Multiplayer is in this game but I have not tried it yet

Cons-

#1.The enemy AI is really stupid in battles.They will fire cannons at their own men trying to kill you.I was in a battle today and the enemy killed their own general with a cannon and he was 2 or 3 feet in front of the cannon when they fired it.They will also fire cannons at the bottom of a hill and hit the top of the hill over and over and do no damage to you at all

#2.Your soldiers will shoot and kill their own countrymen in fire at will mode.They are bots and do not think.If you have tired soldiers falling back they will get shot by your own men even if they are 3 feet in front of the fire at will soldiers who are shooting at the enemy at the most far point of their range.

#3.When your soldiers enter buildings in battles it is awkward and is really slow

#4.There is a bug when soldiers die sometimes half of their body might disappear into the ground.It just doesn't look realistic

#5.The other countries have no personality.When I am doing trade talks it feels like I'm negotiating with the same bot mind every time

#6.The AI of your opponents knows which of your cities/towns have little to no defense without having a spy or anyone anywhere near it.This is sadly an issue for most total war games.What I mean is they will declare war on you and attack you if you are weak at one city but with no way of knowing that.It would be like I went to rob your house and I knew when you were leaving and I knew where and how to disable the alarm without anyone telling me and without ever seeing your house before.You could call it more of a challenge but I think it sucks.It is really expensive having enough soldiers to defend against a full army who don't fight.Even when you are at war already the enemy knows which of your cities are the weakest magically

#7.The navy AI is stupid.It is not realistic

#8.If your soldiers are attacked at one end of the line in melee the rest at the other end will do nothing even if there is no one near them for melee and enemy soldiers are in range to be shot.They have to wait for the enemy who is in melee combat with the other end of the line to finish before they do anything.In this example they can be in fire at will mode the entire time.I'm talking about the same squad of soldiers together

The Bottom Line -

There was some cool and fun stuff to be found with Empire and I do not regret buying it.It takes games like this to point the video game industry in the right direction.I can't wait to see this same type of game remade in 2029.

I would recommend this game to casual military strategy fans only.

If you are looking for a realistic game than this is not it but it is still fun to play.

Computer AI is not the best, also it is frustrating when you defeat an army, it scurries away - you have to keep chasing it and defeating it over and over again. 

Also, if you have say a Four star general, five cannons, six infantry units, four horse units basically a good sized army - but you face some broken rebel army of barely four units. If you auto battle it, you'll lose a large amount of men - it's silly, very silly indeed. So, sometimes it is best to fight the battle, even though you have an enormous force, versus a couple of camels and some peasantry with muskets. 

Diplomacy is not great - I had Austria repeatedly demanding I give them vast territory for nothing more than a trade agreement.

99,67477431,english,"It's morning, the morning of your regiment's first battle.  Last night's fog slowly lifts, revealing a sprawling verdant plain.  In the distance, you catch a glimpse of the sun reflecting off something.  It's a sword blade, held high by an enemy officer.  With a smooth, practiced motion, he slices it downward, and lines of infantry appear, marching over the crest of the hill, their muskets tipped with gleaming bayonets.  You're nervous, so are your comrades.  You can hear the sergeant in the back reassure some of the men.  You take a breath and steady your nerves, for whether this day ends in bloody defeat or glorious victory, you will have done your part for your family, for your people, for your empire.

Like the rest of the Total War franchise, Empire is played from a macro perspective; you control a nation as it enters the early days of the 18th century.  You decide what will be built, how resources are traded, and if need be, how to wage war.

Empire Total War can be played multiple ways.  First, you have the ubiquitous Grand Campaign, which sees you select a nation to play as and lead to victory.  The goals are fairly simple: depending on what mode you picked, you'll be tasked with capturing a set number of regions.  Some of these regions will be determined by who you play as.  For instance, while playing as Russia, you have to have Moscow among your holdings to be victorious.

Capturing a region is fairly straightforward.  Simply capture the region capital, either by a swift decisive action, or a long strategic siege, and the entire region is yours.  You can decide what will be built in the city itself and the various towns that dot the map.

Cities come with a handful of build slots, each related to certain types of buildings.  The administrative building for instance can be upgraded from magistrate to governor’s residence, and later you will have the choice to turn in into a military governor’s barracks which grants stronger units or the more economically advantageous government council.  Most of the time, the choice is whether to spend treasury on upgrading a building or not.

Any empire worth its salt needs a strong army to back it up, and you have a fairly wide selection of what troops to recruit.  The time period the game takes place saw soldiers armed with muskets line up in tight formations, firing at once in the hopes of hitting something.  This line infantry will no doubt make up the bulk of your army, but be sure to support them with every general’s favorite new toy: cannons!  These beasts can bombard enemy forces at range, and with any luck, you might actually hit some of them.  Their true power becomes apparent when directed at fort walls or at close range with cannister shot.

Don’t forget to defend your flanks, either.  An assortment of cavalry will do you some good, as these fast moving units can harass enemies, or break a formation with a well-timed charge.  Various light infantry units available highlight the shift in warfare happening at the time.  Some units can hide in dense woods or employ skirmishing tactics, like the rangers.  While they are fun to use and quite effective at flanking the enemy, they won’t last long under concentrated fire, so be sure to maneuver them to maximize their effectiveness.

Now let’s get on to the reason you had your eye on this game in the first place: the battles.  Despite all the economics, diplomacy and research you can direct your attention to, Empire Total War is – at its heart – an RTS.  Before a battle starts you will have an opportunity to array your units how you want with a certain highlighted area of the map.  During this time, you won’t be able to see how your enemy’s forces are arrayed, so remain flexible.

These encounters can range from a force of 100 vs 100, or one of well over a thousand taking on a similarly sized foe.  Order units is as simple as selecting them and using the right mouse button to direct them somewhere on the battlefield.  By hold down the mouse button and dragging, you can further dictate how many ranks they form in, that is, how many lines of men they will stand in.  The preferred method at the time was three ranks, but as commander, you may find an unorthodox approach may serve better to win the day.  With 20 units taking position, it may be confusing how your formations will look once they get into position.  By holding the space bar, helpful green dots will show where your troops will be once the reach their destination.

Be sure to zoom in on your units, as they are all very well detailed.  It’s entertaining to watch an officer draw his pistol while his men hurriedly reload their weapons.  The sound design deserves special mention her as well.  The crash of a musket volley and the cries of men charging into the fray add to the excitement of the battles.

Empire adds a new front to the struggle for world domination: naval battles.  While naval combat in this game has been praised quite a bit, I find them slow and unintuitive.  Ships have a hard time maneuvering around the enemy and never go quite where you want them to.  Fortunately, the game comes with an auto-resolve button that allows a battle to be carried out, whether on land or sea, without your direct control.  I usually only use it for naval engagements as I can’t stand them.

In addition to the Grand Campaign, Empire Total War offers a story mode, in which you fight your way across our nation’s earliest engagements.  The first missions teach the basics of combat and nation management, so I’d recommend trying this mode first.  You take command of regiments made up of early settlers, and later fight under the crown in the French-Indian War.  Then, you lead America in its struggle for independence and securing its place in the rapidly growing world.

Empire Total War has provided me with hours of enjoyment.  I could tell stories for days about how sixty ranger held off an entire French army, or how British held fort deep in enemy territory fought off wave after wave of assaults.  Massive armies clashing on damp plains, cavalry charging across a bridge in the nick of time, but I won’t subject you to those now.  Instead, I encourage you to give this game a shot and comment with some of your own exploits.  I tried to included everything I would look for in a game, but feel free to add anything I missed or what you thought of Empire Total War.",1587106185,1587106185,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198307346268,57,3,9606,0,8961,1598142407

10,67318036,english,"While I love it, it must be said. This game is absolute trash. It's an unfinished beta of a game that wanted to be too much, in a time when development was harsh and unforgiving, under the direction of a new publisher that most likely moved all of the staff from Australia to Britain, cancelling a great deal of what was being prepared in the meantime, reorganizing personnel hastly and \ or with terrible timing and awful decision making.
While at its core Creative Assembly was still MTW2's old crew, many - including the battle mechanics programmer - went away mid development. This disorganization coupled with absurdly placed goals and SEGA's demands, created the perfect storm. Empire Total War is the result of a small studio being acquired by a greater entity and put on a forced march towards glory; they needed to literally touch the Sun, and just like Icarus, they failed and landed on their head back to Earth.

Up until mid 2011 - release was March 2009 - the game was borderline unplayable. For well over 2 years musketeers wheeling into the foreground with no AI, terrible campaign crashes, endless loading times, and a plethora of bugs and glitches made the experience awful. But the scope and the novelty of such an endeavour still attracted masses of casuals and the most hardcore groups of exploiters went on to form elite squads of competitive ETW gamers. I was in one too at the time, an international competitive group with a strong German presence. For almost 3 years we got together every week to ruin everyone's fun because winning in this game was - and still is - totally based on exploits. Units have godawful balancing, the speed and impact of all cavalry is all over the place; you can place 2 rows of light cavalrymen behind your infantry and have 3 volleys of instant fire that WILL destroy any unit present beside Guards. If you were a newbie, or even an intermediate player, you'd be completely screwed in a competitive setting, and even at a casual level, the amount of exploits was so atrocious you'd be a winner even in a 2 v 1 secnario just because you'd be making  a 10 Guards 10 Artillery army and flood people with mortar fire. Ragequitting was the norm for everyone. Netcode has always been awful to the core. The few people that still play it in MP know every nook and cranny and can destroy anybody with a thought because all of these incredibly frustrating balancing choices are still there.

The SP side isnt any better tho. AI is an absolute mess of convoluted nonsense. Coding and optimization of the campaign map and battle maps is so bad that it hurts even modern PCs. 
MP campaign was in development and testing phase but again, since this mess of a game came out rushing in through the door with at least 1 year of development left in the dumpster, the few lucky ones able to actually play any game got crashes upon crashes and loading a saved game even with perfect syncing would result in freezes as soon as you'd press the end turn button.
There is STILL an unavoidable, random crash in the Ottoman's turn after 11 years. Never patched, never fixed. The last patch they applied in 2011, while stabilizing the game a bit, completely destroyed the first person camera's coding. You cannot view the bullet trajectory anymore, not from muskets nor from cannons. The game just freezes mid-air.
Switzerland was planned and half finished in the code, but you cant enable it back. Pieces of development tools never given to the public were also half finished and thrown in the dumpster, waiting to be released only in late 2012 for Shogun 2.

I spent an ungodly amount of hours playing this game. I enjoyed it, but I wouldnt recommend it to anyone. It was amazing the first time I put my eyes on it back in 2009, and the few years I went nuts with all the exploits and a crew of dedicated companions to fight with. But now.... no, absolutely not. This game has been abandoned and left in a sorry state for a decade, the only thing keeping it somewhat alive are mods, and even those cant pull its butt up from the ground. There's no sendoff, no fanfare, and there never will be. The creators didnt love their baby enough, and put their necks on a yoke in servitude of SEGA's ambitions. There is no pity, nor remorse in here. Naiveté got their hands in the dirt. Few years later, with Rome 2, they'd prove themselves to be in the same situation.

* naval combat is absolutely miserable slow motion micromanagement to even get your ships point the their guns the right way - and you can't avoid it as naval trade is the only way to have any kind of economy
* diplomacy is idiotic, especially on hard / very hard - everybody will always declare war on you all the time
* land battles are fun most of the time, but they can easily turn into an hour long slog while both armies stand still or very slowly walk around while the artillery shoots. And balance is really out of whack - cavalry is useless,  fancy unit types are useless, canister shot does all the killing, infantry just protects your canister shot artillery. This is especially true on hard / very hard.
* everything is so finicky, like often your artillery won't even shoot because of some microscopic difference in elevation you didn't even notice, so you spend next 10 minutes of your life repositioning before the battle can actually start
* there's a million bugs and exploits, and you're often forced to use them because base game is just too painful otherwise.

Overall it's totally playable, with mods (I mean I sure as hell played it tons), but it was definitely the weak point of Total War series, and it would be wrong to recommend it.

Total War Empire is one of the masterpiece games that delivers long term playability without sacrificing short term enjoyment, a difficult balance to achieve for most game makers these days. You can be in command of an epic battle every few minutes, keeping the adrenaline up, while taking dozens of hours to beat a campaign (my current campaign has been 63 hours and I still have an hour or two left until victory).

I will admit, there are bugs, to be honest I've never played a game that was perfect UNLESS it was an extremely boring and short game. Besides the bugs are tolerable, you learn to work with the few quirky ways units behave in forts, and the game auto-saves every turn, so a crash only ever sets you back a few minutes, and the crashes are very rare.

One final con for this game: you can't play all factions, to be honest, there are A LOT, and for balancing purposes and also due to the richness of the game (each faction has it's own special units that are historically accurate), I wager playing as something other than one of the 10 ish factions you get to choose from just wasn't financially possible, or else would have take an extra few years of development.

54,65567768,english,"When Empire: Total War was released, I purchased it immediately and then found out about how it required an internet connection after I got home. So I sat it down on my desk and it gained dust. When I bought it on Steam, I was excited to play and see how it went. I was not a fan. American History, especially Colonial Era, is a passion of mine. I felt that they did it justice in that sense, but when it came to the brutality I came to expect in a Total War title, I was very unhappy. Just a few cannons decimate an army and send them routing. Fort battles are practically impossible, you can't scale the walls without your men routing after fighting on top on them. You either blow open the gate and storm in or blow up the walls and storm in. The days of siege battles had ended in my opinion. In terms of fighting to the last man like you could see in earlier titles, units choose to flee the battlefield instead of hunkering down and staying strong. Morale is a joke, it depletes so quickly it doesn't really exist. Instead of having many options on how to fight an enemy, it feels as though the game wants you to fight in certain ways, or always lose. Does the enemy have cannons? Use cavalry to attack them or lose. Does the enemy have cavalry? Better shoot them with infantry quick. Do they have infantry? Figure it out or lose. The battles become less about military size and more about unit diversity. Which is an okay thing, but don't make it necessary to win. If I want to have an army only comprising infantry, they would overwhelm defenders of a fort, or an artillery brigade after getting close enough. If you loved the older Total War titles, this is different and should be approached with a small amount of skepticism.

14,30959716,english,"Play Medieval 2 Total War with Stainless Steel mod for a better game and a better game experience.

This is just a mess, even with Darthmod its absolutely awful. The difficulty is more retarded than everything, if you put it too low it becomes boring and if you put it too high everyone hates you and wars you in 10 turns literally. Pretty historical, im sure. Also they still give you their shitty trades like demanding half my empire for some tiny garbage place.

I played as Prussia, I did nothing but existed. in 2 Turns Poland warred me. Turn 3 Austria did too. Turn 5 Hannover warred me, turn 8 Britain, France, United Provinces, some small countries arround me all warred me within the same turn despite that I had very positive relations with some of them. As you see nothing works, its just fake. I did not had a single offensive war yet the whole world wants to kill you and if you have good relations and spend time and money for that? Yeah that wont matter.

So yeah, the campaign AI and such feels like absolute and non-historical trash so enjoy having no immersion at all.

About the battles...garbage. The issue is that basically with Empire they introduced a new engine. Its also the downfall of Empire and literally any TW that comes after it, Rome 2 was also such a absolutely horrible game because of it. Why? Well because the engine has NO unit collision at all and only killmoves so enjoy seeing 1v1s all the time as your guys are glitching arround the battlefield as soon as they go into meele against someone, so much fun. The only thing the engine does is simulating projectiles well but everything else feels garbage. Even how your army reacts in battle seems totally stupid, it has a rather static and buggy feeling and the meele feels like im watching trucks driving against another and pushing themselves somewhere literally.

As much as I love the improvement on the campaign map about managing your empire and such and the way trade works  I want to recommend it but all the points above + a few downsides (agents autospawning, thanks game for giving me stuff on parts where they are not needed) is just too much. Nothing is fun anymore about it, the campaign AI feels retarded, they cheat, the battles are absolutely dumb and dont feel like a simulation at all even with mod unless you really go full ranged vs full ranged.

My recommendation: 

Avoid this or grab it on a cheap sale and be prepared for seeing some small improvements at the cost of big dissapointments. Grab Medieval 2 Total War instead, it does everything far better and with certain mods like Stainless Steel the AI wont cheat and behaves incredibly well while the battles are also well done and the whole thing does not feel too old or graphically bad either.",1491394159,1583743963,False,3,0,0.462106704711914063,0,True,False,False,76561198028817463,430,117,9606,0,7905,1583848059

16,64372834,english,"Empire is that Total War game you go back to because there are non others set in this exact time period. While Fall of the Samurai expanded and made this concept of line infantry tactics work, it was constricted by the incredibly limited Japan map, to which Empire has the whole European front, the Americas and India to take over.
.
Of course, the way I describe this makes it sound like one of the best Total Wars to grab on steam. Well, in normal cases you'd be right, but CA is not normal. Nor is the corporate goliath behind them, SEGA.
.
This game suffers from a wide arrange of problems. Such as the AI not fighting according to the tactics that the period demands. They initially just like to bayonet charge by default, and enemy artillery tends to get stuck on open terrain, as laughable as that sounds. Not to mention that your own armies have issues of their own, such as not firing when their supposed to. Or taking too long to get in formation. And don't get me started on the seiges, if you think the AI sounds bad enough on land battles, then seiges will be like swimming up shit creek with your bare hands.
.
Grand Campaign is lacking severely, with rebellions easy to quell, broken economy, and only a semi decent technology tree (I'll give it a pass since Empire is the first gave to have a tech tree in the first place)
.
The thing I enjoy about the tech tree is how it upgrades your basic units to perform better on the battlefield. Something that Warhammer adopts to great effect. 
Sound design is severely lacking, with muskets sounding like cap guns, and artillery having a fwomp sound instead of the deadly thunderous noise it tends to have in real life. It sounds less like a war, and more of a reenactment. The music is dull, composed by Richard Beddow instead of Jeff Van Dyck.
.
Beddow's music is great, as he captures the feeling and spirit of the time periods and did fantastic work on the Warhammer games. While not as intense as Jeff Van Dyck's use of drums and vocals, it still captures that Total War feeling. In this game, not so much. I don't feel a whole lot of intensity during battles, they feel like they should be a spectacle instead of an intense game of strategic planning. Needless to say, this is not his best work. After the first time you hear it, it tends to annoy you to the point that you mute the music and find solace in only the sounds of war. Which is just to my liking for games like this.
So why am I recommending this? And why do I have so many hours logged into it?
Because the game can be incredibly fun and immersive if you have the know-how to mod it to your liking. 
.
Darthmod fixes the numerous issues in the campaign map, whilst making fighting against the ai a bit more bearable. However as famous as it is, it's not enough to truly itch my historical sense.
.
That's where I recommend a mod called Imperial Destroyer
This mod retextures units, overhauls the sounds so that muskets and artillery actually sound like a wall of death, and massivly fixes the ai to actually utilize it's intended purpose of standing in a line and using mass volleys against you. Even seiges are more bearable to fight, and the mod has an option to remove fortresses all together. Rebellions are a lot easier to start, and income for your armies are a luxury. 
.
To describe in my best words how much this mod made me feel historically immersed. 
I found the 7 years war much earlier than should historically happen. The war, much like in history, drained my treasury upon my victory and long fought struggle, and I was forced to increase taxation in the colonies (which the mod just gives you control of right from the start) and it caused a rebellion to stir in Boston, which was the United States emergent faction. They pushed me out of the thirteen colonies and I was forced to watch history repeat itself as I brought my colonial troops overseas to help fight the french, who were gearing up to invade london. 
.
This historically accurate scenario was completely unscripted and gave me a feeling of immersion that the base game could never provide.
I'll be linking the mod here
https://www.twcenter.net/forums/forumdisplay.php?1930-Imperial-Destroyer
So now for my final verdict
.
I give Empire Total War a 6/10 for the vanilla experience
It's lacking in so many good features, but just innovative enough to not be the worst
Modded with Darthmod, I give it a 7/10
For fixing most of the issues, but still retaining that vanilla feel
Modded with Imperial Destroyer, I give it a 9/10
For not only fixing a lot of the core issues I had with it to begin with, but providing a completely Total War experience that should have been from the original game devs",1583089271,1583667774,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198086065918,403,7,26125,0,25894,1583668136

On the strategic level I don't think any of the designers ever heard of Jomini or Clausiwitz and the result is juvenile play on the part of the AI.  At the tactical level, in the battle simulator, the AI operates its units beyond their capabilitites in order to compensate for the lack of effective tactics, such as faster unit movements, undocumented formations, and enduring casualty rates of 75% before breaking.  Although you can issue orders to your units, the AI constantly interprets them so as to inflict more damage upon yourself than to the enemy, particularly with artillery.  You have no control over when or if your units will fire.  The AI controlled units usually get in the first volley even if you are waiting in a defensive position.  The AI units fire from beyond their effective ranges.  Instead of using the unit flag (center of the line) as an aim point for artillery the right flank is used causing most shots to miss.  The AI use of cavalry is particularly frustrating, frontal charges on artillery supported by infantry where the unit takes 90% casualties and a the routed remainder still manage to make contact and rout your artillery.  On the other hand, if your cavalry charges the AI artillery it stops your unit in its tracks and stands and fights like Spartans, inflicting heavy casualties on your unit and not routing.  The battle simulator itself is not bad, if the designers could improve the way the AI manages its units instead of allowing it do ridiculous things then it would be a good product.

The ingenuity of having multiple theatres of war change the DNA of Total War in respect of replayability and strategic breadth.

Trade and diplomacy are vital, as upkeep costs are well balanced to ensure the game doesn't turn into a complete and utter steamroll after the first 50 turns as with many other TW titles.

So much fun stuff to do: invade towns, defend hills, have glorious artillery battles, lay siege to forts, storm the governor's palace in an Indian territory, -and- have crazy naval battles, a nice touch to round out what is honestly the best RTS title I've ever played.
When you slow the battle to 1/4 speed, and spread your rifles out along a fence, and form a phalanx of cavalry around your field guns, you'll feel the tension of waiting for the enemy to advance and enjoy that moment when you give the order to fire at will.
There will be some amazing moments as you repel charges, rout an advancing unit and cause panic with concentrated fire, start a skirmish at one end of a fort while running your melee units over the wall at the other side, realize with horror that your last unit will be shredded by canister shot as it valiantly advances on the remaining battery, etc etc.

Many people familiar with the franchise considers this to be one of the worst Total War games, and they might very well be right... But it is still a very fun game, after all, Total War games are in general very good, and even (some) of the worst of them are still good.

It is true that it is extremely buggy, perhaps because the developers got too ambitious, and perhaps because this game was made in an all new engine, so quicksaving is certainly a necessity, but the game is absolutely still playable (mostly).

75,59472490,english,"By far and away my favorite total war. 

Aside from steam, I played an easy 1000 hours on the CD when this first came out, and enjoyed every moment. Great replay value, even for the same factions. I must have played as every faction at least four times, and always had a radically different game. 

The campaign map is a marvelous progression from Medieval II. A huge map covering Europe and North Africa, the Middle East, India, North America, Central America, and the North of South America. There are also Four sea regions that have Trade Nodes. Brazil, Ivory coast. Strait of Madagascar, and the East Indies. Stretching across the globe, this gives you a true sense of world empire. 

The Combat is why I love this game. The ability to move any number of troops without generals in this age of warfare is perfect. You can run lightning raids and use several small detachments to hold strategic areas on the campaign map and harass larger forces.  My personal favorite is to have an all cavalry force supported by light cavalry artillery to scout ahead of the main body of infantry. ""Buford at Gettysburg cough cough!"" The Battle maps are large enough for maneuvers, and the terrain must be used to your advantage. A well placed regiment of good line infantry can turn an entire battle, or lose it. 

The AI is well, total war AI. Its either very dumb or you suspect it cheats somehow.  All and all for me it doesn't effect the fun of the game whatsoever. 

I highly recommend you grab this even if it goes back to $59.99 (It really shouldn't), but its worth the money especially if you are a fan of total War, The Age of Enlightenment, American Revolution (Great DLC by the way), and having fun sailing around with a frigate like Jack Aubrey.

Positives:
- The game offers a vast array of things to do. The multiple areas that you can focus on make the game take a while to complete with any nation. 
- trade doesn't have to be just between nations. Sending trading ships to the different areas also allows you to send profit back directly to your nation. 
- It isn't just about getting the biggest ships but instead having a nice mix of different ships for different parts of the battle.

Negatives:
- Artillery feels useless and the maps don't have a lot of hilly areas that allow you to use them from behind the infantry without the risk of hitting your own troops
- Adding on to the artillery, if you go into a battle, the artillery will have minimal kills at best because of overall poor accuracy but when auto-resolving the battles, they make it seem like artillery is key. 
- I got spoiled a bit with Total War: Shogun 2... having naval artillery in a battle would be quite nice in this game",1573569651,1573569651,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198272834348,46,15,22200,0,10697,1599790029

It offers almost endless replayability, with or without mods which have to be manually installed :( , and has a unique place among the Total War series with its combination of gunpowder weapons, naval combat, and trans-continental scale. The primary draws of Empire Total War (ETW for short) are the scale (most of the globe) and the period (18th Century). ETW has the distinction, for better and worse, among the Total War titles of being the first to feature playable naval combat and remains the only title where naval combat is heavily affected by prevailing winds. Given the vast expanses of the globe to trade with and/or conquer, naval strength becomes as important to the game as it was in the period - to a degree that no other TW title can match. The vanilla game did have its issues, primarily with campaign and battle AI that are the usual bane of all TW titles- it's difficult to get an AI to respond both logically (to its advantage) and in character (keeping with the historical/fantasy 'role' of the faction).

For example: England has always been keen on preserving the balance of power in Europe, right? Well, they were also keen on fighting the French a lot as well. However, the two would be allies when the circumstances dictated it. In the game, England and France go to war really early and fight each other into the ground. Meanwhile you'll have Poland, Prussia, Sweden and sometimes even Austria gobbling up all of Europe while they do nothing about it and keep destroying all of each other's armies. Diplomacy also lacks the ""liberate"" option that Napoleon and other titles after had. So your ally was just destroyed and you successfully drive the enemy from their territory? Tough, the only thing to do is to leave their capital undefended until a rebellion starts and they get their capital back. Sucks though because then they'll be at war with you after. Those are my only real gripes with the game. The at times horrible diplomacy and the lack of unit variety. Other than that, I've had loads of fun playing the game and would definitely recommend it to others!

I Definitely recommend buying this game even at full price ten years later still a great game, the steam version is definitive version which seems to contain alot of add ons that folks used to have to pay for.    Only problems with the game are my nvidia driver on exit of the game has about a 50% chance of going black an requiring reboot, only other problem is after saving many times it increases the save game load time an I have to goto C:\Users\name\AppData\Roaming\The Creative Assembly\Empire\save_games etc to find the save file folder an delete them quickly sort of bizzar that it saves the games under hidden folders. There are some mods that unlock alot of options as well available online but not through steam.   

I really wish total war would make an earth scale game with all nations, its bizzar that games like eu4 has a player made mods which recreates the whole earth all the nations on it for thousands of years etc but big game companies like eu's an empire total war empire an even civilization 6 didnt have an earth map on release really bizzar why the big game companies cant manage to do it on their own.",1573006475,1573006475,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198007659973,56,7,134148,1644,123738,1602066922

Every game you play is different and very intresting, sometimes i see Prussia and has full on conquested russia, and other times Prussia gets steamrolled by Poland. Or one time i had a minor nation on its own take 4 territories. 

However, this game is one of the roots people people's hatred for CA and SEGA. The game is glitchy, unit navigation is terrible, the Warpath DLC is completly unfinished and so are other parts of the game, and the war for independace campaign is pretty innacurate, but still fun.

This game is 100% better with Darthmod, a mod for the game that fixes a bunch of stuff, and makes the graphics way cooler. (along with making battles way more fun), but even Darthmod is old and combined with the game it makes for an annoying experience when you get a glitch that you know will never be fixed. (for example the only audio i get during battles is the same song over and over, with no sound from the actual fighting)



All in all this is still one of my favorite games, and people still p[lay it and while the mulitplayer was completly abandoned people still like to discuss things on steam.

If we could a game where it covers the same amount of land that empire total war with the same in depth number of cities and regions as Thrones of Brittanaia then i could see a very long lasting and challenging campaign with many factions and different cultures. I completely understand many faults with this idea including the problem that it would take ages to move your armies and fleets around the globe but i do sincerely believe that worked on properly this problem would be turned into a good thing, as if you play as a faction example Normans you would be quite used to nearby factions. but as you move you will see different types of cultures and so on and you may have the insight of what it may have been like for the people of the time to see these really different and interesting cultures.

The British have less artillery than the US, historically they had more and the   US has 16 x 24 lb guns where they had a 14 guns maximum of which the largest was a 6 lb. I suspect the moral of the US troops is higher as gunners charged downhill be cavalry in the flank managed to rout the cavalry. Similarly US rifleman who had no bayonets beat off cavalry when charged in the flank and routed them, something they patently couldn't have done.
The US artillery shoots across the map even when it cant see the enemy and chips away at the flank march which historically they weren't even aware of. The riflemen who were historically deployed on the opposite flank to the one the British flanking march took place on are now conveniently guarding the flank it did take place on. You could be forgiven for suspecting that the author of this travesty was an American trying to stack the odds in the Americans favour, but the AI is so stupid that its not that hard to win.

37,54784548,english,"While this title have good things, it really could be better. Overall it is fun if u can overlook the many mistakes it have. It completes an important objective which is to simulate a war on a believable way, within the limitations of money, resources, etc.
However there are various glitches or things that, in my opinion, could have been better, without the need of changing too much.

Single Player: To be honest I didnt play enough of mainstream campaing to be able to correctly judge, however I played way more of warpath campaing, so my point of view will be directed from that perspective.
The campaing is pretty much another total war, but with different time period. Naval battles are interesting, but I think game main difference with others is the fact battlefield is ruled by guns now. However on campaing map, it is a restricted version of the shinier Medieval TW, or so. Additionally, warpath is kinda shit, regrettably it is a low budget DLC, maybe they had to focus on doing less factions but more complete. You get very limited options, tech tree, and not even boats.

Multiplayer and BattleCamp: This is where I spend most of the time. I usually play native factions. And I see they could be improved very much with small changes. This applies to most factions, but natives even more. There are some regrettables mistakes that hurt realism a lot. Units are very few, skins repeat too much, units are too slow (i believe this could be easily be changed), they also very dumb, like VERY dumb. Additionally 50% of the units rooster is shit on MP. Maps are pretty, but unbalanced.

Overall, it is a game which I enjoyed a lot, mainly because is one of the only 2 total war where u get to play native americans. This game strong point is ofc time period. But if u want a version of this game which is literally better on everything u should look for Shogun 2.
If u really like the time period, you should try it. Otherwise there are way better total war (I only mean shogun 2)",1566666181,1566666181,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,76561198163240107,23,7,31599,0,28896,1583804592

I've only got 5 hours in this game so far but I think that's enough for me to decide I'm not interested in it.

This game is but a shadow of the splendour that is the Shogun variants of the Total War series.

I sieged a city filled with Frenchmen and natives, with a decently sized army that includes 3 artillery units.

My men march onto the city, knowing their duty. The music becomes more tense as we approach. My general inexplicably rushed the French general, who also happened to be rushing in the front lines. The first deaths of the battle are both generals.

OK, fair enough. I send 2 British units to flank some natives on the western side, sending the bulk of the army to the front of the fort to assault the rest. My artillery spreads out, firing upon the French... doing absolutely nothing despite direct hits. Speaking of doing nothing, the British sit there despite being ordered to attack, simply allowing the French to shoot their muskets. 

Not good. 80% of my army just routed. The French rush two of the artillery units, and the only infantry I have left are the 2 flanking units.

All of a sudden, every French and native man bolt out of that fort like kids leaving school. Quite confused, I say, ""What the fuck?""

Those French fools were all chasing the sole artillery unit that happened to be across the map, on the hill. I casually take both British units and occupy 2 buildings in town. The French immediately march back after they rout the artillery... only to enter the city individually.

Definitely has the the biggest map even compared to total war warhammer 2 because there is so much ocean in the mortal empires map and no sea combat. Really love the sea battles in this one it has kind of a steep learning curve but a lot of fun once you get used to how the boats operate the effectively. The land combat is really on point its never boring. Even the sieges are much better than most other total wars.

I bought it about 18 months after release, and at that point it was very stable and quite playable. It has the usual CA quirks regarding historical accuracy, but there are several mods that make the game more ""realistic"" if that is your thing. The modding community is fairly quiet these days, but Total War Heaven and total War Center are still the places to go for mods and advice.

I'm currently playing vanilla for the first time in years, and the balance is surprisingly good. The campaign stretches across 3 continents and 4 sea areas, and it a diverse mix of fighting on land, sieges, commerce raiding, fighting pirates, capturing islands, naval battles and world domination. 

For me the biggest change from the previous games was the diplomacy. Other nations actually hold to their alliances making if your reputation is good. The agents are useful without being overpowered and the usual civil war mechanic still exists in the game.

Set during the 1700s, you choose your army (British, French, American etc...) and try to conquer the world. Aspects of the game such as diplomacy and military movement are done in turn-based strategy style but the game switches to a real-time strategy style for the combat. Both land and naval forms of combat are fun to play and watching the battles unfold is truly spectacular. It is very difficult to learn all the aspects of the game quickly so I recommend starting the Road To Independence campaign as that almost serves as an extended tutorial. The graphics in this game are some of the best I have seen and the sound is fantastic too.

Empire: Total War is a brilliant strategy game that is definitely worth picking up. I selected this Total War game as my first one because I find the era particularly fascinating. I have since played some of Shogun 2 and the gameplay in that is also excellent so ultimately, you will be drawn to whichever game features the era you are most interested in.

As with any other ""Total War"" game, you're tasked with bringing a nation of your choosing to greatness and to expand said nation's rule and wealth, either through diplomacy, or through war. In this installment, you're playing in the 18th century.

Gameplay wise, the game is [strike]known[/strike] infamous for having dodgy programing and some major bugs/glitches (especially in the late game). Despite this, I believe that once you're skilled enough, you can achieve your campaign objectives before you encounter such issues. Both the campaign and battle HUDs are user-friendly and intuitive. My main issue with the game (other than the dodgy programing/bugs/glitches, of course), as with any other ""Total War"" game, is the fact that you only have a small selection of nations you can play as. Granted, this can be [strike]fixed[/strike] bodged with mods such as Empire Total Factions (which I have) or Darthmod, but I feel like this should be a part of the base game.

29,53088638,english,"This game is a good balance of tactical battle play and strategic territory play.

TLDR: A good game, plenty to keep you interested, but even the short campaigns are long (minimum 100 turns)

The game operates around two turns a year, with each power moving once per turn.

Conducting Battles

I particularly like the battle mechanics in this game.  When you opt to fight a battle yourself rather than use an 'auto resolve') you command your troops in units.  Each unit is typically 60 or 120 men and all are equipped with the same weapons and skills.  Given the period in history (from 1700) in the early game rate of fire and accuracy is low but improves slightly with new technology.  Units must be arranged carefully to support each other.  the AI performance varies so in some battles it's significantly more of a challenge to you than in others.  Some units have abilities that others don't and some can be more effective in certain situations.  For example Line Infantry can learn how to 'form square' making them much mire resistant to cavalry but Light Infantry can't.

There can only be 20 units from each side in the battle at a time, but if you there are additional armies nearby they can join the battle (they will march in from one edge).  Even small numbers of units can cope with an enemy with significant reinforcements if they are prepared for them as they enter the battle one unit at a time, typically away from the bulk of their forces.

The more experienced troops are the better their performance, including morale.  Also units can be replenished after a battle (unlike in Medieval Total War) allowing you to build up an army of experienced battle hardened veterans.

Naval Battles are also present in this game, and are quite tricky (at least for me),

Managing Territory

There are the usual empire management mechanics of managing resources, keeping the people happy (both the working classes and the wealthy classes) and researching technologies.  Religion also plays a part with determining how happy your subjects are, you can support your Empire's religion by building religious buildings which in turn produce religious agents (teachers) who can boost their (your) religion in territories they are placed in.

Trade also plays a significant part of the management as you can bring in significant amounts of money through trade.  There are a number of trade zones which you can send ships to to gather trade resources.  Prices of traded commodities change over time and merchant ships can be sunk by other factions and trade roots can be raided.  You can only trade with factions you have made a trade agreement with, and you can blockade ports.

You can also use agents to gather information about an enemy territory and to assassinate other characters.  Assassination is difficult, but possible.

Recommendation: If you have time to play a full campaign and the attention to detail to manage the resources and battles you will get a lot out of this game.  If you just want to play some battles there are some options for that too.

  ...With this iteration of total war, you get to spear head the ever expanding horizon of the new world. The campaign is heavily set in the Americans, with the colonisation of the new world. But will you take up the task of fighting the natives back or will you ally yourself with the new fraction ebbing its way across the country. Are your eyes set on the horizon in the west or the east?

 Set with the era of flint-lock rifles, the game play sets itself apart from its predecessors as new tactics must be deployed. No longer is the wars fought with swords and skill, give your me the line of sight and for goodness sake give them cover with nearby structures. Brutality is king in this explosive new game, blow your opponents up with your explosive cannon balls, tear through your opponents with ball-bearings. While they are distracted flank them with your cavalry and ram them in the rear.
 
 Just because your men do not need to be skilled to be enlisted, does not mean you can relax and breeze your way through it. The challenge of the command has never been greater, if you take your eye away from the enemy, you may find your rear exposed and the battle lost.

The AI in battle can be ridiculously laughable during certain moments. Also, in the campaign map their units will sometimes annoyingly create endless small stacks of armies, (I'm looking at you especially, you pesky Ottomans)  however, I feel that the positive outweighs the negative.

The scale of the campaign map is honestly one of my favorite things. You can create so many different scenarios. Nothing is more satisfying than starting off as a small nation in the brink of collapse by bigger and competing powers and building your way up to become an empire. Love the gunplay too. I would really love an Empire Total War 2 with improved AI/mechanics, more/new features, enhanced diplomacy, additional playable factions (though there are mods for that) and maybe even a larger, more detailed campaign map. I'm sure many others would love to see this happen. There's a lot of potential for it.

However, I would like to see some updates and improvements for future players.

-allow all nations to be playable.

  the game allows you to choose just a select few major nations and wont let your play the underdogs, dont get me wrong, I love destroying the world as the french or British. But to play as Mysore, Persia, the colonies or even the pirates would be an outstanding improvement to the overall re-play value of the game and will leave people coming back for more every time they play.


- more trade resources and more resource buildings.

  I know there are a large quantity of resources already, but the addition of historically expensive commodities such as opium, slaves, wampum, and gunpowder would increase the gameplay value for those who enjoy the trade aspect of the game, and since you have an in-game technology called ""abolition of slavery"" you could use that as a way to end slave trading in the game and thus cause a little havoc in the trade between the nations. 


- the addition of Asia

honestly I am shocked you didn't add Asia in this game to begin with, the silk road was a very crucial part of European trade and commerce and the addition of china and other Asian nations would have added another theatre to the war-map, only adding yet more playability value, although I am quite happy India was included as it to was crucial for the European trading scene. But Asia would have been a major improvement for the game. Although seeing as how your making the ""3 kingdoms"" game we will finally be able to play in Asia ... well ... China at least.


other than these I have no issues with the game and Enjoy it very much so. I give this game a ;

I think us veterans of the game have a love-hate relationship with it, because it's a pain in the butt at times, a huge one. But, it's also one of the most enjoyable games, the game introduced a lot of features never before seen in games like this. I think people who has given this game a chance know about the infamous glitches, for me the worst one is the game saving one where it causes the whole game to crash, however I always keep coming back to this game for more, even if I know that any turn could be my last. 

There is a simple way to lower the risk however, and it works, at least for me. You have an auto save of course but what I do is, not only keep the auto save but on turn one I save, and on turn two I save, making two save files plus the auto. And then, on each turn I overwrite those two save files. For example, on turn 3 I will overwrite 1, on turn 4 I will overwrite file 2, and so on. I will also sometimes make a third save file.

I also recommend playing this with darthmod, it adds a little bit more spice to the game, adding better effects for the muskets, cannons, rockets, etc and adding a little bit more realism, and it also unlocks nations to play such as the United States, which I am in the process of fulfilling manifest destiny and taking over the world.

""Warscape"" meant that tactics were no longer the primary focus on a battle, and stats were mostly what mattered. For instance, in a Medieval 2 battle you could beat an enemy army which greatly outmatched your own through moral shocks, Hammer & Anvil, whereas in Empire  and later installments this is much less doable. In fact, Cavalry charges -- and charges altogether -- are a complete mess, as Warscape seemingly annihilated any semblance of unit collision. 

Other points:
- A pathetic score
- Horrendous AI, even in your own units (constant re-shuffling of their formation, strange behaviour in sieges) 
- Disappointing Naval Battles (which CA still hasn't made enjoyable)

15,48697136,english,"Total War: Empire Definitive Edition is recommended for strategy and rts gamers, especially for those who have a particular interest in the XVIII century warfare. 

I am aware that when this game was launched, many claimed that it was the worst Total War game ever. Its reputation was not redeemed thanks to Creative Assembly employing its warscape engine for Rome 2. This engine, in my humble opinion, was good for musket and line formations rather than melee combat. That doomed Rome 2, for what I understand. 

Naturally, I was hesitant to play Empire with many youtubers and reviewers bashing it. Nevertheless I finally decided to buy it considering the Definitive Edition. I played the short Swedish campaign. Coming from Rome 1, my favorite game, I was expecting a different game, naturally, and I liked it. 

You get to play not only in Europe, but in the New World and India and there are various factions to choose from.

Regions are no longer represented only by a big city and a port, like in Rome 1. There is the region capital, mines, farms, towns and ports which will grow and evolve according to the technology tree the player selects. For instance, there are developments that favor happiness among the nobility and unrest in the lower classes; or buildings that favor a change of government from monarchy to republic. 

You can choose to play a grand campaign choosing among the various factions, paly the American Independence, a short campaign, the Warpath campaign (I have not played it yet), or custom battles. 

The gameplay is divided in classic Total War format: strategy layer in the world map, and battles in the tactical map. In the world map you develop your cities, towns and resources; build and manage armies. What happens in the world map may have important effects in the tactical portion and vice versa. You can choose to fight battles in the world map with auto resolve, or command your armies directly, both on land and sea. 

Two important difference in managing your armies take place. First, unlike Rome 1, generals are no longer members of the family, but rather are promoted among the ranks of the army. Secondly, when an army suffers casualties, you can merge units like before, but also you can replenish them without having to return to a city. Replenishment takes turns to be fully effective, but help you in continuing your war campaign. Furthermore, when you have a general in your army, he can recruit soldiers even if he is far away from any city, having to wait them to be recruited in the various cities, and marching to meet the army where the general is located.

The AI: this is one of the weak aspects of the game, especially when diplomacy comes to play. Sometimes you want to offer a trade agreement and the AI has an outrageous counter offer, for example, demanding one of your regions even if the AI faction is in the other side of the world with now power to take it. 

In battles, the limitations of the warscape engine show when melee attacks take place. Sieges are worse than in Rome 1 and I clearly can understand why so many people were disappointed. However, most of the time I found myself enjoying the two layers of the game: world strategy, tactical battles. So far, I have played only with Sweden, and found out that fighting the Russians was easy, but dealing with the Prussians was much harder. 

All in all, I recommend the game. The setting, the world map, the various factions plus the ones from the DLC included now in the one package Definitive Edition, offers hours of enjoyment. And let’s face it, the AI has never been the strength of CA, and while in Empire is especially less competent than in previous titles, the overall experience is positive. However, if you are die hard gamer who expects realistic AI, perhaps is better to stay away.",1549052263,1552178467,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198056258183,58,24,4134,55,3129,1601947613

Although there is plenty of bugs and the AI can be quite a pain in battles and on the campaign map (another reason for downloading the DarthMod).

Also this game was produced in 2009!! So give it a break for not being up to date with other games, furthermore, this game was ahead of the race when it was launched back last decade.

The battles (land and sea) look fantastic, with long lines of musket smoke drifting up from your troops/ships. Tech trees are filled with detail, if slightly long winded, and the diplomacy system is much improved from Medieval II (allies will no longer randomly turn on you...). 
Most of all, let me recommend the Darthmod for this game. It fixes the couple of issues the vanilla game had, such as a lack of unit diversity for some nations, and turns artillery into the deadly tool it actually was. The basegame AI isn't too bad, but with the Darthmod it will actually attempt complex tactics like flanking and concentrating artillery to create weak spots. 
My only remaining criticism is that siege battles in forts are just *awful*. I've read that this is essentially down to pathfinding issues with the AI creating massive lag in the processing. CA promised to fix it (spoiler alert: they didn't).

41,49012921,english,"My opinion of this game is the same as it was nearly 10 years ago, when this game first game out: Broken and ugly.

Empire Total War remains one of the most disappointing Total War games I have ever played. Despite being the largest (in land mass) game of the Franchise, it remains to be an empty game. Europe is broken up into a handful of regions, with places like France and Spain being 1 region each as oppose to being multiple, with nothing really unique in terms of map design, as you can easily conquer France as Britain within 1-2 turns from a fresh new campaign.

The units are ugly and are all just copy and pastes. The unit roster in this game is very dull and predictable, with Line Infantry making up the backbone of any army (with Guards and other elite units late-game) making the battles very samey after several battles, with the terrible AI making it even worse and not a challenge, even if it is on the highest difficulty. This wouldn't be as much of a problem if it was at least fun to watch. As aforementioned, the units of most of the factions are copy and pastes, with a slightly different colour to their uniforms, but that is really it. If you look at actual Uniforms from this period, you would see they were as diverse as their colour-schemes. The only 'uniqueness' are the DLC added unit packs.

A.I is terrible, like most CA games. Countries will randomly declare war on you for no reason, make outragous demands in order to get trade (including asking for tech, money and a region from you for a trade agreement, regardless if theyre a major power or not). Anyone that plays this game will know that a country like Britain, will ask for a shitty region from you in exchange for Scotland or a Caribbean region, you obviously reject it only for them to later send a fleet with an Army in it in order to take it; declaring war at the last minute.

Overall, this is a disaster of a game. If it wasn't for the fact its one of the few games set in this period, this game would be a distant memory.",1550254544,1550254544,False,5,0,0.498425006866455078,0,True,False,False,76561198074288231,168,21,8432,0,5171,1599747110

Total War: EMPIRE is a game developed by The Creative Assembly and published by SEGA and forms part of the Total War series

The game offers some pleasant graphics and really vibrant colours, although some ugly glitches here and there, it is pleasant all the same

The game does suffer with some repetitiveness at certain areas of the game but a fun game nonetheless

Total War: EMPIRE overall, however, is a fun game to play, yet sometimes flawed, but is a great grand strategy game to play in short bursts!

But, not all games are perfect so i got some criticisms for it:

2. Why cant you play as minor powers in the grand campaign:C
3. Why is the AI so bad at peace deals that they ask you for a province thats land locked? 
4. Why as prussia why the fuck does the dutch want my technologies
5. Why is there no options menu for you country like ex:(prussia uniting germany into one state) if you had that you can make a unified germany!
6. What's the deal with your spy dies on your territory after trying to kill a missionary?!
7. I ask you and i kidd you not WHY THE FOOK IS THERE NO TAKING THE HOLY LAND BUTTON/CRUSADE?
8. Last thing or i think, uhh why cant you make direct puppets and why cant you make new nations as independent or your puppet/protectorate?
OK, im finished

I think there was some therepuetic immersion for me slowly conquering the entire world as the United States in this time period. I did get it done. The game went until 1960 something and using those militia skirmishers in a manner never as intended to do it was a great deal of fun for me. I did play one multiplayer match as the U.S though after I felt I mastered them. I gave a highly ranked player a pretty good run for his money. Still fun. I would have conqured the world quicker if I had some tanks... not that tanks existed in the age of flintlocks and paper cartidges.. but one can hope.",1547747230,1547756571,True,17,6,0.597994685173034668,0,True,False,False,76561197970524649,264,13,24308,0,24308,1364799600

The campaign is so boring, that I always abandon it to play a better Total War Game.

I wish I didn't play this game for more than 2 hours, so I can get a refund. Worst game ever in the history of Total War and that includes it's failed mobile games.

The content of the game is really diverse. The weaknesses and strengths of each individual faction in the game is set realistically & historically accurate. The unique units factions possess are also great & historically accurate (The British having the Blackwatch Elite Infantry, The Maratha with the Elephants, The Ottomans with the 64-iber Artillery and the fearsome Organ Gun). I also really like the fact that you can create your own alternate timeline/history via the use of revolutions and other new features intoduced that did not exist in previous Total War games. 

Although minor, some flaws of this game are that the Campaign AI is sometimes stubborn af (they won't accept deals no matter what you offer them), Cavalry is very weak and have almost no effect in battles, and some minor limiting things, such as not being able to liberate a nation or a region without causing an intentional rebellion in the region, which takes 3 turns to onset. However if you play this game with DarthMod installed, it will basically make the game flawless.

I think that, over the years, the main thing that always bugged me was the unit sprite draw distance; the distance at which units on the map degraded in graphical quality to preserve rendering speed. Apart from that, the game has to be played at maximum difficulty to present any challange, and powerful countries such as England and France sometimes invade you even though historically it wouldn't make sense. 

Then there is the Ottoman Empire which takes huge chunks of time during the turn-switch, because it creates a million single-stack armies which all have to be moved aimlessly and whatnot - best to defeat the ottomans or weaken them early-on to save 3 minutes per turn. 

I have had a hate-love relationship with this game as I love the time period and the potential, but the poor execution of the game itself is a big turn-off.

22,47549764,english,"Compared to Rome total war 1. This game sucks. The campaign tutorial is too complicated. All this ""bajonett"" update and all this university update just to be able to build simple stuff is stupid. You have to wait 7 turns just to be able to upgrade your farms to have cows. Its stupid. Then you have all the mines and small cities or dockyards you have to click all these individual to update them or check for updates. So if you have 4 cities you have to do 20 clicks just to see what's updating and not. In rome total war you updated the mines or docks from the cities and made it more easy and simplistic. And you can focus on whats fun. The war :)
 
The units are basically all the same in all different countries. And the whole idea of the battlefield is to get your troops in as big line as possible. The battlefields has its charm the troop lining is fun but the troops never die. they can stand there reloading and shooting on eachother 30 times before someone run away. And in the long run it gets boring to just try to line your troops. The battlefield for cities are often done in the fortresses. And the fortresses are just a big concrete square.
 
The sea battlefield could have been more fun if the ships did more damage. circulating and shooting on each other for 20 rounds seem unrealistic when you have a general ship with that many canons.
 
The native americans was a disappointment. I thought there would be some fighting-spirits in them but the developed nations are just to good in the battlefield. So the natives just die like flies.

[h1] Gameplay [/h1]

This is a strategy game similar to Civilization. The difference is in the gameplay combat where for land battles (vs sea battles) you deploy your armies and engage the enemy. This is usually rather overwhelming for me because there is a lot of action happening on the screen at the same time and it is hard for me to keep track of all of my units. There are two aspects to gameplay: nation building and combat.

Either nation building or combat can be automated. With nation building you can have the computer automatically manage your tax and construction policy if you would rather focus on combat. And you can automatically resolve any combat option.

[h1] Story / Engagement [/h1]

Not much of a story. Just try to build your empire at the expense of your enemies (and allies) by leveraging resource management, trade, diplomacy, and military might. Diplomacy can be frustrating as, seemingly, fair deals are often rejected by the computer controlled nations. 

[h1] Compatible with Linux [/h1]

Yes, no problems. 

[h1] Time Spent on Game [/h1]

old version: Its a fantastic game i played it for hours and hours.

I've voted for this game in twice during award voting. This game is for me at least, exciting, engaging and allows you to really conquer the entire World as the smallest of nations. Get the Darth Mod, now you can play as even more countries and the AI isn't as dense. :) All in all, it's 2017 and I still highly recommend this game despite the fact that all Total War games can be buggy, can have issues and sometimes act up, this one seemed fairly solid for me..",1479931860,1543277493,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198009786397,1257,3,7270,0,6407,1585162214
66,47044753,english,"I am a staunch Strategy/CIty Builder games fan. Always have been starting from the days of Populous: The Beginning, Caesar III, Age of Empires II and other classics. I love every kind of strategy : RTS, Turn Based and what not. Total War in that regard has been a constant companion over the years. I started playing Total War: Rome when I was in highschool and spent so many hours on it and I learned so much because it increased my already manic levels of love for history. Then came Medieval II, Empire and more. All of them have been amazing. There are tons of mods and wonderful player made content that keeps these games fresh and fun even now.

Though I had one regret - I love beautiful graphics and these games which once seemed amazing looking have started looking dull after seeing better graphics quality. So you can imagine how happy I was when I suddenly got a mail stating that all my Total War games were being updated to modern graphics for free! What a gift! Brilliant move CA! 

All the gripes we had about the DLC's just vanished. Empire is one of the classics even among the stellar Total War series due to it's unique map, time period. mechanics and troops. It's amazingly fun to say the least. Now with updated graphics, it's going to take up all my free time :) 

For those who have never played these TW games, I recommend you to do so. They're worth everything you pay for and more. Especially if you pick them up during the Summer Sale or Publisher sale. You get massively steep discounts for the entire franchise excluding the latest Warhammer installment. Hoping to see more players online!

It shouldnt be so easy for one army to come in and destroy multiple settlements in one fcking turn. How the fck doe agent even work in this game, why cant i just recruite the ones i need. Why does every country have the same units, boring. I can hardly fcking see which units i selected in my unitmenu when im in battle, jesus fcking christ how hard can it be to make the border a clear different color of a unit which you select. For a new player it isnt clear which color, white or black, shows whether an abbility of an unit is on or off. Not sure if it is just me, but cav dont do any damage whatsoever.

67,45039094,english,"Game Summary:
Empire: Total War is set in the 18th century, a turbulent era and a period alive with global conflict, revolutionary fervour and technological advances. The game features themes such as the Industrial Revolution, America's struggle for independence, the race to control Eastern trade routes and the globalisation of war on land and sea. Empire: Total War saw the debut of 3D naval combat within the Total War franchise. Players intuitively command vast fleets or single ships upon seascapes rich with extraordinary water and weather effects that play a huge role in your eventual glorious success or ignominious defeat. After pummelling your enemy with cannon fire, close in to grapple their ship and prepare to board taking control your men as they fight hand to hand on the decks. Empire: Total War also saw further enhancements to the Total War series signature 3D battles and turn based campaign map. Real time battles pose new challenges with the addition of cannon and musket, challenging players to master new formations and tactics as a result of the increasing role of gunpowder within warfare. And the Campaign Map – for many the heart of Total War – saw new improved systems for Trade, Diplomacy and Espionage with agents, a refined and streamlined UI, improved Advisors and extended scope taking in the riches of India, the turbulence of Europe and the untapped potential of North America.",1538395039,1538395279,True,1,1,0.504980087280273438,0,True,False,False,76561198013629218,654,6,4638,0,3710,1554394843

Usually CA try to avoid such direct competition with their own work, rotating themes and eras as they go so the next time they hit the same or similar era some time has passed (see the gap between M:TW 1&2, Shogun 1&2, Rome 1&2, etc.). Sadly this was not one of their better entries and I just can't enjoy it much despite my appreciation for the era and the kind of tactics used and what it allows for in gaming. If you want Napolenic or Colonial era strategy fun focused around musket formations and the shot/cavalry/cannon concept then you should look elsewhere. It is thankfully a well covered era by many developers, especially if you also include the earlier ""pike and shot"" era of warfare. If you just want any Total War style game then there are many others to choose from too and modding options really should be taken into account and explored.

The system does not need to be honoured so you are better off spending it on making your own nation better instead of caring about what other nations can help you. I assure you, they will not.

76,43711910,english,"A great, magnificent, yet flawed game. I have hundreds of hours into this game on another steam account and there is good reason for it. Not since has CA made a game with such scope, such grandiosity. You can literally conquer almost the entire world. The possibilities are endless. 

Want Russia to control the Bahamas and fight pirates in the Caribbean? Check. Want to see endless hordes of Native American soldiers crash against Prussian cannon batteries in Georgia? Check. Want to cause political unrest in your enemies homelands by giving them enlightenment technologies in the late game for no seemingly good reason? Check. Want to watch the utter awesomeness of the ""fire by rank"" tech while your line infantry mow down helpless Firelock Armed Populace defending Berlin? Check. Want to watch your best and greatest Heavy First Rate ship completely obliterate enemy sloops and then rage when it catches on fire and blows up? Check. There are many, many more examples. 

I am prepared to talk about the not so good aspects of the game. Mainly, it seems that CA basically abandoned this game after not too long. There are a great deal of bugs and ridiculous AI moves that will have you shaking your head. In fact the AI is probably the worst part of the game. Instead of being competent, the AI has extreme buffs on higher difficulties which feels cheap at times. That said, there are many ways to exploit the AI and basically win every single battle. There are also a number of things missing in the game, parts of the game that need modding or tweaking but are lacking.

Also you can basically forget about diplomacy. Allies will constantly betray you for no reason, other factions will almost NEVER accept the most reasonable terms in diplomacy unless it is massively in their favor. Once you declare war on a faction or are declared upon, it is almost always a fight to the death, winner takes all, no place for peace. Diplomacy has a very small place in this game, especially on higher difficulties.

As I said it seems CA basically abandoned this game and moved on to Napoleon TW immediately. For example, you cannot repair city fortifications. Remember that one time Poland attacked Berlin, made a hole in the wall with a cannon that one time? Hope you like that massive opening in your fortifications, because there is no way to repair it. Only way to do so would be to tear it completely down and build an entirely new fort. The list goes on.

91,43467556,english,"Positives:

1. Empire Total War brings a militarily interesting period of history and brings it to you in a pleasing manner that is at times intense and can keep you on the edge of your seat. This RTS/ Turn Based Grand Strategy offers an interesting experience by pushing many new concepts in the Total War Franchise up to this games release date. 

2. The warfare can be at times quite riveting and draw you into the game and leave you on the edge of your seat at some moments. Though this does happen uncommonly, there is something extremely exciting when your army become engaged with a force of either equal or larger size and if they quality of those troops are just as strong as yours. Those moments really suck you into the game and can leave you with moments of tense excitement as you know a single wrong move in those instances can lead to defeat. Then there is the amazing satisfaction of seeing a risky strategy lead to complete and overwhelming sucess that leaves you extremely satisfied. The scale of the combat is awe inspiring too, this is due to the amount of soldiers that exist on the field at anyone time. Typically most RTS see no more then 250 units (this is still even extremely high and unusual). Total War throws that away with their games and puts over 1000 men on the field. This size and scope is always amazing to see and always leaves me awestruck. Especially in Empire when you see long lines of Line infantry moving into position to slug it out with an opposing regiment. Artillery is amazing to watch in this game as well as you watch sections of regiments get blown away leaving holes in the enemy's regiment. 

3. Naval Combat was introduced as a commandable battle rather then AI in previous Total War titles. I do find this combat event to be at times fun and impressive to watch. 

4. Large campaign map that covers 3 continents with trade and colonies becoming more important then previous titles. If you are playing as the Netherlands, and your main trading port is blockaded, your economy practically disappears. Leads to more strategy with the new emphasis on trade. 

5. Some of the nations start out with extremely fun and interesting scenarios ot play. Example: Prussia being forced to blitz early on to unify it's land and fight multiple enemies from the beginning. Dutch starting with few territories and only one European territory. 

Negatives:

1. The combat is slow. Though I said there were times it deserved praise, the combat for the most part is slow and repetitive. Either you can completely overwhelm an enemy or they completely overwhelm you. Even then, the scope of the tactical maps is too large. To set up an attack properly, it can sometimes take up to 15-20 minutes. Especially in a game where position is key to sucess, this is a tedious and annoying process. Then the AI doesn't always pick quality units. So even if you see that the battle is obviously already a no brainer, that doesn't mean the auto resolve will agree and then you are stuck fighting an annoying fight that seems like a chore. Cavalry is still used in Empire, but it's relevance compared to previous titles has decreased significantly. Infantry is king in this game. This lack of usefullness by calvary makes the battles that much longer. 

2. While Naval Combat is impressive at times to watch, I do belive it is just as slow at times. Then the AI doesn't place as much emphasis on naval battles, so most battles are never using the maximum potential of naval units available. This leaves this awesome feature feeling underwhelming. 

3. The Grand Strategy aspect feels slow and sluggish. The movement ranges can feel slow. I think Mid II handled this well by making the cities closer together. This time the cities are more distant which leaves the player having to spend more time moving units then actually fighting. 

4. There are way too many rebellions. Every time you take a city, you can expect at least 2 or 3 rebellions. This lengthens the game time unecessarily against rebel armies that are often extremely underwhelming and never too big of a threat unless you took a city with a small force. These feel more like a chore then actually productive to the game. 

5. The campaign map is huge, but it would be amazing to expand the map even more. Empire leaves large strethces of land blank of cities or doesn't even count them as territory. France is a huge chunk of territory and could be broken up even more, instead it's one giant region. Spain is the same way and those both could have been split up more. 

6. The battles could have been even more overwhelming. The little puffs of smoke could be more epic and weapons could sound like weapons instead of fireworks. The battles are awesome to watch, but they could have been even more so with a few tweaks.

Overall:

I enjoyed Empire. I put plenty of hours into it. I do believe that this game is underwhelming though in the grand scheme of things. Empire had far more potential then the final product then was given to the player community. I still feel like it is an experience worth having and would recommend it. But that would be a recommendation that would require alot of explanation behind it as well.",1531326406,1531326406,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198057266649,199,8,22349,0,21624,1557250420

Basically you need close to a full stack of troops to take a city. Auto resolve does a way worse
job than you will. When troops are on ships, you can load them onto coasts when you're near,
hold your cursor over the land and you'll see it transform into a man with an arrow, that
will let you drop them off. Before I thought you had to use ports. 

It is pretty fun but gets repetative. The ship battles I never really figured out. I'd always 
skip them. Sometimes trading and negotiation is odd too. Like You can offer 3x the land
with 2x the revenue/population as well as a pile of cash and tech and even a close ally
seems to say no. But it's a victory condition. And war would be impossible. So there are a lot of
unintuitive aspects. Positioning troops, out manouvering the enemy, sending cavalry in a line
against unguarded cannon. All good. 

it brings you back historically to a period where warfare was different. Where personal
heroism still mattered a great deal. It's a real time sink though. And waiting for the various
countries to take their turns is just like civ, a grind to wait through. You do get into a flow

I enjoyed playing the grand campaign multiple times, and ended up wishing it encompassed more of the world and a longer timeframe than 1700 - 1800. Custom battles are fun on both land and sea, but sadly the battle AI appears quite basic, either you can run rings around them, or they relentlessly attack.

The campaign AI has issues too, as they simply refuse any deal you try to make; before eventually declaring war for no reason. The game itself is plagued by countless glitches and oversights left in. It's heartbreaking because so many look fixable, as if SEGA forced Creative Assembly to make Napoleon: Total War rather than fix Empire.

The worst issue seems to be a memory leak which reduces the frame rate massively, and the dreaded fort lag. Empire is a flawed game, but that doesn't stop it from being playable, and considering that Imperial Glory was the only competition (and had less scope), then Empire owns a big reputation for what it offers.

The campaign and battle HUDs are so similar that their outline eventually got burned into my monitor, and I don't regret playing it at all, I just wish it was given the polish it clearly deserves. The short-lived RedShell debacle did nothing to help the reputation of the game.

If you look at a lot of the reviews for this game, they'll say that the AI is as thick as a bucket of shit, but my god is the AI stupid! They do stupid things like charging in their GENERAL, or just walking up to you and getting ripped apart by Light Foot or Skirmishers. And trust me, there's a lot more where that came from. Your units require complete and utter attention, because none of them have any regard for friendly fire and will happily shoot through your own units if placed behind! There's a lot more but I don't have enough space to list that. The soldiers in units have no personality, no individuality at all. All of the animations are completely in sync as if they're freakin' robots. Yet they don't march in sync like they should? What? In the vanilla game all of the Line Infantry units for each country are re-colours of the other. Very well done CA. Then, there's the sea battles. Okay, so the ship skins are rubbish, the 'marine' skins are rubbish, the affect that a broadside actually has is minute, the cannons (and the muskets for that matter) make a small puff of smoke and the AI is still as dumb as ever. Now, the Campaign. The Campaign is one of the largest areas of ETW that show how disgustingly unreliable the game is. I've found that: If you hover over certain parts of the map you'll get a framerate of 0.00000001, the diplomacy is utter bollocks, I've had the Ottoman Empire asking me for Scotland, the 'portraits' of Kings/Queens/Gentlemen etc are hilarious and the game will eventually just shoot itself.

One of the unique things that I've always enjoyed about TW is that they've always got some authentic units and battle mechanics. Now, specifically in regards to ""Empire"" not TW as a whole. Empire is one of my favorite takes. When I originally started, I was absolutely overwhelmed with all of the in's-and-out's of the mangement portion of the game. Thankfully, they had an option to let that sort itself out. This feature helps me stay focused more on the conquest and less on the economics. Additionally, they have a cool take on Naval warfare. However, there is one thing I'll complain about. It's with the auto-resolve feature. 
When the game indicates that you're opponents army and yours is ""close"" in strength before entering into a battle, DO NOT AUTORESOLVE IT. Unless there is some type of landslide margin between the two armies, you're almost always going to lose an absolutely unneccessary amount of units. My advice, just hate it, and fight the battle. I've found that even when I'm outmatched, not only do I win, but I lose much fewer units. Idk, it's a small thing really--especially since I jump into TW for it's epic battles anyway! 
That's my only complaint. Like at all. This game is freakin awesome. Buy it--if you like TW, you'll probably like this. If you like CIV, you'll probably like this.

45,42779705,english,"Empire is looked down upon by the older fans due to a bad release but tis is a fun total war game dont get me wrong though as it has its faults. Campaign: It is large, very large, as it has 3 continets to cover which makes it difficult to mange when you arwe begining but certain factions like: Prussia and Austria dont worry about this as they are only european based factions. Larger nations such as the French and British are coverng all three continets, but trouble arises early as you have to mange alot and you are forced to maintain one continet at a time. Road to Idepedentance campaign is fun following the first colony at Jamestown to a new nation the United Sates of America. Battles: These are like Napoleon but are smaller and unit variety between factions is minimal especially when you paly in the early time period battles bt in the late each faction presents their own units but all of them have a few units in common. Anval battles where introduced in this game and they are fun to have large ship battle in line firing one at a time but this was the first game with is so I'll go easy on it. What I Dislike: one on one unit battles where a single character will attack a single man and it will be more ""cinimeatic"" but this kills immersion.

48,30002404,english,"Total War has become so expansive with so many entries that I'm not going to waste time recapping what it is or how it's differnt than other strategy games, rather I'll just compare it to other Total War entries.  If you are Total War veteran, skip to the final conclusion at the end.

  On a scale of good to bad, this game falls pretty solidly in the middle of the Total War franchise.  It's by no means the masterpiece that the first Rome game was, but Empire offers such an expansive and all encompassing world that it manages to stand out from other titles in the series.

 Empire is all about Width over depth.  There isn't anything particularly deep and the boundaries are met rather quickly, but on the whole that feels okay because rather than just focusing on some smaller world map like the Medditerranian or Japan, you have almost the entire world at your finger tips.

 A lot of changes while somewhat shallow, are at least interesting additions such as the way your territories build and max out with hotspots.  

  For someone who is a fan of the series, this is a solid game to check out and worth your time.  If you are new, it's a fine game but there are better Total War games to start with.

50,41957720,english,"I usually love historical strategy games, especially those covering the 18th Century. Unfortunately, I am unable to love this one; I found it too exasperating to be fun. So may aspects of it are so clunky, badly designed and annoying, that I ended up abandoning it in disgust. It might have helped if they had bothered to give us a  tutorial for the main, turn-based part of the game. But no, you'll have to buy 'Napoleon: Total War' if you want that essential feature, but even there, it is inadequate.

I wasted so many hours baffling over this game, trying to figure things out, like why ship's captains keeps saying, sarcastically: ""This is a ship, Sir; it cannot sail on land!"", when I was not trying to sail it on land! And how to get armies and/or agents into ships and how to disembark them, without them disappearing. There is no simple drag and drop for this, instead they have a system that's more cryptic than a Rubic's cube. 

Getting your trade ships to do any trading is also as baffling as a jigsaw puzzle with misfitting pieces. Almost every time you try to put your ship on a trading node (if you are lucky enough to find one), another ship instantly appears and blocks you, as soon as you click on the node. This is accompanied by the message: ""Another character is blocking your path"". (Oh, so I'm a ""character"", am I?) It's all the crap like this that drove me to cut my losses and bin this time-wasting tangle-fest. When people pay good money for a game, they want to have fun, for heaven's sake; not spend hours vexing over how to perform simple operations.

The game's interface is not particularly attractive, and there is an intolerable wait between turns while we are made to sit through a tedious, unnecessarily long-winded graphic representation of what the rest of the world is doing for its turns, represented by characters strutting around the map, doing God knows what, and ships that sail a few miles and then often mysteriously vanish.
 
The game also crashes too often, and there is no option to load earlier saves. So, if the game's screwed-up mechanics trips you up disastrously when you are well into the campaign, tough luck, buddy, you either keep playing, or start the campaign again from scratch!

Lastly, I don't think the devs had a clue who they were targeting when they designed this game. On the one hand, the educational pop-up windows seem suited to grown-up History students, while on the other hand, the British military officers all talk like cringeworthy charicatures, as though they are trying to amuse six-year-olds. Stuff like that puts short thrift to any hope of game immersion.

Had I paid the full and extortionate price for this game, I would have been truly peeved. As it is, I'll regard it as a learning experience - i.e. to be wary of ever buying another game from this studio.

The designers would have done themselves a big favour if they had looked at and considered the merits of an older game called  'Imperial Glory'. That game was a real pleasure, compared to this cack-handed clunker - and a tiny fraction of the price, too.

It's a good place to begin from and the battles are fun and immersive as usual with technological advancements through the ages giving you a greater arsenal and varied strategies to play around with.The naval battles alsoo provide an interesting combat expirience to break any monotony you may endure during a campaign.
While it may not be the pinnacle of TW games it certainly is worth a shot and you might just like it quite a bit. Think of it as a filler between meals, a kind of tasty snack thats filling and enjoyable would be one way to describe the game.

I'm truly sorry, for I would love to recommend this game - as far as I know the only one with polish Winged Hussars in it, with the ability to send them to beat the crap out of Americas and India. Nice historical setup, nice history background for almost anything, if you care to read all the tiny texts. Nice battle graphics, dudes in units are slightly different from each other...

But.
There is a saying, ""Anything before 'but' doesn't count"".

But.

- The AI is a moron. 
    * Pike squares with their back to the wall, on which there is significant musket and arty covering fire? Charge it with cav. 1 unit at time, of course. And maaany more idiotic behaviors I could make a small book of.
    * Yeah, arty on the wall. Try getting your troops to man it. Works +/- nice with units around 60-man size, with bigger? Nope. They will keep staggering going to the cannons and away. Inch towards cannons, inch away, forever. Never getting to man them, or do anything as complex as properly line up at top of the wall to fire off it. Maybe like 10 men out of 120 will fire. But! Mostly only after you specifically tell them to. They will first rotate 1 man in rank, stand idly, then aim->fire. After like 10s from enemy getting in range. This is enough time for the enemy to get past the range, many times.
     * Sieges in general. Tell the units to get out of the fort clicking a bit past one gate you want them to get out through. Think they will use that one? Only if you're lucky. But then, if they try to use the right one, it won't open for them. They will all get clumped in the passage by the gate. After quite a bit of clicking, you will get them unstuck, but.. Almost never all of them. 5-10 chars from a unit can get like perma-stuck in there, just on the corner of a fkin gate.
     * Fire by rank? Doesn't apply to shooting at charging cavalry, or any units passing left-to-right in front of your shooters. Because reasons.

- Bugs.
     * Build a church or whatever it's called, get no religious agent for 77 turns. Build another, get none either. Raze and rebuild, still nothing. M-hm.
     * Units that are supposed to be sneaking while not running often just don't sneak for no apparent reason.
     * I hover my mouse over Danemark's capital. FPS drops to 0.5 (my computer handles Witcher 3 on max details easy). Ofc you can't get there even though there are these magical golden arrows.
     * Game crashes occasionally, because reasons. Even in middle of a hour-long siege exhaustion battle.
     * No turning battle camera left with mouse drag. Turning right is ok... Oh wait, no, it no longer works too. Funny, it just worked a sec ago.
     * Even if you sincerely FK all the above, because you want your winged hussars to conquer America too badly. Even if you don't play sieges, just fatigue the cities. Resign from even looking at Danemark or converting the populace. Even if you settle for everything above, get to almost beat two big empires, start thinking about building up a fleet to claim New World... Just when you get a grasp of it all... Then ALL your saves get corrupt. Campaign fkin over. This was my trigger to write this review. I am quite bloody upset.

- My personal feelings
     * Tech tree is a joke.
     * There are more unit types in AoE 2. Even counting all faction specials as 1.
     * The camera is clunky.
     * Maaany UI elements are missing. Like view all towns which have development available or need repairs, or show points where your trade routes are being raided. Try doing it yourselves when you get bigger, I dare you.
     * Cav is a joke. They lose to everything. No point in making more than 2 cav units per army, just for 'flanked' morale debuff and chasing down stuff in a win-more situation. I sure hoped Winged Hussars will be better than this, but never got to play them...
     * Obstacles on battle map are clunky and unintuitive to get advantage of.
     * Clunky cam + very varying terrain height = trying to make your cannons/shooters fire only to see they hit terrain/don't fire at all. Then zoom in, narrow your eyes, examine, examine, exaaamine... Oh damn, there IS a small uphill here, so my guys don't have a clear shot. Fk.
     * Mighty <> Spectacular <> Terrifying... Which one is bloody higher? Mby add Ludicrous, too.
     * What does prestige stand for? Actual army size or battles won or friggin what does this tell me?
     * I feel spammed by all the notifications already, why the sudden fk do the barbary states have to sue for peace every turn?



Overall... I wish it worked. But even with my enthusiastic attitude towards the very idea of this game... I can't recommend it. It's not worth your time and cash. You will find only frustration here.

With ships taking months to reach places like the Americas and India it's not 'realistic to have them on one combined map like every other Total War game. This makes for a fantastic battle of the sea's. Sure you can own America or India - or both - but if your enemies decide to raid your trade routes out in Brazil, The Ivory Coast - wherever they may be - then you're drawn into battle - your loss is their gain... Making supply raids a fantastic way to earn income.

Like I said this is something which is has been drastically missing from recent Total War games and I've loved this aspect of it.

On a downside the AI is pretty terrible in battle, and the automatic battle is massively broken - to the point of being almost game-breaking. I've had 18 stack armies lose to 10 stack armies of the EXACT same level of units. If I play those battles out I'll absolutely destroy the computer losing probably 10% of my men in comparison to 50-60% losses if I actually win an auto-battle. As it's expensive to replenish your armies this changes your whole economic strategy, meaning you pretty much have to play each battle out yourself.

The AI is appauling. They seem to have a few problems within siege battles as they find it quite difficult to get the whole unit inside/outside the fortress. I could go over so many other examples but theyre is no point as it would take anyone whos reading this around 5 more minutes. The campaign (excluding the american independence storyline) is great in some parts and bad in others. I would reccomend playing maybe 1-2 campaign's within your time playing this. The multiplayer aspect is very good, with the only problem being the AI once again. Multiplayer allows you to be a bit more competitive, as sometimes they just give the AI an unfair advantage. 

If you want to play in 4k, i would not reccomend it as I have experienced alot of screen tearing on the campaign map. I would reccomend playing within the HD range as it can cope with that definition.

I'm going to recommend this as I've always had a blast with this game. Its just that it may be a bit hard to keep the enthusiasm within this game.

I DO NOT recommend this Total war game though.

This just so happens to be my first Total War game. I enjoyed the style of the campaign and how big the battles can be...but I was heavily let down by the unit design/how they respond in battle/useless ship battles/a number of other things listed below.

+ The game does take strategy to a high degree, being able to win against a force of 1000 troops with only a force of 200 troops of your own, used in the right ways. Or rather, one right way...

+ Tons and tons of economy management with many options to choose from.

+ Agents, being both notoriously OP in specific circumstances to bottomline useless in others. I had fun with them though.


- There are a solid amount of differing units, but more than half of them are basically the same unit with a lesser number and some minor stat changes. So all in all, there are 4 units in total. Ranged attackers, Cavalry, Cannons, and Grenediers.

- Attrociously stupid AI. That 1000 vs 200 troop battle I mentioned above? All due to flanking. This isn't is a bad thing...but let me explain: The AI loves to send in either 1 small garrison of troops or turtles until you get close, in which case, they rinse and repeat that sending in of 1 set of troops at a time. This makes it very easy to flank them constantly. 

- All battles are won by flanking. The few times I saw good AI, was when they had reinforcements come in that I was unaware of, which flanked my squad and ultimately caused my squad to panic and run away.

- Routing I feel like is a dumb mechanic that needs to be squashed away. It's far to easy to rout by flanking. Sometimes a simple flank will kill 1 or 2 troops of 120 troop squad and the whole squad will bolt out of there. 

- Cannons were absolutely useless. I did heavy googling and was told Canister Shot was the only useful part of cannons, and they were right. But still not nearly as useful as a load of cavalry that you can flank enemies with.

- Unit management in battle is FRUSTRATING. They require lining themselves up constantly in an attempt to imitate the 1700-1800s style of strategic troop placement, wasting precious time, before ever firing a single bullet. Units get bugged on fortress walls, not sure whether to go up or down the stairs when attacking enemies. Units will not shoot enemies at all sometimes, just staring at them blankly while the enemy shoots at you. 

- They threw in the American Revolution as a story point but they didn't add any story into the campaign. A pointless contribution.

This is perhaps one of my favourite Total War titles and funnily enough Empire was the one that got me into the Total War franchise. Now i played vanilla for a couple of hours and had a good long campagine with Britian, Sweden and Prussia. (Including the Road To Independence campagine). 

I then used mods because you quickly find out that you can only play the major nations of that time period, such as Britain, France, Spain, Russia etc. The big bois. I downloaded the minor factions mod and holy shit it makes the game a hundread times better! The mod lets you play every single nation (hence the name) that you can't play in vanilla, which is strange really because it would've probs received better reception. I'm still using Minor Factions Revenge to this day and haven't returned to vanilla since, it not only gives u the ability to play every nation available, but it also has custom sounds, FX, units, soundtrack, models, historical figures, tech, UI etc. There are also plenty of other mods out there such as Darthmod and ACW (American civil war), again some key elements that was missing from vanilla, the mods are an all around improvement of the game and supposedly what ETW was meant to be but we didn't get.

66,40727362,english,"I will preface this review by saying: if you are a fan of Napoleon Total War, then this game is a fun side-on (even though technically it came out first). I quite enjoy this game and can (to an extent) understand the praise heaped upon it by reviewers on release. However...

This game has gained a notorious reputation due to its AI and path-finding, and these two factors turn the game almost into one of luck. On the one hand even on Hard difficulty, the AI enemies have two strategies, one for defence (turtling) and one for offense (sending their units at you in a big line that can easily be outflanked). Therefore, even if you are outnumbered five to one, you can still easily win, thus presenting no real challenge. On the other hand, the way in which the units control (at least is my opinion) is atrocious. I cannot count how many times I have given clear instructions to a unit to line up on one side of a wall to defend it, only to come back a minute later to find them facing the opposite direction and being shot in the back. Even if you are a military genius, you can potentially lose battles due to your units simply disobeying orders, or the UI and controls being so bad that they bug out and do whatever the hell they want.

In campaign mode, the Diplomacy is also a joke (a running theme in some of the Total War games) with the AI being either hyper aggressive (never surrendering or making peace even if you are crushing them) or being flat out stupid (declaring war on long time allies just because).

If you like Total War (like I do) then you will probably enjoy this game. However, if you have to choose between this and Napoleon for the Lined Infantry style of warfare, choose Napoleon: it is far better in graphical quality, UI quality and is much more refined.",1520730498,1520730498,True,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,76561198105748483,91,14,3371,0,118,1598295706

This game sucks!

[h1]Pros:[/h1]
[list]
[*] Huge map. One of the biggest in Total War history.
[*] Loads of factions.
[*] Possibly the only modern game based in this time period.
[/list]
[h1]Cons:[/h1]
[list]
[*] Bugs everywhere! Your game could come to an end at any moment thanks to unfixable game breaking bugs. There are so many minor and major bugs that I can't even list them all!
[*] AI is abysmal on the campaign map and in battles! The AI will charge back and forth in front of your lines and won't attack. Your own troops will sometimes decide not to fire at all. Your own troops won't fire unless every single man is in formation so if one man is stuck the whole unit will stand and do nothing! Melee combat is awful as your troops will sometimes stand staring at each other instead of fighting. AI will make the dumbest diplomatic decisions. AI will recruit armies that make no strategic sense! The AI will never flank you, if you flank the AI you will win everytime. Whole units might commit suicide during seige battles by climbing down off the wall and dying for no reason. Units are really slow at doing anything to tell them to do. Cannons are completely useless. Sometimes the AI won't attack when they're supposed to and if you turned off battle timer you're screwed! THE LIST GOES ON...
[*] Routing mechanic is broken, I've seen whole units of 120 men break and run because 1 or 2 men got shot.
[*] The mods do not fix this game! Some idiots say there are mods that fix the game but trust me they don't. The core gameplay is broken and no mod can fix it.

WHATEVER YOU DO DON'T BUY THIS. The positive reviews are written through nostalgia goggles, you would have to be half brain dead to enjoy this. The reason for why Napoleon: Total War exists is because Creative Assembly was aware how awful Empire: Total War was.

Just don't buy this and don't listen to anyone who tells you otherwise. This is as broken as Rome 2 was.

Even Medieval was better. The bad mechanics let down what is a really interesting setting for a Total War game. Switching between melee and ranged mode for units has yet to work without bugging. Its too unreliable to even consider using anymore, it literally just makes units stop moving, cease firing, and await death. In the world map, a single unit can raid multiple resources in a turn and hamstring your entire civilisation unless you garrison every single farm/mine/school/port, (of which there are several per region) simply so a stray bandit wont begin a famine that unravells your entire society. If you're at war with a faction and they wish for peace, they will pester you every single turn until they get it. So enjoy 45 seconds of denying peace every turn as every faction has a crack at it every single turn. AI has no prompting to attack when theyre attempting to break a seige, so you enter a battle the enemy instigated, and then they just wait for you to storm the walls, completely nullifying the point of seiging in the first place.

Empire: Total War is a blissful take on what a [strike]good[/strike] great strategy game is. While being a little (it's not even noticeable, really) buggy in regards to A.I controlled opponents, overall it's not even an issue. The campaign mode is detailed; enormously detailed. I first loaded up a 'World Domination' campaign as France and almost lost my mind. Initially, I thought to myself ""This is too complex, I just want to control some soldiers and punch on with England"". 3 days later, i'm still playing the same campaign, currently negotiating with Spain over the new American world, losing my trade routes to Swedish raiders, desperately rallying soldiers for a fresh Prussian invasion to the east, and putting down rebellions constantly in England while they refuse my rule.

Annoyed by politics in the real world? Load up Empire: Total War and just fire ministers for the hell of it. Problems with England expanding into resource-rich America? Just take London by force, and cut them off early. It's a game where you control how your empire unfolds, who your friends are, or if you want to just take everyone down with you.

What attracted me to the Total War franchise are the battles themselves though. It's always a moment of absolute awe the first time you enter the deployment screen and see the tens and thousands of your units ready and willing to engage the enemy, and the tactics you need to utilise. Every unit serves a function, from cheap meat shields, to fully armoured heavy cavalry, right down to hit and run skirmishers. Morale is everything. Your soldiers will only fight as well as the rest of your army; the more weak points you have, the more likely it is you will be scattered. Your soldiers gain experience and ranks which are so valuable it isn't even funny. Facing a 10,000+ Austrian invasion force? Your highly experienced 2000+ linesman will shock you with how well they perform. Seriously. I've faced utter annihilation holed up in a fort with barely 400 soldiers, and still managed to hold the line against almost 5,000 Ottoman soldiers, all thanks to how mobile they were around the siege, and how battle hardened they already were.

So far, I can't stop playing. I'm at work right now writing this, hoping to pass the time until I can get home in... 6 hours, 28 minutes, load up my campaign, and get right back to sending those loyalist redcoats right back to the hell they came from.

So, when I started, I had only those beginning regions, and some protectorates, soon, Sweden declared war on Russia, I responded with my army, and, much like star wars, they were raw recruits, then they became my 501st, they went all throughout Sweden, eventually, and finally, conquering it, I think it took 20 years, at the same time I spent some time, reforming the infrastructure, and then went to war with Prussia when they swindled me into a deal, I quickly overran them, went to war with Westphalia, lost the Great General Miloslaw, who died in Bavaria, he was replaced with General Miloslaw, Westphalia, however, was a total loss, I had no idea what we were up against, and signed peace, went to war with Hannover, Berlin rebels, and three battles are fought to take it back, one when my troops were defending, the second when I was laying siege, and they attacked me, and the third when the only survivors of the second tried attacking, effectively ending them, at this same time, took over Hannover, but cut them a deal, they were now my protectorate, time passes, spend on troops, and infrastructure, realize nearing campaign deadline, invade Austria, win!",1514099559,1514099559,True,1,0,0.5,0,True,False,False,76561198290660464,96,11,4929,0,1064,1599530939

It takes a little practice to understand keeping  your ships in line or double line formation while both navies hammer away at each other with shot and grape. I haven't used any mods in this game, so that may be an option to explore. 

Not sure if there are any major dislikes other than needing a variety in additional ship types like the Spanish and Russian navies who sported very unique ship designs. The landscape also can be a little bit infuriating because it's a bit of a departure from the more contoured landscapes of Medieval II. There are also some minor bugs, but its more inconvenience rather than anything that dimishes play. 

Although there are some minor issues, these are overshadowed at least for me by the primary items listed since I've seen few other games that focus on that aspect of naval combat and done in a way that gives it justice.

Britain battled its way into France, the war lasting a few long bloody years, until Britain managed to vanquish the French to hell. It was time for peace across the Empire, money from trade gave the people and cities of the Empire a whole host of new technologies not to mention wealth, war was no longer on the agenda for Britain. Peace with all their immediate neighbours was now the key. 

The American front was abandoned, too costly for the Empire to pursue. The money gained over many years of peace now began to become too great to ignore, something had to be done. A show of grandeur? A voyage to the new world perhaps? No. A voyage to another continent entirely, this was Britain's goal. A war with India ensued for decades but finally the war came to and end and the good times followed. Wealth unimaginable to a commoner of the period. Other Empires grew ever more jealous and dared challenge the might of the Empire now spanning over a great reach of the globe. Small skirmishes for Britain were great wars for other countries. Europe and parts of Russia were lost. Once a peaceful Empire, now consumed by a ravenous apatite for all known land.

America, a newly formed country was at the time the last bastion of the civilised world not yet controlled by Britain. Vast fleets were contracted over a 60 year span, the day came when Operation Tea Party was launched.  Somewhat of a Colonial Blitzkrieg ensued. America fell in a matter of years.

its the most advanced time period a game is based of ever.
the combat is a bit different as well as ranged battles became almost the 
absolute of the warfare (suits the time period well wich is nice).
about the period I gotta say it was all made really great, everything
from the industrialization wich is present to the american revolution,
everything is quite accurate. 
ill switch now to a more short, summorized review.

POSITIVES:
-Graphics are great considering it was made in 09.
-UI is well placed and designed, really in the spirit of the period.
-Sound is okay, outstanding in battle.
-Music is great and well placed.
-Combat is great but...

NEGETIVES:
-...Sieging is the worst ever in a Total War game.
-Sometimes will crash, corrupt save files and glitch out.
-Tutorial is somewhat of a drag and uninspiring.

1. Cannot multitask - if I close the window I need to close the game and reset - wtf? That alone is brutal. 
2. Troops ignore commands at key moments, for example firing in lines is fairly straight forward - hold the line, fire reload, don't start turning around to face the other way and then get charged by cavalry (tried with or with guard mode - no wavering, losses or problems). 
3. (this one is personal preference) hate that fact it's spread over various continents but some may enjoy that. Pick one, and stick to it. 
4. Compared to Shogun 2 and Medieval 2, this is far from my favourite (but still better than most other TWs).  Why? The AI is just ridiculous perhaps it is totally essentially to use Darthmod.  

Areas it does well are:
1. It's a key period of history that was a power struggle for the mega powers and the lead up to 'Western Civilisation' along with capitalism.
2. If and when it works it is beautiful with high graphics, the musket smoke to cannon fire - a beautiful game.

Long review: This game is packed with stuff to do. And you are having fun doing those things. The thing I have noticed in this game though, when compared to Napoleon: Total War, this game has some glitches that N:TW doesn't have, but N:TW has some glitches that work perfectly in this game. For example shooting artillery with your infantry. In N:TW those things seem to absorb all the shots, while in E:TW you can shoot artillery with your muskets. 

There are some other things in E:TW such as:
1) Lags sometimes during battles, even though your PC specs are way over recommended.
2) Sometimes infantry will not shoot even within range WITH fire at will enabled and they have ammo

Look. If you like TW games, you need to have this one. BUT make sure this isn't the first Total War game you play, because it might be confusing at some times. 
This Total War is one of my personal favorites despite some of these glitches.

79,18438410,english,"Before I start off this review, I just want to say that I've always been a fan of anything RTS, and I have been interested in this video game genre for as long as I can remember. Another thing, Empire: Total War was my first Total War game I ever played. Initially, after playing the game for a few hours, I was somewhat confused because I usually played real-time strategy games such as Stronghold, Age of Empires, and similar titles. Although confused at first, since Empire: Total War was turn-based and focused more in-depth on economic & government management, I was not disappointed whatsoever. In fact, I honestly enjoyed playing this game very much and I still do. I recall purchasing this game when it was on sale along with the full DLC bundle. I honestly can say that the various DLC that is available for this game is definitely worth your money. Before I continue, I am going list the pros and cons of this game.

Pros:
-Fairly large campaign map. The campaign map (excluding the American Revolution campaign), includes the regions of Europe, North Africa, India, North America, Northern South America & the Caribbean. However, there are minor trade areas such as the Ivory Coast, far eastern Asia, Madagascar, etc...
-There are many playable factions that are featured in this game. These factions include Great Britain, France, Austria. Spain, the Ottoman Empire, and much more. There are also many 'emergent' factions that are basically nations that are created whenever certain provinces revolt, such as Hungary or Ireland. 
-Implements historical references through the use of short articles  (This might be more of a personal preference of mine, but as somebody who looves history, I've always found the historical implemented articles interesting.) Another thing, these historical articles pop up throughout the vanilla campaign as in-game years advance. 
-There are many unique and fun mods that you can download. These mods include Darthmod (my personal favorite), the civil war mod, and much more. I definitely recommend you to check out these mods. 
-The in-game real-time battles can be very engaging. These battles can either be naval or land, however, they are very interesting to see and participate in, especially when you play multiplayer matches. 
-The soundtrack accurately fits the game. I've always found the soundtrack during the campaign soothing and calm, and warlike during battles respectively. 
-The multiplayer aspect of this game is good at best. Although not very crowded with players, whenever you do join a multiplayer match, you and your opponent generally feel competitive and focused.
-Although the governmental and economic managing may be confusing at first, especially if you aren't familiar with this type of RTS, you will eventually get the hang of it. The managing aspect isn't a very difficult concept to understand.

Cons:
-During battles and sometimes during campaigns, you might run into a few bugs here and there. 
-The AI during battles might be an annoyance from time to time. These annoyances include not reacting to your orders, not responding to enemy fire, and basically being bullet sponges. These annoyances are often an occurrence during large fortress battles.
-The campaign AI, such as other factions, may do random actions, such as invading an isolated province far away from their own nation without any real reason. This is especially evident with the Maratha Confederacy, as they tend to become pretty powerful during the vanilla campaign if they are isolated long enough, and this faction tends to invade provinces far away. Although I do not expect this game to be totally historically accurate throughout the campaign, I've always found it funny and somewhat annoying whenever the Maratha Confederacy, an Indian faction, invade Rupert's Land in North America. 

So there it is, my pros and cons of this game. Please take note that many of these pros and cons apply to the vanilla game (without mods). I highly recommend buying this game if you are into turn-based strategy and real time battles. This game is definitely worth the current price it is being sold for.",1444624976,1499821954,True,0,0,0,8,True,False,False,76561198084757744,78,5,33656,506,19753.0,1601150355

The game almost requires some mods to fix these problems but when it is fixed the game feels a lot better.

This game is horribly broken, atleast in my few hours of experience.

I'm not referring to gameplay mechanic or anything like that, that's all well in hand. The thing that kills it for me is the astoundingly horrible AI and crashes/freezing. So I'll go over the good and the bad (Atleast in my opinion).

THE BAD

The AI: It's bad, it's just bad. Keep in mind I've clocked 200+ hours in M2TW and the AI there is bad. The AI immediatly wages war against everything around it, which isn't bad, the problem is everyone is your ally and youre always inclined to help them.  The problem, the ally AI ALWAYS loses, as Britain, both the United Provinces and Portugese were destroyed in a matter of turns when I went to war with them. And keep in mind you remain at war even if you're far away from the enemy faction. Arranging peace I'll get too. But the AI is just outrageously horrible, letting you go nearly anywhere and getting BS forces from nowhere.


Diplomacy: It's worse than M2 standards. Want peace? Too bad, even if theyre down to one province and under siege, they'll want all your colonies. Example; At war with Maratha, offer peace in exchange for some tech and money (No territory owned by me in India keep in mind), what do they do even though it is a useless war? Want Parts of Canada and the Carribean. CANADA AND THE CARRIBEAN, AND THEY'RE BASED IN INDIA!!! Like wtf AI. This makes it impossible tomake peace in these useless wars as you can never bribe them. They either flat out refguse or give you terrible demands, this goes for any other diplomacy.


Freezing/Crashing: Maybe this is just a problem with muy toaster, but every few turns the game will crash or freeze, forcing me to shut down my computer and log back on. Not much else to say.


The Music: Coming from M2TW, I guess I expected grand battle themes, but nope, just some quiet none fun ones.

----------------

THE GOOD

Politics: Love itm, civilian anger to taxes, revolutions, changing governments, it's wonderful as a mechanism to remind you of internal threats. Elections are random, so you may get good, bad, or meh mebers of government, but whatever.

Gameplay Mechanics: Battles are done fairly well and can be engaging in situations such as sieges or big engagements, but small engagements aren't as fun.

Other Bits: The little trinkets of history, economy and other things are also very fun bits to learn about and play around with.

Tech Tree: A bit annoying but great feature to decide what to focus on (Military, farming, philosophy).

----------

Summary: Overall Empire is a meh game for me, the upsides are negated by the problems with it to me, and I find it only enjoyable in small doses. I would recommend it to anyone interested in the time period (18th Century).

I suppose I'll continue playing it irregularly but not as often as I'd like.

54,18913930,english,"Beneath all the features and complex game mechanics, Empire remains a mix of turn-based empire building and real-time strategy, these two elements kept separate but affecting each other throughout the game. In the one half, you're developing your cities, raising and moving armies and sending out agents to spy, sabotage or steal technology on your behalf. You also have to maintain diplomatic relations with allies and rivals, steer scientific progress to develop new military, social and technological assets, and ensure that your economy remains headed in the right direction. When conflict rears its ugly head - and inevitably it will - it's time for the other half of the game to take over. This is the 3D real-time strategy that you'll remember from previous Total War games or the BBC programme Time Commanders; a fast-paced, realistic simulation of warfare featuring dozens of units and thousands of men on the field at any one time.


It's a mix designed to satisfy would-be Bismarcks and would-be Napoleons, and the game cleverly allows you to play the way you like best. Handling both portions gives you the full, rich Total War experience, but if you want to let the AI handle the management of the economy and the society, you can. If you want to let battles resolve themselves and concentrate on the political drama, then that's fine too. If you want, you don't even have to spend a second in the central 'Grand Campaign'; you can just set up your own battles or play the pre-defined scenarios, and just enjoy the sounds of booming cannon, musket-fire and clashing steel.

67,32139890,english,"Empire is definitely one of my favourite titles in the Total War series but for a lot of TW gamers I talk to they don't often understand why. Empire ranks fairly low in terms of reception alongside other contemporary titles despite being the only TW game set in the Georgian era. I'm going to avoid doing a huge broad review of the game, and instead focus on two points I'd like to raise for the new player:

1) The battle engine

This gets a lot of hate right off the bat. Essentially, before Empire if you charged two units of infantry together in any preceding game they would smush into a realistic mass and start going to town on one another. If four of your guys surrounded one of the enemy, they would all attack together and punch his lights out. Since the Warscape engine was introduced with Empire, the combat is reduced to kill moves only. This means that only one soldier can kill any one other soldier at any one time, and it is based on pre-scripted and often quite lengthy kill moves. Combine this with a very badly-designed unit collision system? If you look at a melee battle, it's like watching Cheerios with ADHD fight for control of the milk.

Empire does reduce this impact somewhat. With the basis being on firelock warfare above everything else, the vast majority of your battles on this game are going to be conducted at range with the major exception of cavalry charges. The engine is nowhere near as prominent in this scenario, and I actually think the musket volleys look great when they pick out six or seven blokes from across the enemy's front line. I cannot excuse the melee though, it just looks awful.

2) Campaign Diplomacy

The campaign itself was a lot of fun for me. I found the politics system a little dry and underused, but aside from the occasional spot of lag the campaign map was by and large really enjoyable. I have played a Swedish and Prussian game recently and really enjoyed both aside from one thing: the diplomacy.

The diplomacy makes no sense. The AI factions ask for backwater regions all the time, they refuse alliances and trade agreements for no good reason, the factors influencing international reputation are incredibly difficult to manipulate and almost impossible to move back to positive/negative after they have gone too far in either direction and above all it just lacks any kind of logic and breaks the immersion. 



There are tons more pros and cons to the game, but I felt I'd keep my review nice and concise and focus on the two biggest deal breakers for me.

70,32119768,english,"This is widely criticized as one of the buggiest titles in the series and often called one of the worst overall. I wholeheartedly disagree with the latter.

While this title is certainly buggy at times, it performs very well and provides some of the most entertaining total war battles to date. The naval battles are second only to Napoleon (and to be honest I didn't really put much time into Napoleon so I really should not count that title). The land battles are capable of being incredibly large and exceptionally exciting. The AI isn't the best in the series but I find it good enough to provide a challenge.

Overall, the game looks and sounds great. The game may crash on rare occasions as many games will eventually do but this one has a greater tendency to run for hours without trouble on all of the systems I have ever played it on. The game's DLC isn't all that great but what really matters is the base campaign which is awesome fun.

Compared to other games in the series, this one has the largest playable campaign map with regions stretching as far west as the American mid-west and as far east as India. The naval battles are so good you will actually WANT to play them...most of the time...they will admittedly get a big tedious later on when you have 20 or more ships under your command.

Overall I feel this game is largely over-criticized because it was the first in the series built on the newer game engine which frustrated a lot of the old school fans.

I have to say I am enjoying it so far ! I have not gone too deep on the grand campaign but I am very impressed visually with the campaign map . IMO the most attractive map In the total war series. Not to mention you can actually travel and conquer most of the world !! The animation and graphics are spot on. The battle sequences are completely different . It's more ""strategic"" and I love watching my soldiers in a musket battle. The siege battles are very realistic looking and the naval battles are great. Now the battles may be a bit Grindy, especially the naval battles. Also I think it's disappointing that you can't play any minor faction grand campaigns. Have to look into mods. Overall aside the negative reviews I personally have enjoyed this game thus far and looking forward to diving deeper and conquering the ""world"" in a campaign .!

Pros
-great battles , naval and field. 
-visually stunning  campaign map 
-diplomacy is a huge step in right direction

-can't play minor factions campaign vanilla

Empire: Total War is a turn based strategy game with realtime battles. When you start, you take control of a few main countries of that era, during the years around 1700 AD. You can play on North America, Europe, North Africa and India. 

Empire is one of the most ambitious TW titles with its huge map(s) and features from Rome and Medieval 2. I enjoyed american campaign and indian warpath or european contries as well. On the other hand, the ambition is its own downfall as it the big map feel kinda empty and sometimes a bit wrapped things around some core ideas are better than this goulash of all things that were good in previous titles. 
Also I highly suggest using some mods especially focusing on AI tweaking such as Darthmod etc., AI in this game is actually worse than in Medieval and its probably biggest minus of this title.

++ Musket era
+ Graphics. For such old title it still looks more than decent.
+ Gameplay and historic events.
+ Massive map.
+ Nice and long research tree. Fire by rank looks great btw.
+ Colonies. Being able to conquer most of the world.
+ Interesting campaigns.
+ Multiplayer. Community over this game is still alive.
+- Similar UI like in Medieval II ""classic"", might feel outdated for some people.
-- AI
- Reinforcing lost men in units for money. I see why this feature was changed in later installments.
- Dificulty. Game is rushing you to progress faster (time is the issue) but both campaing and battle AI is horrid without mods. Very hard's not making much sense since its just alienation of all your neighbours and AI cheats more with money.
- No option for making protectorats (Napoleon TW feature)
- Graphical glitches

The game is a real advance in the Total War series. The quality of grafics both on a strategic map and on a battlefield is impressive. The 18th cenury is a period of the rapid development of technological progress, so you'd better pay attention to this important issue during the game, otherwise your enemies would become more technologically advanced and sooner or later you would get into a big trouble. The times of brave knights in full armour, undisputable advantages of heavy cavalry on the battlefields have gone. Now new tactics rule the show, and there is a new belle in this bloody ball and its name is line infantry. And do not forget to protect your ports and trade rutes and for this you would have to maintain a powerfull fleet.

Naval combat didn't do it for me at all, I just autoresolved all of them after a while.

Land combat is a bit too easy, even on very hard. With 8 units of line infantry, 2 units och cavalry and a few cannons you'll beat any enemy army, even if they outnumber you by a 1000.

Late game is not nearly as fun as early game, when there's basically just 5 nations left.

Diplomacy is a bit weird at times. Why would a tiny Italian city-state like Venice declare war on the mighty Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth when it stretches from the Barents Sea to the Mediterranean Sea? Come on, guys.

11,31383984,english,"Oh, Empire! How I hate loving you. I have ploughed many hours in to this game, and honestly I'm not sure why. Actually I am sure why: long, very long, turn times. Even on decent hardware it takes an age for AI factions to complete their turns, which often kills any enjoyment early in a campaign, and as with most campaigns you will want to play through to the year 1800 for victory, that means 200 long waits. If you're in for the long hall, bring some work with you, or just have a kettle nearby as you'll have plenty of time to get on with other things or make a nice cup of tea while you wait. 

That being said, I have enjoyed this game. I love the time period, and it is certainly ambitious as the campaign allows you to battle over multiple continents and grow a truly global empire for your faction. Being British, I also loved the addition of naval combat and the chance to role out First Rate Ships-of-the-Line and wreak merry mayhem across the seas. There is a lot to like about deploying your troops to America and slashing through hordes of Native Indian tribesmen, or establishing a trading post in India and then having to repulse waves of marauding Mughals as you try to set up your tea plantations and secure your trade routes. However, there is also a lot not to like about useless AI that really can't handle large infantry formations, weirdly missing features (such as a family tree, or commanders with personality), uninteresting siege battles, and odd bits that should never have made it passed the Beta testing, like the fact that you can't repair damaged city defenses. 

All of these can be fixed with Mods (DarthMod being the go-to), and there is enough here to warrant a recommendation, but it is a close call. The Creative Assembly team dropped many balls with this one, and showed the kind of complacency that reared its ugly head again in Rome II. I do hope they re-visit this time period, and ultimately this game with a Napoleon Total War facelift would be fantastic. If you want to enjoy truly global empire building then dive in, but at a low price as the game is likely to frustrate.

I've put thousands of hours into rome 1 and Shogun 2. Most of them were played on the lowest settings on an old mac before I built my PC, so I'm VERY familiar with the general weirdness of total war AI. Empire takes every weird bug and turns it up to 11. Units won't fire when they're obviously in range. (Yes I know how line of sight works) Movement orders over bridges will often send your units halfway across the map to cross in the shallows. Attack orders can end in a unit casually strolling towards the enemy only to reform at the wrong angle. 

Seige battles especially are almost unplayable. Units will not fire off the walls correctly, cannons will not target walls correctly. Good luck trying to order your units through the right holes in the wall, they will just run off to a different side of the fort taking fire.

There's so much potential for an amzing game here but the clunkiness brings it down to the worst Total War game I've ever played. There's no single glaring flaw but the exceptionlly stupid AI makes you micromanage your units constantly. If you don't they will end up taking a route you didn't want them to, getting stuck on terrain or taking casualties you didn't deserve. Nothing is worse than having units get destroyed just because they didn't do what you wanted them to.

I used to think the matchlock units in shogun 2 were bad but now they control buttery smooth compared to Empire. Do yourself a favor and get Napolean (I haven't played but hear it's a lot smoother) or  Fall of the Samurai if you want guns in your total war.

47,26079092,english,"As someone who has been traditionally partial to medieval armour, weapons, and aesthetic, I originally didn't think style of warfare in the early modern period or the ""Black Powder"" style of warfare prominent in the 17th and 18th centuries was particularly fascinating and appealing. This was largely due to the inaccurate portrayal of the grim realities of warfare in contemporary period works at the time. however, as a history major who became acquainted with enthusiasts, connoiseurs, and aficionados of this style of warfare. it was their presence which inspired me to take the time to learn about the politics, warfare, society, and culture of the 17th and 18th centuries. it was through my studies that I came to understand how intense the aesthetic and experience of warfare was during the early modern period of european history. most artistic interpretations by the period of warfare's contemporaries as well as much of our modern interpretations of this style of warfare in both games and films make little effort in the way of expressing the visual, physical, and emotional brutality and intenseness that many young men and seasoned veterans had to face in the early modern period. 

advancements in military technology such as those made in firearms and artillery transformed the face of warfare forever as opposed to the melee and armourcentric style of warfare that happened in the middle ages and the renaissance. Thus, with these new technological advancements came new, and might i argue, scarier and more visceral kinds of human cruelties and brutalities that made fighting and killing far in excess of the limits of the raw powers of the human body. The human element of warfare was also highly elevated in response to these new evolutions in the nature of warfare. with the advent of military drill and training, the physical and mental fitness and discipline of the soldiers of this period were arguably superior to the serjents, men at arms, archers, and crossbowmen who peopled the infantry of the medieval era. with the exception of the aristocratic knights who were trained from birth to be expert killers and equipped with the finest weapons, armour, and mounts. medieval infantry to the best of scholarly observation and research were fairely weaker and undiscplined in contrast to the line infantry and footmen of the early modern period, who were typically organized into a line of battle and were expected to depend on discipline and sheer individual courage to hold the line of battle in the face of opposing firepower. 

However, the novelty that I came to appreciate most about the warfare and military aesthetic of this time period was the surprising amount of melee and close combat that was used in this battle, with the development of the lighter, more efficient flintlock muskets and the extinction of renaissance ""Pike and Shot"" formations in favour of the plug bayonets and their later innovations. regiments of line infantry would often resort to close combat or melee, which would remain strategically and tactically sound both as a means to save ammunition and fight on terrain where ""The lne of fire"" would be a strategically unfeasable means to fight an opponent, such as the narrow corridors of an urban settlement, strategic bottlenecks like the crossing of a bridge or the breach of a fortress, or even certain narrow and uneven terrain where froming a line of attack would be impossible due to the strategic limitations of the terrain. The other occasion where close combat and melee would also remain in a position of strategic and tactical importance in this age of warfare would be through the use of cavalry. while black powder warfare would influence the strategic and tactical use of cavalry with smaller firearms such as carbines and pistols, close combat cavalry charges with ""cold steel"" such as sabres and lances would continue to be the weapons and tactics of choice for many, if not most generals in the 17th and 18th centuries. 

This understanding of the strategic and tactical importance of close combat and melee in early modern warfare would be enough to spark my enthusiasm for both the warfare and history of this time period. however, in coming to understand the aesthetic innacuracies of modern portrayals of medieval soldiers and warriors. i have come to realize that the rise of standard issue military uniforms is a novelty of early modern european warfare in this time period. and thus, military attire of this period was both aesthetically superior to all its predecessors from the medieval and classical periods, and would remain the alltime epitome and gold standard of military attire that would serve as the foundation and inspiration of later forms of military uniform.

Lastly, Through my personal understanding of the military expoits of the French Emperor and General Napoleon Bonaparte and his experiences leading french armies during the revolutionary and napoleonic wars. I have come to believe, taking into consideration napoleon's love for classical greek and roman military history as well as his mathematical expertise in understanding the nature of probability and calculated, strategic planning. That the individual tactics and overall military strategy of the black powder warfare of the 17th and 18th centuries centuries are largely inspired by scholarly research and understanding of military warfare as practiced by the ancient greeks and romans. The rennaissance, or the beginning of the early modern period in the 15th century was marked by an intense fascination and study of classical texts from ancient greece and rome. while originally preserved and interpreted by the literati of the roman catholic church, a growing secular interest and interpreation of these ancient texts was beginning to take prominence amongst the scholarly community of the renaissance onwards which would affect and improve all manner of life and society, and warfare and combat were no exceptions from this advancements made in the study of these antiquated texts. the organization, structure, tactics, and strategic docrines of the black powder warfare the 17th and 18th century were arguably inspired by scholarly research and interpration of greek and roman military treatises and manuscripts as well as the personal military exploits by classical greek and roman generals like Julius Caesar, Alexander the Great, and Leonidas. Both the Impact and influence such texts would have on the developments of early modern warfare would be epitomized in Napoleon's battles such as rigoli, austerlitz, and liepzig, and toulon where application of the principles behind Spartan, Macedonian, and Roman military tactics would would result in triumph for napoleon and the french empire that would result in france being the first european country to dominate europe since ancient rome. Due to the multitude and the genius of napoleon's many military victories, his battles and military exploits would continue to be studied in the presitigious setting of military academies to this very day, and the accounts of napoleons military triumphs and those of generals like him, as well as the treastises and manuscripts by military theorists of the time such as carl von clausewitz would serve as the foundational material for which all aspiring military officers to this very day continue to study as a means of developing a knowledge base for military thinking.

In conclusion to all my points. My studies of the politics, warfare, and military theory of the early modern period have opened me to chossing this game as my alltime favourite total war game. even moreso than medieval II total war, my traditional favourite of which I have spent 2000 or so hours on. For all of you who enjoy swords, armour, and melee, and hack and slash style rpg and action games, I wouldn't recommend this game to you unless you have the openness and curiousity to learn about and appreciate the political and military history of this time period.",1476658352,1491459270,True,10,1,0.635015249252319336,2,True,False,False,76561198022316358,336,1,37191,0,20509,1598129439

Turn times start out taking a few seconds, and within 30-40 turns it devolved into literally 8-10 minutes staring at the screen. I spend time between every turn playing guitar and staring at the screen...waiting. The bug is due to the Ottomans spamming multiple single unit armies near a certain land bridge, clogging up the AI because, for some reason, CA decided that even when AI units are not visible (and I check the box that said do not show AI movement) the AI still moves EVERY one of them, in a queue of first-in, first-out order.

The setting: The move to a primarily firearm based era makes this Total War different from the others. While at first it is a refreshing change, it gets a little old after a while. This style of warfare relies a lot more on standing around and blasting each other with artillery and a lot less on charging into melee. Most battles play out in a similar fashion.

Naval combat: While the first addition of naval combat is exciting, it is rather slow placed. It can be tough to get the hang of, but is still fun to watch!

Campaign: This is where the game excels. The grand campaign in this iteration offers lots of new options, like rebellions, protectorates that actually do something, and a more intricate trade system. No real downsides here!

Overall, a good game. Still crashes to the desktop occasionally, so get used to hitting quicksave.

One last pet peeve. The implementation of forts is completely broken, making them a liability more than a bonus.

While the introduction of naval battles were great ideas and gun powder battles in general are great fun, I have never had a worse experience than this with any Total War game. Not even Rome II at it's release was as buggy as Empire still is today. After playing Empire for 42h I can easily say Empire Total War has the worst AI in any game of the series. 

So far I've seen the AI defending a fort by assembling all it's troops in the center the fort, allowing my men to climb the walls and kill all of them without taking a single hit.

Even deadlier for the AI's troops and yours as well is walking stairs. I can't describe how often I've seen soldiers getting off a fort wall via a staircase simply fall over and die by the hundreds. Once they reach the bottom of the staircase they just fall over, without taking any hits. Hundreds of dead bodies on a single spot. This bug wasn't even fixed in Empire's sequel/standalone addon Napoleon Total War. In fact this even happened to me more frequently there. 

This is gamebreaking and it's unbelievable how these bugs still haven't been fixed.

Although it came out awhile ago, its graphics are not terrible by any means, and as you can see from my own play time:  It's a favorite.
 I also nominated this game for the ""Game within aa Game"" award, because it really does feel like two different games. One momment your in the cannon smoke filled fields being a Genearl and master tactician of troops, and in another you are a King:  Whose will is absolute and you have a wide range of abilities that factor your economy, your peoples opinion of you, espionage, research, infastructure, and of course building and maintaining an army (Their expensive by the way)

Only downside is that Sea warfare is kinda tricky, but the graphics and simiulations of boarding another's ship and claiming her for your own is very satisfying. ;)

The game is mostly well-balanced, the firearms bring an extra dimension (tactical combat phase isn't just mindless melee) and the three theatres (Europe, India, Americas) provide varied approaches to the Grand Strategy. Exchanging broadsides in naval combat is also very well done.

18th century is well represented and the different units (line and light infantry, light and heavy cavalry, dragoons, cannons, howitzers etc.) are interesting. You can play as a historical European superpower like France, Prussia, Austria, Sweden or Poland-Lithuania or choose the Ottoman Empire or the India-based Marathas. The United States has her own campaign, as well as the Native Americans. Regarding the learning curve for new players, this isn't a walk in the park but not a minute-detail micromanagement hell either.

Only serious downsides are that the AI and unit pathfinding are at times bit lacking but otherwise this is a very engaging and entertaining game. Highly recommended.

A little bit of an update

The huge expansive area to conquer is amazing! While if you are a European power Europe may seem scaled down a lot in comparison to other Total War game, your focal point would be the other continents and claiming those territories, this makes for a stretched out but enjoyable game. with events and technological research to keep things fresh and not as boring, as well as trying out the different and underdeveloped countries allowing for multiple playthroughs, thats excluding the mods :D and lets not forget about the new naval battles which work fine and more involvement with ships and trade, their are so many things to talk about with this game i hope a bigger and more ambitious Empire 2 is in the making.

However one flaw i do find the game to have is the limited town growth, as no matter how big a small one you'd find will get, you will never unlock other building types which can be a bit frustrating, plus the AI being stupid which is to expect but luckily not as bad as Medieval II's gun powder units.",1404202052,1479941928,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198068799211,543,51,12394,0,6958,1512156997

Yeah Empire TW is buggy and glitchy game, but at least a better than Rome 2. but still, This game make me can't stop to continue turn after turn in the campaign. This game gave best expirience after you get your goal. The odd statisfying aftertaste. Especially if you have Warpath campaign, that give you more whole new expirience but addiction if you get used to and find your way how to fight. And if you have time on battle, spent some to zoom into soldiers and hear the voices


And Multi Player, sadly almost no player now. But if there's a player this game is nice. sometimes you can win bcoz correct using of one unit. all about timing.

For me, Empire: Total War is much better than any other Total War games. The reason why I picked this as the top of Total War is because the management is much easier to understand, the map is huge as shown from America to India.

98,26242482,english,"Note: I only run one mod! It sort of alters my review.. for the better IMHO! Well anyway, its more-or-less a community patch that fixes many complained about aspects of the vannila version and tweaks certain gameplay mechanics for the better. It also alters some minor campain cosmetics, and adds a TON of very usefull, realistic different units which add to each faction's uniqueness even more! 

The mod is called DarthMod Empire 8.1 and I totally recomend it as well!


Now... the review:

Before Steam, I played the vanilla version for well over 300 hours, 99% singleplayer. For whatever reasons Total War MP doesn't do it for me like say.. Age of Empires 2 MP does.

This is my favourite game out of the Total War series, often taking the spot as my favourite strategy game in general. I love the scale of it all. One can really get satisfied by upgrading and fighting for your distant colonies! This game is HUGE! Playing the ""Grand Campain"" on ""World Domination"" mode may take 10+ hours to fully complete. The sea battles are hard, but very fun! Managing an armada is quite a task, hopefully you've done the proper research! The race against other faction's scientific clocks is on, as Empire lets one build schools and send schollarly gentlemen to research new technology!

If you're a fan of previous Total Wars, you might be overwhelmed with all the new features and mechanics, but TRUST ME it will grow on you!

If this is your first Total War game, you're in for one heck of an experience as well!

Once you see the whole mini-map one solid color, and that color is your factions color, you will share the same satisfaction I have gotten many a time from Empire!",1477557687,1477557687,True,5,0,0.563492059707641602,0,True,False,False,76561197989403490,121,7,8359,0,4223,1591642713

25,25759846,english,"This game is definitely the worst installment in the Total War series, and I will still recommend it. While the AI has no direction and almost no idea on even what it is doing, while the game tries to take on too much, and while the game falls short in giving the player a different experience for every different faction Empire: Total War is still a good game. Something about conquering the british empire as the Maratha Confederacy (the indians) is so damn rewarding.
(TL;DR)=game with many flaws, large and small, but can be enjoyable, and then some with mods

The best addition to this game that was not present in previous Total War games is the technology tree. It perfectly showcases how advances in civil sciences were similar to a double edged sword

The next best addition is the amount of the Earth is playable.
-naval battles will be fought all along the coasts of europe and the Mediterranean, the Ivory Coast, the East Indies, and in North America.
-land is conquerable across 5 continents: Europe, Africa, Asia, North America, and South America.

So let's start with the first problem you will notice in the game, the setting
    -The 18th century is the dawn of the industrial period and falls to the enlightenment age, but playing through all 100 years and the world stays almost the same.

The next worst part of the game is the AI. Have you ever watched a movie or played a game that was so bad you enjoyed it because of how much a joke it is, well the AI is exactly like that, except the joke is as bad as your father's
-cannot embark units
-has cavalry run straight at line infantry instead of artillery
-builds militia units
-fights with trading ships
-has no clue that there are 4 more continents other than the one it is on
    
next is the combat
-every match is won based on the amount of line infantry you have
-grenadiers are useless
-cavalry becomes obsolete late game
-pray to RNGesus 

4th are the units
-all line infantry are the same except for their colors
-Great Britain, France, Spain, Prussia, Austria, Poland and Lithuania, Russia, and Sweden use almost all the same units.
-no unit variety among european factions unless you buy DLC
-auxillary units are useless
-artillery has little variety besides the ball weight and the mobility

Lastly I'll talk about the naval aspect of the game
-creative assembly has never been boating before, and it shows
-naval battles are like watching turtles have sex
-same formula for winning in land battles; the more rate ships = the winner

the vanilla rating is 5/10. Some people will enjoy this, and some people will not, and the rest will get bored quick.
now the real way to play and enjoy this game is the darth mod, which adds much needed variety and spices and fills many glaring cracks the base game has.",1475119042,1475119042,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198061423768,237,4,24604,0,21210,1566851279

42,25575493,english,"Empire Total War is a great choice if you have an itch for Age of Sail/Gunpowder Era game play. For those of you whom may never have played a Total War title this next part is for you.

 Total War games are a mixture of 2 common Strategy Game mechanics. You have a campaign board and you have a RTS Battle Mode. For the camapign board think Sid Meyer's Civilization, you control the empires finances, build queues and unit movements in this mode. When you go to fight an enemy force you then go into a RTS mode where the armies involved fight on a map that represents your location on the campaign board. Example, if your forces engage the enemy in a forest then expect the battle mode map to be a forest. If you attack an enemy that is blocking bridge access to the other side on the campaign board you will have to fight accross that bridge in the battle mode map if you want to win. The opposite is true if you are defending. 

You can choose to automate nearly everything in this game, wether it be taxes, building queues or even land and sea battles. This makes it somewhat easier to learn the ropes of the game as it can be a bit overwhelming at first but I would suggest going straight for the deep end and learn how to do it all yourself.

Graphically the game looks great with maxed settings.

Audio seems legit most of time but every now and again i notice that some sounds vanish only to return later just as quickly as they left.

Quick note on pacing in the game, if you are new or just havent played in a while it can seem slow to start and in some ways it truly is. Trust that patience is a virtue in the early game because when the shiiyat hits the fan it will test you.

All in all i think Empire Total War is a great game and can certainly offer you many hours of enjoyment. I recommend this to anyone who likes strategy games and wants a colonial era setting in which to strategize.

The battle gameplay is also good, with a wide range of histrorically accurate units to choose from, with lends a very strategic element to each battle, as the player has to no how to counter the troops of the opposing side; a skilled player can gain victory over a numerically superior army.  The online gameplay is solid, with only occasional lag issues.  There are only a few minor downsides. There are occassional glitches and freezes (approximately one every fifty battles), Cavalry is very underpowered, which limits their effectiveness.  They are useful against unprotected artillery and countering other mounted units, but one small infantry group can rout a far larger cavalry force.  Finally, the general, while very important, has a limited range of gameplay options; the same level of morale is offered regardless of where the general is in relation to the rest of the fighting force, as long as if the general is alive or on the battlefield.

85,24911501,english,"I totally recommend this game. This is my favourite strategy game. I mean, I used to think that a strategy game should be like age of empires or, I don't know, like civilization. But combination of both real time strategy and turn based strategy makes perfect sense imo. I mean, I can't think any other way to create a strategy game anymore. Anyways, here is my pros and cons:
 Pros:
-Unique units for every nation and some certain regions,
-Unique naval units, well, not much but there are some.
-Unique tech trees for every nation,
-Unique buildings for every nation,
-Technologies and Buildings work together, i mean, you have to research a certain tech to unlock a certain building, and you have to build a certain building in order to unlock a new tech to be researched
-Trading system is nice, there are trading posts around the world that you can occupy and trade there,
-Diplomatic relations,
-Protectorates,
-Minor nations,
-Number of possible new nations,
-Voices of units are very good. Best part of the game is this. Sometimes, I wake myself up by repeating the voices of units :D
-Tactics in battles are really effective. If you count on your soldier number and go straight into enemy, you may get crushed. However, you can crush the enemy when you are outnumbered too.
-You can interact with surrounding in a battle,
-Naval Battles,
-Amount of detail of land and naval units,
-Historical accuracy.
-18th century, I mean, isn't it perfect? Colonization and stuff. I used to play Age of Empires 3 before ETW. But AoE3 has nothing even near to ETW, in my opinion of course...
-You can play online normal battles, naval battles, siege battles, siege defence battles etc.
 Cons:
-Lack of playable factions. You can't play as minor nations, i wish i could. I know you can, by changing stuff in the game folder, but i don't want that.
-AI gets really stupid and stubborn and jerk and selfish in diplomacy sometimes, but it is good in the battles
-Main storyline is short
-Your pc will get roasted if it is not really good. Or, at lower settings you will wish to get blind and never see something like that again.
-Religions, as an atheist, I don't like to convert people into christianism or islam or any of the other religions, but when you are playing the game you have to. Or the people will go rage mode and starts riots and burns down places or worse, they rebel and try to take away your regions etc.
-A lot of cool unique units are in the DLCs. But I don't judge, it's 2016 and every game developer does this. Bright side is the DLCs are not that expensive, i think that's something...
-Grand Campaign mode is not infinite. I would be great if it was, but then it would make no sense. I mean, how could using muskets and bayonets and horses make any sense at the year 2372?

Anyways these were my pros and cons. Like said in the beginning, I totally recommend this game. If you haven't played any of the Total War games, you cannot assume that you love strategy games, because you have never played a real one. The only strategy game i have ever played that is closest to this consept was Rise of Nations. But it wasn't quite enough. I think Total War games are the best strategy games so far. Empire TW was my first total war game and I think this is the the best Total War game, imo. I couldn't play newer Total War games though. Neither my economic currency nor my pc would let me do it. However, as far as I saw from Medieval TW, Rome TW, Medieval 2 TW and obviously Empire TW, Creative Assembly knows how to create a perfect strategy game and needs to be appreciated.

   Anyways, let me tell you how i felt when I first enter the game:
I always wanted to try a TW game, because a lot of people recommended it to me. One day I saw this game on Steam and I thought, ""Hmm.. A Total War game. Let's see..."" and I purchased this game. Then I entered the game. It seemed cool. Then I started the main story, Road to the American Independance. For the first 1-1.5 hours, I was like ""Dafuq has happened"", ""Dafuq was that"", ""Dafuq is this"", ""Dafuq do I do?"". Yeah I really was like that. But then I started to understand what is game all about.For the following 2-3 hours I was like ""Omg omg omg"", ""Shit this game is awesome!"", "" I will play this game until the death takes us apart!"". After I finished the main story, I started a Grand Campaign as Ottoman Empire [Because I am a ""Turkish Patriot"" (no i'm not, just kidding, but i love my nation and our history)] And it was so much different than American campaign. Then i see the variety in this game and I was like: "" OMG, i had no idea about this game, this game is much more awesome than i thought"". Then I kept playing this game, and the game kept getting even better. I still play this game without getting bored.
   
   So yeah, these were my opinions. I hope I did help you. Thank you for reading. Have a nice game!",1471181978,1471712729,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198129094785,117,8,16341,0,7449,1599141019

97,24833881,english,"Decided its probably time to give E:TW a review considering I played this for lord knows how many hours on disc before I ended up getting it on Steam.

So, is it any good? Short answer...Yeah.

Pros:
-Empire offers the biggest map (to my knowledge) out of most of the Total War games. Ranging from the Americas (North, the neighbouring islands, the head of South), Europe/North Africa, some of the middle east and India. There are also ship-only trade locations around indochina, africa and the americas which also add to the fun.
-Loads of factions.
-Even more emerging factions (All hail the might Norway which completely throttled my Russian Empire).
-Nice range of units even without the DLC.
-The Era itself is quite fun, this is the closest to a World War Total War game so its worth getting to try the vanilla version before getting the World War One mod.
-Revolutions give you the chance to revolt..more importantly the chance to change your nations flag color (Sorry Maratha, it sucks though.)

Cons:
-The diplomacy system..it just doesn't work. For example, Playing as Spain and all is going swell, offer trade with Persia. The game freezes for a moment and I wished it had of stayed frozen. Upon unfreezing, Persia demands 4 of my cities and offers 5 turns of military access....Why in the shit would I want to send troops to Persia?
-Copy Pasted villages. All the towns seem to look way too similar, I mean atleast in the American countryside the forests look different but other then that, it's like the Devs just kinda gave up.
-Stupid Units. Stupid. Stupid. Stupid. STUPID. Seriously, the amount of times my troops shoot their own soldiers, run back and forward when ordered to charge or just REFUSE to walk into a building is irritating.
-Rebellions. I mean, im a veteran at the Total War games, having played almost every one but I have to say, the rebellions in this seem more like the game going ""Meh, why not?"" than logical 'tax is too high' or 'religious unrest' rebellions that happen in other games. I've had cities on low tax, religious building with preachers, no schools or colleges and nice pleasure gardens and even had both low and high amounts of troops...rebellions just seem to happen for no reason and they can really mess you up.

I'd give the vanilla game a 5/10, it's not a bad game but it has its flaws that can almost derail any pros.

Pros
British people can earn a living from selling tea (win win win) 
American revolution can be crushed (like it should of)
British people can invision the world as we see it , owning every possiable space of land, making stong treaties with the Dutch (love you guys) and of couse rulling the waves :)

Cons 
Well sadly this game has many 'cons' and there is no way of avoiding it 
It is still extremely buggy ,the game has got less buggy from when it was released but this was released 2009
The time span of this game is very short lived  , no 1800's means no Africa and no Africa means British person cant get our vital minerals :( 
Multiplayer is a joke go play napoleon total war if you want to play multiplayer for a simlar time period
A lack of the British anthem was found in the game i had to create a playlist with all my fav imperialistic tunes to make sure in my head i rulled the waves
The religious feauture was a good concept but poor in game i hope if they redo a total war in 1700's era they really put a lot of effort into religion it was a key turning point of the time if you could have a religious peace you could controll a lot people

The gameplay itself can get repetitive overtime but still follows the format seen in all Total War games. Creative Assembly had done a good job in terms of historical accuracy and introduced me to different variations of troops seen during the 1700s. Compared to the other games, I can see where the hatred is coming from and I can see it for it's flaws but it does do what it is meant to do correctly.

24,24510570,english,"I've really enjoyed playing Empire: Total War.

It has the perfect balance between detail and size. Medieval II: Total War, for instance, has so much detail it's hard to look at.

But Empire is in that happy zone of size versus detail. It has great replay value, because of the level of gameplay details. At the same time, it doesn't get bogged down by virtue of being [i]too[/i] detailed. This keeps the gameplay moving. I find it particularly refreshing in a Total War title, since I love playing them but get tired of the later-game level of nation management. In short, it doesn't drag you down with administrative tasks as the game gets into the later stages. You can keep conquering enemy nations, instead of keeping your nation afloat with never-ending building management, like in the original Medieval: Total War.

The level of advice in the game is perfect for newbies, or for players returning after a long hiatus. It really holds your hand and shows you the ropes, all without being too intrusive. After you've wrung all you can from the advice, you can turn it down or off.

The new battle mechanics of using largely gunpowder troops is a switch for Total War. Of course, previous titles were dominated by hand-to-hand combat with pikes, swords, and the like. Lining up blocks of infanty, by contrast, may get boring after a while since it has less detail. But that depends on the type of player you are.

Instead of concentrating all of a province's buildings in the region capital, there are now buildings spread throughout the province. For instance, farms, universities, and industrial buildings are spread throughout the province. This makes the game more interesting to look at, since it isn't a meaningless landscape dotted with region capitals. It also gives an added stragegic element to the game: you can pillage these buildings, and thus remove the benefits they provide the other nation. For instance, you can pillage a university and thus take it out of action. It then can't do research for the nation you're fighting. These buildings can be repaired for cash in one turn. But still it puts a monkey wrench in the works, especially if it's an advanced building which is expensive to repair.

The different strategic regions (Europe, The New World, India) feel very balanced. It's especially fun to be fighting in North America around the time range of the American Revolution. India feels very boring, since it's basically an inverted triangle. But still, it has a meaningful level of detail to it. It doesn't just feel like a sideshow, though you can ignore it if you wish.

I like that you can send trading ships, called Indiamen, to different places in the world to bring back valuable resources. So for instance, you can dispatch an Indiaman to the west coast of Africa to bring back ivory for your nation to sell to other nations. It's a good source of income, and I like the reliability and simplicity of it. It's a [i]very[/i] nice touch.

Diplomacy has a good deal of detail. For instance, if you're allied to a nation, break your alliance with it and then attack it, you'll get a permanent negative rating with most of the nations of the world. They don't like treaty violators! It makes them think twice about engaging in any deals with you. So be careful who you ally with. Don't do it as a convenience which you intend to break 10 turns later. Additionally, there are ""historical grievances"" between different nations based on their actual history. So for instance, the United Provinces have historical grievances with Spain because of Spain's attempts to conquer the nation. It adds a nice amount of...landscape to diplomacy. It doesn't feel like you're all just a bunch of random nations dumped into an Earth-like arena with no background. It feels more like actual history.

Unfortunately, you can't play as the United States. I guess they thought that it would be impossible to make it into a meaningful power with any realism. Still, it would have been nice to try! So if you would like to have a part in American history, it will have to be secondary part. For instance, in my first campaign I was playing as Prussia and conquered Britain. This sparked the American Revolution by eliminating the Original Thirteen's rulers across the sea. So you can be involved, but only in a secondary way.

So if you like Total War games, and especially if you'd like one that moves a little faster than previous titles, give Empire: Total War a whirl!",1469411058,1469411058,True,3,0,0.56204378604888916,0,True,False,False,76561198045783066,105,15,1614,0,1571,1531974703

29,24439583,english,"I have recently completed the long campaign on the difficult setting as Britain.  I have also completed the independence campaign.  Although the game has been around for a long time I found it an asborbing experience to play and worth the large amount of time required to successfully complete the long campaign.   Having said that there are issues that detract from the game and these probably apply to the total war series in general.  Issues that have been mentioned in other reviews include the inappropriate use of bomb ketches and rocket ships in naval battles.  Either they should not have been included in the game or the ability to have coastal battles and sieges in which these ships could have been used should have been developed. Puckle guns are another unit mentioned before that were not actually used in the era and therefore should probably not have been included.  Going back to the idea of coastal sieges Marine units might have been an interesting addition to the game and created a bit more diversity in the battle environments.

The battle experience could have been  improved by having some sort of smart setup option.  I often found I laid out my armies and fleets in the same way, dependent upon the landscape.  The ability of the game to remember  a preferred setup style and to vary it depending on the terriain could help save a lot of repetitive setup issues.  When it came to deciding battles against missmatched armies and fleets using the auto resolve often your troops ended up taking relatively heavy losses.  When your fleet came up a mismatched fleet often weaker fleet would be entirely  destroyed when it should probably have just been captured. It might have been good to have options on the auto-resolve to indicate tactics that your fleet or army could utilise that would lead to a lower loss of life or the capture of enemy vessels. This would cut down on the 'grind' of some of the battles.

The final issue that I felt could have been better was the 'end'. Just a fairly lame animation and that's that.  What I think alot of players of the Total War series would find really interesting would be a 'history' of their campaign sort of like at the end of a Civilisation game.  There could be a quick history that showed general information about your game play and other nations and a really detailed turn by turn game history that showed everything from the movement of individual units to general economic and social issues of each faction.  Notable battles could highlighted and replayed and pivotal movements could be highlighted.  This would be a rewarding experience for a player who has devoted a considerable length of time to playing.  It could also be used as feedback for the game developers to find out how the game is played and how it could be improved.  These 'histories' could even be shared and 'ranked' between players to create interest for different players to develop their tactics and strategies. Perhaps, there could also be a comparison with the actual events of the era.",1469095926,1469096152,True,0,0,0,1,True,False,False,76561198024016670,54,2,13840,0,13587,1586032724

31,24379636,english,"WARPATH:
There are a tremendous amount of quirks to this game that make it a pain in the neck.  Right when you start to have fun the game throws you a curveball such as: if you have an army that can't attack a city because it ran out of moves but you send a supporting army to join them, that part of the army WILL AUTOMATICALLY attack the city.  What the hell?  

You still get all your local forces in the battle but they join piecemeal and the enemy can cut you down before reinforcements come.  Nuts!  Just give me the option to hold position without attacking like in every other total war game!

Other quirks: cavalry will charge anti-cavalry barricades and all die even if there is a safe path several feet away, archers start with skirmish mode off, fire at will turns off unpredictably so your ranged units will just be standing there idly right as your big, well-planned engagement starts, sometimes archers have moved without orders so that they will be facing left, right, or rearward when the big engagement starts.  If you accidentally send orders to the wrong unit right before the big engagement, instead of halting when you press backspace, they will continue to turn around 180 degrees before resuming their original position, totally ruining your plans.

These wouldn't be big issues except 1) they weren't present in Medieval 2 and Rome 1 which were both not broken so why fix them? and 2) battles in Empire are decided much quicker and are much more decisive so that a chance right click which causes your archers to about-face will ruin not just your battle but your entire campaign!  Totally nuts!  Save a lot and be prepared not to have fun.

-A lot more difficult than previous Total War games
- Decetly realistic (Follows a historical timeline)
-No cheats, is cheating is desired have to go through a cheat engine
-Different dynamics than previous Total War Games

Pros:
-Larger map
-More countries to trade/ally with
-Ocean battles

Cons:
-No online campaign (Biggest heartbreak)
-Slower Army building
-Addicting
-factions randomly starting wars or leaving alliances (Blasted indians!)

56,23161688,english,"I'm rather new to the Total war series, but this game is a bit different. Please not the majority of the game I played using darthmod. 

It's one of those games you love, but you want to pick at it flaws because they could have been fixed.

Unlike the other total war's, your generals don't seem to play as important role. They don't have abilities to rally your troops, they do gain traits but you can't inspire a unit from breaking. For the most part if your soliders have ranked up they rarely break.

Units are pretty much standard across the board, Russia has a few different units and the Ottomen Empire and India centered states start out with swords and shields. Though they do have guns, they are horrible shots but make up for it in raw numbers. The DLC packs that have special units, aren't generally that special. A lot of them are just reskined units that aren't that good anyway. The Amazon female warriors who aren't on the main page for some reason, have the same stats as rangers.

While I'm on the topic of the Ottomen empire, you almost want to start a war with them becausethey have a land bridge, and for whatever reason during a turn it takes  them forever, where every other country takes less than a second to move and fight their fights.

I enjoy the battles, they are a lot of fun, though I would like to have seen some differences in units between America, England, and Spain. Some countries do have pikemen, depending what period you start, but they seem to ""go away"" as you advance...Which I would love a unit of pikemen to protect my cannons because most of the time it's the other side's cav who goes after your cannon.

Even with the darthmod upgrade to it's AI, it's still not the best. If your attacking a fort, which the second tier forts are sort of a waste because you can't get soilders into parts of the forts to fire the cannons, you can sit back and shoot lime shot from your cannons and just lay waste to the other side. After a few volly's from your cannons' you have killed hundreds upon hundreds of their soilders, and yet they just send more men on the wall.

Alliances don't mean anything in the game, I would go as far to say I don't want them, because if you break one everyone gets mad at you. If you are in an aliance with whoever, they don't rush to your aide. Like all the Total war games, they needed to include a way to tell your alliance to attack this region or send some troops to back me up.

The balance system of who is going to win is off, it's based on the ammount of soilders. If I have a cannon and 3 units of line soilders and a unit of Cav, Vs 2 units of Ottomen's swordsmen and one of their gun units along with a unit of their cav, they are going to have more soilders but I'm going to win that fight hands down. Let alone my cannon lowering their numbers, my soilders are going to get a few volly's off before the swordsmen can attack me, by than they will prolly break. Generally battles are on a much grander scale.

End battle? Shouldn't even be an option. After it's apparent you won a battle and the other side is leaving the battelfield, that's the time to utterly destory their army. 2-3 units of Cav or dragoons can destroy an army for good, more so with states like the Ottomen's or Martha's who have a high soilder count.  Your Cav ends up killing more soilders than anything else.

I know it sounds like I'm beating up on the game, but I really do enjoy it

Besides, I don't like the fact that all the american indians and the mughals are locked out in campaign.

I lost a lot of guys and he lost a lot of the guys. But in the end I made a counter attack and assasinated the general behind. After clearly, I won the battle I clicked quit battle. I lost for some reason. I don't want to wait an insanely retarded amount of time waiting for the british to route out of the map. Seriously. The AI in seige is STUPID. It camps on the walls when clearly the walls are going to collapse and they die with the wall. The AI on land, flanks his entire fucking army around your army, so your having to go sideways and he still is trying to flank you. I get small flanks and retreats but flanking your entire army?!! Also, the mentally challenged AI will put is army in front of the charge and if you fire your artillery he will retreat and go back repeating the process.

Friendly fire is all too common, and you sometime lose more troops from that then enemy fire. Siege battles are a joke, and troops are pretty glitchy while using fortifications.

Gameplay-
But to be a bit more in depth the game  play is you saw in the  movie The Patriot, but sadly none of your troops will fire until all and I mean all your small troops are in formation, so those pesky cavalry will probably beat you before your men will fire their musket. The AI of your men and others can be realistic, but as you you play you've probably be noticing dumb pathfinding and enemy charges where they suddenly stop and stand in the middle of a firing line getting shot at from your own line. But as for many units they can be retarted when shooting there own friendly infantry squad if they're in front of them, or when cabaneer cavalry shoot the enemy infanrty but when the range cavalry shoot with other cavalry in front charging them, it will instead hit the friendly units instead. Sadly a recurring problem in Shogun 2 Fall of The Samurai. But when it does suceed is the excellent action that suceed as your own men or the enemies can rout or shatter if lose of men, or fatigue to just lose of morale.

Diplomacy-
As for diplomacy, since it was my first time ever playing this series, thank gosh that most of the awful bugs that made it a bad Total War game bad, has mostly dissipated. And the diplomacy is bare ground good. But I would recommend downloading darthmod for every single Total War game to fix many issues since the game releas, I defenitely recommend since it fix most of the annoying things like the AI not counter offering you in dipolatic trade. And for most of the time the diplomacy hangs to what the countriess would be if you were( But I didn't remember there to be betraying Mexicans.) But nonetheless the taxes and working to see which is worth more to be tedius, but managing. Just be ready for the rebelling British in London to keep pushing and pushing the capital when you play as French.

Mulitplayer-
Sadly since there are merely a sum of a few good men playing this marvelous game, I seem to not be able play it at all nonetheless the single player campaign in addicting with the one-more-turn that these game are known for. And trust me the second I played isn't even finish. So hope that the rebelling Brish people will finnaly die.

Summary 
In short the game is modded enough and polished with patches that is as playable as Rome Total War 2 which is now amazing, but people perspective.

Overall score 3/10

This game plainly capitalizes on the success of previous releases. First time for me when CA seriously dropped the ball, but the more I play it the more I realize I should have had a refund.

Positives
The game looks good when zoomed in.
New game mechanics in advanced trade, multi warzones around the globe. Sea combat. New nations.

Negatives
Feel: Maybe it is the period, but all European nations feel totally the same. Other than that nations have specific end buildings in capitals which helps with the immersion.
Fights: 0/10 to AI quality.
Pathfinding is abismal.
You attack a unit infront of you, and your guys start running away (not retreating, or fleeing, running away from their goal.) Worse is, if you click right behind the enemy, they run towards the point without an issue. (Something is wrong with the attack script and it mainly happens in fort defense or attack.)
Units CANNOT use walls.
This was done in medieval, but here CA failed to do what they already had in the past.
1 guy is out of position running back and forth in the same place, so the entire unit just stands about without firing a single shot. And units CANNOT find a route off-on a wall. 1 bloke is stuck on the wall? Well the entire unit runs back to him, even if they almost reached their target already. Gates are used in a 1 man line for some reason they are as if they were a tight rope.

Your cannons play a very important role. BUT you MUST switch off auto aim. The canon crews execute themselves firing sideways, through the cannon next to them within the same crew, just to be scared of their own mental backwardness and flee in terror. They will also happily execute anyone on their side without further consideration.

If you want to put down money for such a game buy medieval or ""buy it off a friend"" and fund modders who may fix this cluster mess. On that point, it is also harder to mod this game than Medieval, so you will find fewer overhauls and fixes.

Whioever scored this game higher... I do not know what you see in it, compared ot working games. If I put Medieval2 at 8/10 this cannot be above 5.

It was a breathtaking sight that, once growing pains had passed, delivered a monumental Total War experience that remains the title for which I most want a sequel. Fall of the Samurai showed just how far CA has come with this style of warfare and I cannot wait. 

All that being said, the game isn't without its flaws.

This game is, beyond a doubt, one of the most uninspiring games of the Total War series that I have had the pleasure of playing.  It has so many bugs, you'd think of calling your local pest control.  The portraits for the characters in the game are..lackluster.  They didn't even bother to give the people in the portraits a background, at least in my experience with the game.  The Battle AI is absolutely random, having some brilliant moments of high-stakes deployment, but other times losing a battle they should clearly win.  I myself survived a nasty battle, playing as Sweden.  I had four regiments of line infantry, and was attacked by nearly a stack of Austrian militia and line infantry, yet I still won because the Austrian soldiers actually refused to press forward and engage me.

That last bit is the heart of the issue; this game, as incredible as the potential was for a world-wide, 18th century-based game, it is seriously undercut by the odd decisions that were undertaken. For example, I don't know who's idea it was to make every single siege battle on a city with walls look identical, but that was lazy work.  Even as far back as Rome: Total War, cities had varying shapes and sizes to their walls.  Yet things are identical, here, in the 18th century?  A time marked by decidedly huge differences in everything from one cities' religious tolerance, to troops per unit, to the ideals of the local monarch?  Creative Assembly, please.  We would rather you take longer and give us a better experience, than to hurry up and weaken the magic of your earlier works.

But, you may be reading this, and seeing that I still recommend this game.  Why is that?

Because this game does many things very well indeed.  When at 'ultra' settings, this game is very, very beautiful.  Crisp uniforms, detailed smoke clouds from mass musket volley fire, the reflective water on the campaign map.  I find it all very much a step into a new era of Total War.  And the audio is impressive, as well.  The sound of hundreds of men running and shouting in combat, the sound of cannon barrages firing and then the thumping clash of the shells landing upon the enemy, the officers' barking orders, to which a drum plays the command to the men.  As a fan of history, I can't help but find myself fully immersed in the sounds of the battle, despite the lackluster AI ability.

There is, however, a much larger reason to play this game.  A reason that fits nearly every single game since 2000.  What am I talking about? 

Modifications.

The community for this game have made hundreds, if not THOUSANDS, of modifications for this game, ranging from changing the accuracy of the men in each regiment, to a complete and total overhaul of the game...including ridding the game of most of the issues that it was saddled with upon its release.

So yes, this game is far from perfect.  It does have many issues.  But, in the end, I will gladly recommend this game to any fan of historical affectations, or even simply those of a curious mindset.  Because despite this game not being perfect, it brings enough to the table to keep those that are willing to work through the issues entertained.

I remember this when it was released years ago, that this game was VERY buggy at the time, 7 years later and some game-breaking bugs still EXIST.

One of this, is the notorius save game corrupt bug that i just experienced. When you get far in the game, 50 turns+, there is a danger that the your save games WILL GET CORRUPTED. This happens without warning, if you seat down for long sessions, and just save save save and save, and overwrite previous saves, and don't load back, there is a great danger that you will lose a lot of progress.

 You will only notice then in your next session, that you can't load anymore anymore any of your save games. They will just cause the game to crash to the desktop.

What happens when the game starts corrupting the save games, all saves you do after that point will also get corrupted, so there is a chance you wont know it, and you will need to go a long way back.

I read the in forums of several people experiencing this, and its pretty common, and some can't finish the game, because they get stuck in a neverending corrupt-reload-go back loop.

So please let this be a warning, so if you are going to play, backup regularly, or dont' overwrite your save games.

31,21429155,english,"A note: I've only played singleplayer, and usually just the grand campaign.

I enjoy this game greatly, but it is not without its flaws.  Unless you're an avid fan of 18th century history or feel you must own every Total War game, I would recommend holding off on purchasing this title until it's on sale.

Pros: You get to pick a nation in 1700 and do whatever you want.  Yes, there are campaign objectives set for either 1750 or 1800 depending on your settings, but there's no real penalty to not completing these apart from a ""you lose"" screen at the deadline.  Win or lose, the game allows you to play beyond the deadline if you wish to, although line infantry and wooden sailing ships in the mid 1900s would seem a bit odd.  You can try to follow your nation's historical path (like being the Russian empire and Pushing the Swedes out of Ingria), or depart from history completely (like conquering the entire Indian subcontinent as Prussia).

Cons: The AI.  Its performance can be both a source of amusement and frustration.  Pathfinding, for example, can be quite irritating, as you watch your grenadiers struggle with their greatest foe: the doorway.  Likewise the game covers up some of the enemy AI shortcomings by giving your opponents advantages.  Their general will run away the minute you select any unit to attack him (especially noticable when you attack with artillery, as his Spidey Sense goes off before the first cannonball is even fired).  You must be ever watchful for friendly fire, while opponents can launch mortars into their own ranks without so much as a scratch.  Seemingly poor nations weild armies that should bankrupt them, but somehow they stay afloat, and absurd trade offers are the norm (200 gold for my most valuable region?  No.  No, thank you).  Apart from the occasional corrupted save (maybe one in every 20 campaigns), I haven't encountered any game-breaking bugs.

Some other points:
The game offers different government types and revolutions.  Do you want to rule your empire with an iron fist as a monarch, suppressing any unrest with your military, or would you rather embrace Enlightenment ideals and side with the populace in creating a free republic?  Each system has its own advantages and drawbacks, both internally and on the diplomatic stage.
Combat, naturally, is one of the main focuses of the game, with real-time fighting taking place whenever two opposing armies or navies meet.  You can choose to hold a line and bombard your foes with artillery, fix bayonets and scale enemy city walls, or move cavalry along a flank and charge with cold steel (and many other tactics and combinations).  Researching technology unlocks more powerful units and abilities, allowing you to dominate the battlefield.
Each nation speaks its native language instead of accented English, which is always a nice touch.  All factions also have their own unique units, though some have more than others (looking at you, Britain).  DLCs help this a little, but mods are the way to go if you really want a wide variety of regiments at your service.

Anyhow, those are my thoughts on the title.  I enjoy the game a lot, but it is certainly not perfect.",1456336609,1456336609,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561197994663445,129,1,80735,0,42270.0,1594049227

totally broken, you play 10 minutes of it and it crashes.

its unplayable because of the first fact, it crashes before you can enjoy it.
its a shame really because if it managed to stay on without crashing out and booting you from game all the time it very well could have been a decent game.

but based on the fact it doesnt work i really cant reccomend this, especially due to the fact that every other total war game works perfectly for me with no crashes, this empire one is the only one out of entire series that dont work.

It is a shame that so many people paid money for this strategic cake, but are not able to enjoy it. (I really tried to like it and to play it, but instead most of the play time comes from the try to fix the problems that came with the last patches)

On some PCs (my very new one included) the text is so blurry in all possible graphic configurations, it gives you a headache and makes the game unplayable. There is no problem solving until today, but there are a lot of threads with very friendly people where this problem is discussed (just look in the forum of steam for text issues or search your browser for blurry text empire).

So if you want to join the club, just pay the price here in the shop and you are maybe the next one that doesn't get a playable game, but contact with very friendly people. From this point of view it is really not expensive.^^

(yes, so original of me)


10/10 realism


Now for a serious review, this game is one of my top favorite Total War games, having Rome 1 and Medievel 2 along it's side
First, let me say the bad, then good

-Gameplay can get repetitive, but I personally don't mind it, I practice on ""play battle"" with different units to see if my strategies work on different occasions, but really, it's the same thing, unless you are really strategic, and want to try lots of different methods, like myself, then this should be a good thing

-Few nations. I had to download mods that let me be most, if not, all, of the nations existing in the game. Hopefully, if they make an Empire II, I would like to see more nations, and have the time period last a VERY long time, and actually have the technology tree to ""evolve"" the types of clothes/armor/weapons in the units. (if SEGA lets CA have ALL of the time they need to make that happen, please SEGA, let them release a polished game from day one.)

-Generic units. Now I know, they all had similar units realistically, but really they had different clothing, so there should be more diverse clothing, the only diversity in the clothing, is the color


Now for the good/positives

+The game has a very interesting campaign, at least in my view

+Realistic causes and effects of the switch/types of government

+Realistic mechanics

+HUGE campaign map

+Can be ANY given nation to take over the whole campaign world

+Good historic battles

and many more things, because this game to me feels very fun, and I don't feel bored of it, because I can be my ancestors (Spain) and try to reenact things they did in real history, and do the same with the US, if not, greater than what was really done

The odd thing which I think I have been fortunate to have experienced is that over the time I have owned this game I can count the crashes on one hand.  Others have not been nearly so fortunate.

You'll also want to turn up the difficulty or you will wonder how the whole world wasn't conquered by this or that faction.  In the battlefield the AI is fairly poor despite if you turn up the battle difficulty and is made up for by padding the AI stats.  Still there will be times when the enemy will sit there and be happy to let you blow them appart with long range artillery fire.  I generally autoresolve as I play for the big picture.

The naval battles are nice to watch but fairly limited in tactics.  Basically you are trying to set up favorable fields of fire but generally I was able to manage favorable engagements on the campaign map eliminating the need for advanced tactics.  Essentially two lines staggered will completly crush their fleet every time.  Unless of course you failed on the campaign layer.

Haven't tried MP yet because I'm an anti-social gamer.   So can't say about that one.

I can see why many think this is the weakest entry in the TW series but not for me I enjoy the original Shogun and Medieval the least probably due to their age respectively.

85,20096092,english,"Empire: Total War is an edition in the Total War series consisting of the titles Rome: Total War, Medieval: Total War 1/2, and many more.  Empire: Total War, if I am not mistaken, is the first Total War game in the series to introduce gunplay in battles along with user controlled naval warfare. I suggest playing the previous installments before jumping into this game.



Now let's talk about this game.

You start off like most Total War games by selecting who you want your faction to be. Depending on who you choose will place you on a certain part of the map. An addition to this game from the previous installments was that it used more than just Europe and a few surrounds areas. Instead it incorportated parts of Africa and North America. You could travel to the different sections of the world on your power for conquest. 

The gameplay consists of the player controlling cities, armies, and special units. Same as other Total War games:

-Cities: Generate Revenue, Can Create Units, Expand Your Empire, ect..

-Armies: Can Conqour Cities, Defend Against Enemies, Build Forts, ect..

-Special Units: Spy For Subertufuge, Assassin For High Targets, Generals, ect..


The main goal is the take over a certain amount of Cities before you hit a designated time period. You can fight the battles over an instant computer generated decision or you can manually control your troops on the battlefield.  Diplomacy can be made with other factions for things like trade, alliances, and much more.

I enjoyed this game for the most part. While on the other hand I would recommend buying the other Total War games. Namely Rome: Total War the original and Medieval II: Total War.

The entirety of the game is based around The Grand Campaign  which is both addictive and fun, but at the same time, incredibly frustrating and highly difficult, especially if you're playing on any difficulty above normal. 

You must choose your nation and follow the victory conditions and historically accurate objectives designated to that particular faction. At the beginning of the game your nation will either be large and powerful, small and feeble or somewhere inbetween. Each of these has their own advantages which out-shines the other. No matter what faction you choose, it's still conquer or be conquered, so how you establish your relations with other nations, whether it be by invasion or diplomatic talks is entirely up to you. 

The Real-Time battles in ETW can go on for hours depending on how and where you fight. Personally, I try to avoid fighting battles as they have many elements that are broken and sometimes cause me to restart my game. Many of these bugs were taken out in the succeeding Napoleon: Total War. Nevertheless, the campaign itself is still very fun. As a bonus, the game also features another campaign based around the American Revolutionary Wars, an important aspect in colonial history.

People blame Empire for all bad things, but when it comes down to it, Empire TW was the first game with a new battle engine that really had the capability to capture all the glory and death in Europe during the 18th CenturyAD. One of the best parts about it, is the Road to Independence Campaign, or the ""America"" campaign where you begin as the British in the ""New World"", and move to rising up and furthering the greatness of the American Republic. Empire TW is truly a great game for those who enjoy American history, and the 18th Century.",1450228471,1450228471,True,3,1,0.531214535236358643,0,True,False,False,76561198175620425,53,12,7837,0,5856,1593447900
28,19710153,english,"In regards to general gameplay this game quite a shift in a series that tends to focus more on the melee combat of the European and Japanese middle ages. Takes a little getting used to as battles are fought rather differently on land and actual naval battles being introduced into the series for the first time. But once you get used to the changes this game is a blast to play.  Watching battles unfold in this game is rather enjoy able, as you see your battle lines form up, open fire, and march through volley after volley of cannon and musket fire over piles of dead soldiers.  It's also very amusing how you can get so engrossed in watching your infantry that you forget that there is still calvalry in the game until they come crashing into your flank and endanger your entire battle plan. In terms of looks and playbility I can go on all day about why this game is bloody awesome.

That said it does have some downsides. Occasionally the enemy generals will suicide charge at the start of the battle resulting in an easy win as their army's moral plummets in response. Then the enemy units will sometimes start moving non-stop randomly, running back and forth until the entire army is exhausted and has been demolished by cannon fire.(An everlasting bug in all Total War games sadly) Unlike other games of the series your generals are no longer unique. You can create them at will from another unit, and keep both, making them just another unit instead of something you worked to earn, develop and preserve; losing one of them doesn't threaten to unhinge your plans in the slightest outside of the battle they die in.  You also have no real control over your government personel except for the option to sack them, really your government seems to effect the game even less than losing your generals now. Lastly, there is paid DLC that should have been in the game from the start. Other than the warpath campaign there is no excuse for this obvious cash grab.

Overall though, this is a very good game and is very fun to play. I have truly enjoyed this game and would recommend this to anyone without a second thought. And like all Total War games that it's available for I highly recommend Darthmod after you've played this game and seen what it has to offer by itself.

This is a really good Total War game. It is more up to date than Medieval II (good game) and playes much better than Napoleon or Shogun II. Shogun II runs badly and has balance issues, whereas Napoleon has few enemies (although those few enemies have large territories.)

You get to perform research in Empire. I do wish the research tree was larger for Battle and Economic areas. It is very large on Philosophy. 

The units are nice. All three arms of the military, infantry, cavalry and artillery, are equal in this time period and thus all three types of units have a role on the battlefield. Having a good mix of these works really well.

Generals can be appointed easily and troops can move and attack without generals.

AI can often times be incredibly stupid. (Sitting imobile outside of your fort for the entire 60 minutes as you wait for time to run out.)

58,17559014,english,"Update: Game is prone to crashing regularly in a long campaign game. Makes it unplayable even after the starting few turns of play. Can be stabilized after a few graphics tweaks but both crashes and corrupts saves often enough to discourage play. ***NOT RECOMMENDED UNTIL RESOLVED ***

Empire Total War (E:TW) is a RTS set in the 1700's. It has a single player campaign mode on a strategic map which add to the game greatly (and therefore is a shame that is not multiplayer). A worthy successor to the Total War series and an excellent historical battle simulator. 

Graphics are much improved over Mediaeval and Rome TW but the movement controls are worse as the system struggles to path and place units according to their formation and position units around cover: you can often find a unit moving accross the map to nowhere. Indeed AI is generally extremely problematic: units have more of a tendency to not follow movement orders once engaged; units can be blithely matching through enemy ranks as a pitched battle occurs around them; troops will march in front of their own cannons and get killed; horse carriages will go over obstacles (like cannon emplacements and get killed).

Also the campaign game forces storyline battles on you. I had just finished capturing Canada from the French and was ready to re-enter real life when I was thrown into Bunker Hill without warning or explanation and had to fight another battle: a battle I subsequently lost because I had to stop the game and was not allowed to save the game. I had to beat the French in Canada four times before I got the game to a save point where I had won Bunker Hill. This is done for the sake of storyline momentum but but there would have been no harm putting in a save point.

This lack of attention to player experience in interface and storyline is seen also in the exposition in the in-game help. Nowhere does it say that unit will fire into their own troops or how this operates (sometimes they do, sometimes they hit their own troops, sometimes only the enemy), nor how to cancel a building destruction/construction order, how cover works and how units wrap around them, how to cancel a broadside, why are only the first line of troops firing etc. Forums help here but a few more tool tips wouldn't go astray as the experience of using gunpowder weapons is different to the previous more melee centric TW series; archers can arc over troops but muskets travel a flatter trajectory after all.

On broadsides, ship battles are very well done. I haven't player other ship simulators since Port Royal, but it was very satisfying demasting a ship. Again, not a lot of exposition, like that the compass actually refers to wind direction.

Individual unit animations are very good and troops will even jump over obstacles.

Loading times are very slow and the system does not quite know how to handle two monitors.

In all, a very good game that is puntuated by poor AI, poor exposition, forced stroyline battles you cannot save, and no restart button as in other TW games.",1439684129,1443604153,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198013359559,459,49,5545,0,4261,1442827729

The fact that the unit collision and melee is a joke, that although pretty much all civilizations have the same rooster with some minor changes due to the westernization of world armies that happened in the XVIII century yet you are denied the ability to play as minor nations unless you mod the game, the fact that the game is so streamlined and kinda easy compared to its predecessores, the fact that diplomacy is so broken that god forbid you ask for a trade agreement, it's like insulting the king's mother, dog and wife at the same time, not to mention the random declaration of war by a long time ally and friend and the fact that agents spawn randomly, often where you don't need them and generals now have no political influence make it a frustrating experience sometimes.

Yet I still do recommend this game. Why? Simply because even though the game has its issues, it was patched, its better now compared to release, not as buggy, and most of all it's still a good game, one of the best games, if not the best, that have that time period as its background.

The A.I is ridiculously poor, during sieges the infantry refuse to shoot, or cannons knock down their own walls, and if the computer is the attacking faction the game seems to know that the A.I won't be able to attack on its own, so it cheats. I've started sieges with sections of my walls already knocked down, and sometimes the enemy need only come into close proximity of my gates for the computer to unlock them for the A.I. More often than not the infantry units simply walk around the map, allowing themselves to be killed or routed. I've installed one or two mods to help with the A.I, which has improved it slightly, but sieges still remain horrible affairs, with soldiers trying to shoot through walls, or even killing men on their own team.

1,17858293,english,"Lets begin by saying that Napoleon: Total War is better if you are not willing to mod this game. N:TW is basically what Empire was supposed to be. Cost an extra game's worth :( 

See, E:TW was 'broken' into service. Originally so badly launched that you couldn't even play it until a week after release, it was patched over, and, over, this bug, that bug, and after a time, CA just said ""Damn, GG. Next game :("" 

So what's that make it now? The best Total War ever, ironically. Top three at least. Read on and see how this catastrophe turned into a miracle.

History: After a long time, post - N:TW release, the head dev of CA came out and said something along the lines of (paraphrasing) ""E:TW was just beyond the scope of what we were capable of"" and  just gave all the deepest dev tools over to the mod community. Damn, E:TW looked so good in previews! I honestly was rooting for them all the way - this was gonna be a showstopper. But, we got more than we bargained for. 

See, guns were a massive step from medieval2 combat. Things were going to be different and people were stoked! But the AI wasn't quite there to match the era yet. For example,
 
-the AI for properly lining a unit and properly zerging with a axes are two separate war principles
-the economy of traditional units versus guns. Sorry horses - start of point and shoot warfare
-AI could not manage artillery based combat AT ALL. Oh yes, in RL they shelled people down until they did something, it's a legitimate tactic. Pretty sure firing into hills is not.
-some new features like research. If 2 schools beat the AI, it wasn't ready for players to go like, 8

+Naval combat. First time ever! Ironically, this was the most polished AI and in major engagements it was okay. But when you realized it just chases it was so abusable. A 6th rate could sink the Spanish Armada solo by simply running alot and maintaining distance.

But... the scale of the world, man! Gone were the days of Europe, you now manage an Empire. Multi-map, continental combat. The Earth itself. Yet, that was too grand a step for CA. Some serious design flaws led to, once again, easily abusable tactics that needed patches. Ex. The AI ""originally"" couldn't figure out how to land armies. If you were Britain you won the game, besides the OP start position you had in the world. No attempts to make a multimap game have occurred since Empire: Total War, from this time of writing. All evidence of an ""exterior world"" lies on beacons or map icons representing the rest of wherever, and you send a unit to sit on it like some couch potato. In Empire, you sent a freaking army, on your navy, D-day style. Oh hell yes!

Luckily, like an Elder Scrolls mod community, E:TW's fans took the work into their hands and have many ways to polish this game into a true gem. Like rebuilding a classic car, not every '69 Fastback you can get comes in mint condition, and with the Karate Kid focus of many Empire fans, This Game is a Proper Addition to the Total War series. 

Thumbs Up. So before you go autobuy N:TW, consider E:TW plus a megamod. Something like DarthMod Ultimate Commander to this. Get the same-ish game for less, but with a polished AI, bug fixes galore, and so much more potential for mischief.

Will the Inuit overwhelm the fledgling United States and invade France, causing a power struggle in Europe? Have you ever seen how big a Pirate armada can become if left unchecked?

===========================

The controls are cumbersome and the units randomly disobey orders, making control on the battlefield frustrating: 
- the units keep switching to slow speed whenever you reroute them while marching
- artillery frequently keeps firing even after you order it to pack and retreat (killing your own advancing troops) only if you deselect 'fire at will' it's guaranteed to stop
- you can't create a path with waypoints.

Battles, and especially sieges, are ludicrous and pathetic:
- Forts are indestructible - the only way to capture them is by climbing the walls (really, in the age of artillery?)
- The battle map is too small, you are not allowed to freely deploy your army and the game assigns you the most inconvenient spot 
- reinforcing enemy armies appear out of nowhere right near you, without any notice
- artillery that rarely hits anything, although it's 'accuracy' is 45%. I tested once firing against a still infantry formation and registered a hit after 30 rounds.
- brain dead AI that keeps standing still in the middle of artillery fire
- large rebel armies with cavalry and artillery units spawned against game mechanics (how could recruitment happen so fast especially when you have 20 unit army in the province - and where would the money come from)

The game map is terribly unbalanced, the provinces are way too large and weirdly separated.

The whole concept of 'gentlemen' and rakes is completely beyond me, especially the difficulty in assasinating them. You should at least be able to expel or arrest them as an 'absolute monarch' of a mighty 'empire'. It would have been much better if you could recuit them like you do with armies and send them as ambassadors.

Units appearing on the map are too large and those stupid flags are too big and obtrusive. 
Extremely dense and suicidal AI players that keep declaring war against much bigger opponents:
if you declared war on me and I took three of your provinces including the capital, how would I give you one of my provinces when you call for peace?

37,17589476,english,"Thoroughly unimpressive. To be honest, I wanted to like this game. It looks like a Total War game but alas, it does not feel or play like one. I guess I was just looking for something more... entertaining?

First off, I'm a fan of the time period. That was one of the biggest draws for me. But for every step forward, I feel like Empire Total War takes two steps back. The first sign of disappointment came after two and a half hours of game play. Up until that point, I was still getting acclimated to the controls, visuals, etc etc. The time came for me to boldly ride forth and vanquish my foes in an enemy fort. What transpired could only be described as a giant boring mosh pit. Clones in different color clothing flailed at each other for a while; desperate to get those kill moves in before they all die of old age. On the fastest speed, it probably took five minutes of real time to clear up the traffic jam at hole in my enemies wall. Still, I was optimistic.

A few hours of gameplay later, and another incident occurred. This time I was defending my fort against my enemies. I was clearly unprepared and had a disadvantage in both troop number and troop quality. At all other points of the game, I was playing to the numbers and crushing every battle; so obviously my expectation was that I was on the receiving end of the beating this time. Yet the AI curiously decided to section its assaulting force into bits and parade around my fort; instead of assaulting it head on, like someone trying to win would. Needless to say, that didn't end well for them. After that, I couldn't pretend  that I liked this game anymore.

But at the end of the day, I can't say I hate this game. Sure, my list of complaints are many; but it all boils down to what I had feared... This game isn't a total war game. It's someones crude imitation of what a total war game set in this period would look like. That's not to say it isn't terrible. It's just dull. For my money, the original rome total war, or shogun 2 are superior in both spirit and gameplay.

This game combines turn-based strategy (world map) and real-time strategy (during battles) which it does beautifully. Battles are fun, with the rare AI pathing error and in my opinion unit sizes are a bit on the small side. On ultra or high graphics look good but not amazing (black powder discharge looks more like fog than smoke) and some uniforums could use some reworking. Unlike other games the turn-basied system in this game is very smooth and your decision on the world map are very important and a few errors here could result in you losing a terriotry or two. 

OVERALL OPINION:

-This game will keep you playing for a long time.
-It rarely seems to get boring.
-On higher diffculty this game offers a great challenge.
-If you can look past the occasional AI pathing error then you will enjoy this game.

You basically rely on mods, forums and research to play this game in a semi-stable condition (with emphasis on ""semi""). This game is seriously broken.

The graphics are good, but animations and level design are sub-par at least. Cavarly fights are disgustingly bad animated, as an example.

AI is poor to say the least. But being honest, AI is completly undeveloped. 

It makes me sad for two things: first, I don't like throwing away my money. Second, the developers probably saw potential in this idea, but then they took a gigantic dump into it, put a few naval battles and released it.
To this day, the game looks like a BETA.

If you value your money, your time and your sanity, don't buy it. If you want to try it on a discount, GET MODS (darthmod kinda fixes the game, kinda). If you still wanna buy it for some reason at full price, well... enjoy throwing your money. Seriously this game is a huge dissapointment. Do not buy.

6,17217163,english,"Going through the Total War games in order of release, I came upon a strange offspring of the series called Empire. Now mind you, in this review I will be describing both the game as it was released and patched over time, and I will cover a mod for this game that I am personally playing right now called DarthMod.

So, where to start wih this one? You are probably aware by now that the developers of the Total War series, Creative Assembly, have had somewhat of a disaster with their release of Rome 2 and have been patching it constantly ever since. From what I've read(not having played that game) most of the game breaking bugs and failures have been eliminated, but the game itself is still hardly a challenge because of the bad AI programming.

That is pretty much the case with this game, even after a substantial amount of time passed between release and me writing this. The game is still fun as hell, and there will on occasion be a challenging battle or siege where the AI might be competent.  Also, the game tends to lag a lot in drawn out battles, even with a powerful processor. As I understand, this was the first game based on the Warscape engine and it seems that the devs at the time did not master it.These are some of the biggest gripes I have with this game, and there is a host of smaller ones. In any case, the game is flawed.

But underneath all the problems and bugs and flaws there is an incredibly engrossing and rich game which takes you to imperial era of the 18th century, giving you access to 3 strategic theaters to wage war, use subterfuge, develop your resources and loads of other activities. You will build powerful armies of infantry, cavalry and artillery with which to conquer, mighty fleets of warships to control the seas and protect your trade routes or raid your enemies. The naval battles are also a hell of a lot of fun once you get used to the wind mechanics and how to fire your cannons. I strongly recommend reading a guide on naval battles if you are unfamiliar with how sailing ships work. 

All of this adds up to a very good, if inconsistent, experience. But you know what's better? Having a grand experience all the way through. If you are willing, check out DarthMod and possibly some of the submods for it. It makes the game what it was supposed to be from the start, improving the AI substantially and actually making almost every battle a real challenge. It doesn't fix some of the core game problems with the engine and due to improved graphics it can lag a bit on slower computers, but if you can run it, get it ASAP. Be warned though, it is tough. Campaign AI is much more aggressive and willing to maneuver to get what it wants, and the battle AI for naval battles will seem like Satan at first because of the maneuvers it pulls.

tl/dr: Great game, even better with mods.

Bavaria moved in and took out Hannover and the United Provinces.. I go to look at what is going on in India and Maratha has expanded about 3-4 more cities into the Mughal Empire. about 10 turns later i look and the Mughal pushed them back to the original two they start with. and about 20 turns after that, the Mughal Empire has completely killed the Maratha Confederacy, and took over all of the middle east and is now taking on the Ottoman Empire and kicking ass. Oh and by now i took over Sweden, Denmark, Polish-Lithuania, Courland, and Russia.

A short, vicious war in Ireland put paid to any chance of a Catholic Stuart restoration. Nonetheless, the exiled James Stuart has sympathisers, the Jacobites, throughout Britain. Despite - or perhaps because of - this turbulent history, Britain is an engine driving the scientific and cultural advancement of northern Europe; turmoil foils creativity.

My job was fueled by my ambition and patriotism. I was to turn my country, previously fighting internally, to face outwards across the sea. Take possession of colonies in the America's and India. Destroy the French. Create the East India Company. Destroy the French. Take the archiapelago of Meditterannean islands and turn them into naval bases. Destroy the French. Use these naval bases to invade mainland Europe. Destroy the French. Claim global domination. Burn down Paris.

Venice belongs to the Spanish Empire at long last. The rivalry between the Venetians and the Spanish over a contested Italy had spawned conflicts for decades now, and everybody is happy to see that this bloodshed is now but history. There is a problem to be dealt with though, because these lands are wanted by the bloodthirsty Austrian Empire, to the northeast. I have sent diplomats to give their sovereign the finest of our horses as a state gift, presenting myself to them as a friend. The Austrian Emperor welcomed the gift, though it was useless, for one week later Austrian soldiers sacked our minor undefended towns all over Rhineland, Lombardy, and Venetia itself. The Austrians had not only declared war: they had commited crimes they could not be forgiven of.

November 25th, 1744, Zagreb

I ordered a massive ammount of my valiant soldiers, under the command of general Juan Ortíz, to march towards Zagreb, in the region of Croatia, to free the city of Austrian rule. We saw a devastated land along the way, and the city itself had little shine, for we saw that the Austrians cared little for the Croatian people, and cared too much for the Croatian goods. The garrison at Zagreb was mediocre at best, and was quickly defeated by my ranks, as my horsemen drew their swords and shouted in victory, while the Spanish flag rose from the City Hall and all the people cheered, for they were now free of their oppressors.

December 14th, 1744, Zagreb

The rebuilding of Zagreb and all of Croatia had but begun, but the Austrian Emperor was bursting so much with anger, that he could not wait a single second, and sent a huge force directly from Viena to reclaim Zagreb. It was a force composed by thousands of musketmen, mortars, cannons and hungarian hussars, all marching straight towards the city. I ordered Ortíz to defend the city with his very own life, if necessary, because he had the finest soldiers of Spain under his command and the most vulnerable citizens under his protection. As dusk approached, a heavy rain started falling over the city and the fields around it. Ortíz ordered the citizens to take up arms and get into the buildings to have a safe firing spot, while the Spanish line infantry would dig up trenches over the city streets, forming dead ends from where they could shoot the invaders that entered the city from the north. Some men stood hiding among the trees to the west of the city to ambush any Austrians trying to come around, and last but not least, men dug up trenches on the hills to the east, hoping to shoot any climbing Austrians. To the south, artillery was positioned to give cover fire to any of these positions, with Ortíz alongside hid general's bodyguard right beside the cannon. As the men were eagerly waiting, black and yellow flags appeared over the horizon and started to approach quickly.

The battle for Zagreb had begun.

The Austrians cowardly fire incendiary bombs from their howitzers to the civil buildings of the city. Ortíz orders the citizens to move to the streets so they will not collapse with the buildings. Austrians climbing the hill take volley after volley of gunshots and start to flee. In the forest, austrians are killed by bayonets from my concealed soldiers but inside the city itself, my men are sorrounded amidst the fire and the invading forces. Taking too much casualties, the armed citizens leave their guns and run with despair, fearing for their lives. Almost half the city is filled with black and yellows, and I Ortíz tries to use the men in the woods to sorround them from behind. The tactic works, and the Austrians in the city retreat to fields on the north. As my lines reorganize themselves to fire, more austrians come out of the northern woods and organize themselves as well. Being on the open field, my men are very succeptible to the howitzers, and start losing numbers very quickly to the balls of fire. Ortíz Himself runs towards the blazing streets and falling rain, circles through the infantry lines and dashes towards the howitzers, killing the artillerists and destroying the cannons. Just as he was about to return, a line of Austrian musketmen point their guns towards his bodyguard and shoots.

Ortíz falls off his horse.
His chest is filled with blood.
He is dead.

The tears of the men are confused with the rainfall for their lost general, and they fight even harder for the Austrians had killed their precious leader. They manage to push away their attackers to the north. On the hill to the east, the men come out of their trenches to fight the Austrians at the base of the hill. The two forces meet and start fighting alongside each other. There are no more bullets, the fight is only bayonets, punches, and kicks, and the Austrians quickly see that they are sorrounded, and start to run away. The few Spanish soldiers remaining run after them, but quickly fall to the ground in exhaustion. They look back at the city, their musket in hand, the water falling through their clothes and penetrating through their wounds like it was salt. The city was blazing among all that water, dead bodies and much, much blood filled the streets, a heavy smell of gunpowder, molten steel, and burned flesh stood over the air, but the soldiers permitted themselves a timid smile.

The buildings in Zagreb were destroyed
Her fields, laid trampled
Many of her sons, dead in the middle of the streets
But her spirit was intact
Her people, hopeful
Her liberty, fortified
Her safety, guaranteed.

Maps of whole of Europe (including Island), North, Central and good chunk of Souther America, northern Africa and India. Coupled with many factions to play with (but not all factions which could be amended by using mods that unlock all factions).

As vanila goes the game has quality as most TW games have. At the same time it also has that arcadey touch where, like in many TW games, soldiers die too quickly and combat is too short for my taste and love for reality.

This game is great platform for modds, and the only reason I bought it is because of mods and ability to play multiplayer.

Where this game shine is with mods. Use Darthmod or Empire Realism, to name two. With many other mods like American Civil war and similar you will find combination of my first sentence in this review (great scope of campaign) with gameplay that surpasess arcadey vanilla touch and adds to immersion of the game.

That is all you need - to built in sandbox huge empire and at the same time have improved game through mods, because despite patches the original game was not optimised, it staggered and came as an unfinished product, still great enough to make you forgive its flaws.

47,16925925,english,"I give a very conditional recommend for this game. It feels that every game in the Total War series would be great games even if they only live up to half of what they aspire to be. In Empire: Total War's case, half is about right. The game is incredibly ambitious, and while it does get some things right it also leaves many fundamentals broken (though arguably these are present in every Total War game). When things are good though, the game is a thing of beauty, and there are no games quite like it. 

The good: 

- The scope of the game is immense - covering all five continents in one of the most interesting and volatile period of human history 
- The battle simulation actually feels like a simulation - cannonballs bounce as they hit the ground, spilling dirt and crushing infantry. Soldiers stationed on top of fortifications fall to their deaths when the walls they stand on lose integrity and collapse. Weapons can jam, and you can hear the distinct clicks of misfired guns 
- Sound design and animations are fantastic. The game allows you to lower the camera down to shoulder level with the solders, and you can hear the whistle of cannonballs flying overhead, the marching steps of the infantry, and see the meticulously animated reloading sequence
- The game is very, very pretty. The characters, ships and buildings are extremely detailed, and you can put the game into slow motion to see beautifully rendered explosions of the ship's powder mags, the splinters coming off ships as cannonballs strike them, and line of infantry taking turns to shoot at each other in battle 

The bad: 

- The AI, in both campaign map and battle, is extremely dumb. On the campaign map the AI likes to move units around singly, instead of combining them so that they stand a better chance of survival in case of an ambush. The AI also marches armies directly into interception range of armies more than twice its size for them to get crushed, and attacked a besieged city twice with two half stacks instead of combining both to overwhelm the player 
- In battle, the AI flounders badly, sending units up against the the player's line singly instead of moving the entire line, allowing the player to concentrate firepower and wipe them out individually in otherwise well matched battles. In addition, the AI appears incapable of using buildings and fortifications at all - when defending a settlement, instead of installing units in buildings, the AI will simply march them towards the player to have them slaughtered 
- Other curious incidents include the AI leaving his units as sitting ducks for 45 minutes while I wipe out half his force with a squad of howitzer due to my artillery advantage, charging at infantry using light cavalry, who got wiped when said infantry formed up into box formation, and placing infantry within melee distance of artillery, shooting at my infantry unit while ignoring the canister shots decimating his unit 
- The pathfinding is horrible. This is especially apparent with units on fortification. Tasked with fighting an enemy on fortification, a unit would split itself in two, with half climbing the wall while the other half attempting to walk through the gates, even though the gates are not captured. Ordering a unit on fortification to attack the enemy with the fortification cannon is a hit and miss affair, since there are no 'man cannon' order, you have to rely on the game guessing your intention, otherwise the infantry would march out of the gates to confront the enemy on the ground 
- Ordering a unit to attack an enemy is a hit and miss affair. Sometimes, when ordered to fire on an enemy that is already within range, a unit will wheel around leisurely and ready itself to fire, instead of SHOOTING THOSE BASTARDS ALREADY. Similarly, ordering a unit of 120 men to engage a unit of 60 enemies in melee will sometimes result in 60 of the 120 men breaking formation to engage the enemy one-on-one while their compatriot stand in formation like idiots instead of ganging up on the enemy 
- Artillery can be ordered to attack ground outside their range - they will try, but their shots will fall short and miss - but not to attack units outside their range. If you do, the attack fails silently, and they would revert to firing at will at units within range. Artillery also do not prioritize units properly, sometimes firing at fleeing enemies over nearby enemies that are still shooting and thus present a bigger threat 
- Artillery units cannot target to avoid friendly fire. I'm not just talking about friendly fire when your infantry is standing in front of them, but they'll hit themselves (!) when they fire at an angle. 
- Diplomacy is a joke. While the AI makes an effort at realpolitiks and recognize when the situation is hopeless, they usually does so far too late. In addition, the AI often makes completely ridiculous, such as Austria offering India a piece of Europe in exchange for a trade treaty. 
- The game is buggy. Enemy units will walk through gates which have been captured by the player, even though those games are suppose to be locked visually. A single horse would get stuck around a rock when entering the battlefield as reinforcement, making the entire unit untargetable, and thus forcing me to bring artillery to shoot at them point blank to end a battle where every other unit has already fled

76,16801215,english,"The release of Empire was an utter travesty on the Total War series, and while many of the original game-breaking problems were fixed, there remain remenants of a rushed production and bad decision making, worst of which is a weak AI that does not even begin to border on logical. You will be lambasted by offers to trade your major provinces for tiny island colonies almost every turn. In battle the AI will ignore your regiments of infantry and rush through them in an attempt to attack your artillery. You will have to take almost every province of a nation before they'll decide to give you peace, so you can deal with the other four nations that declared war on your last turn. 

There are many bugs still in this game that at times greatly removes any sense of pleasure in playing it. Cavalry clipping into buildings and being stuck, some armies completely ignoring your intercepting armies and rushing around them to do nothing more than raid your farm, and artillery aims for the extreme left of a formation at all times.

It is a shame because the scope of this game is great, and no one else had done a project like Empire, but that is solely what makes it playable. Had CA any competition, Empire would have failed.

This game requires strategy. This isn`t another Call of Duty Game. Because if you use Call of Duty tactics, those brave horsemen on your team will be lying dead on the ground in no time. SO whatever you do, think logically. (e.g. Bringing ranged soldiers into close quarters combat). If you like startegy games that pay off for every action that is sucessful, I think this will become a great addition to your Steam Library, like it is for me :)

Buy this one on sale and it might be worth your time. I judge a game mostly by a few factors, #1 is replayability, #2 is depth, #3 is enjoyment factor, #4 Graphics.

I played many good games back in the stone age of gaming that had crappy graphics but the game was still fun and you could play it again and again and it would still hold on to it's appeal.

33,16605432,english,"I've played a ton on a diffrent steam account but because i went inactive on that account it delted itself :(. Anyways, Empire Total War :D what can i say it's awesome. It feels real, not by the game itself but by what the game does, you actually feel like your in the late 1700s ruling a government. The Ships, Troops, City managment, map layout and everything is downright perfect. My only complaint is diplomacy, i kinda always wanted it to have an animated leader like in Civilization V, otherwise no complaints its also perfect. 

What does this game stand out in? 

-Combat is realistic. This game has put in so much detail in the littlest things, its just perfect. I feel like im on the battelfeild during the 1700s. 

-Weather. A game like this has weather? yes, and it goes according to season. It doesn't have weather like rain, hurricans, etc. but for every season the enviorment changes. During the summer there is no snow, during the fall snow starts to come down in the north, and in winter all the normal places that get snow during the winter have it. Spring starts to show melting everywhere and then it repeats. This took some time to do and it really deserves credit cause it makes it realistic :) 

-Nations. This game has all the most important nations, major, minor, you name it of the entire 1700s in their realistic spots on the map and with their territories already put out. That had to take a LONG time to do like seriously, it's great to see all these natons. 

What is some stuff you don't like about the game? 

Nations- With the Darthmod Empire mod you get to do allot more and i believe the game should have allowed these options from the start. Nations like the newly born United States of America should have been in the normal version of the game for you to play as during normal gameplay. I do have to complain about that.

Otherwise the game still is great on its own. I HIGHLY recommend that you buy the entire game for $17 or better yet just pay $5 for the game when it's on sale cause it's a very good stragedy game.",1434923243,1434923243,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198154456797,49,4,10393,0,132,1535426279

49,16511400,english,"Total War is one of the most popular and best strategy game series around. A series that has tackled many time periods and settings such as the Roman Empire, Medevial, and Greece. It is not suprising that they tried to bring the series to the ever popular 1700s European setting. While games such as Age of Empire 3 thrived in this era, Total War falls apart. 

Pros: well there really aren't any. Any thing positive I can say for this game, other games in the series do better. 

Cons: well for one, the game is HORRIBLY optimised. I can max out Total War: Shogun 2, a newer game, but even on the lowest settings this game lags... on the campaign map. That's right, this game has issues smoothly running the WORLD MAP! Admitingly, Total War's campaign maps have always been more detailed than other series, trying to make the map look somewhat like an actual overview of the real world area, but still there isn't that much going on there. This problem is even worse in combat, where even the smallest battles can slow you down. God help you if there are more than about 10 units on screen at a time. The AI is AWFUL. Not only do your opponates have no sense of self-preservation, but your own units struggle to follow even your most basic commands. Trying to get units to hide behind cover confuses them more than just about anything. Also, the whole point of Total War games is formation based combat. While this works wonderfully in the pre-gun eras, here it is painful. All you have to do is line your troops up and wait for the enemy to come to you. Thanks to the poor AI they will walk straight up to you and not even bother to flank or surround and only load their guns when they are in range of your units. This means that often times your side can get 2 volleys into them before they fire back. This basically ruins any real sense of pride in your victory because it's borderline forced apon you. You have to try if you want to lose a battle. However, things are differnet in the world map. Here, your enemies watch you, and do a good job of taking undefended bases. This is the only time the game feels like it truly is a Total War game. Unfortunatly, it is drug down by making the diplomacy system laugable at best. Does a country hate you? Don't worry, all you need to do if gift them 10000 gold or so and they'll love you! Diplomacy has always been the weakest part of Total War games, but here it doesn't even really count as diplomacy. It really feels like you're in preschool and some kid hates you so you give him a gummybear and now you're friends. It's pathetic in every sense of the word. On TOP of all this, the game is broken, with units glitching through walls, units randomly not shooting (even when they have ammo and can hit their targets), and sometimes just ignoring your commands. 

TL:DL- Total War is an amazing seires, don't let this awful game trick you into thinking otherwise. Do yourself a favor and pick up Shogun 2 or Rome 1. I've tried many mods and even worked on it myself and in the end it's still a broken mess.

With -The Americas, Europe, India, and four ocean trade arenas the campaign map is a sprawling magnificent thing. It isn't quite the global total war game I'd always wanted but it's the closest they have ever come in scope. 

However, the battles don't play as well as the Fall of the Samurai would manage for Shogun 2, the campaign doesn't have the flow of later titles, or the tight focus of the earlier ones. All and all the game is the awkward middle child of the series, and doesn't benefit from it.

5,15405092,english,"Firstly, I have been a long time fan of the Total War series and have played since Rome II and every subsequent title since. I can say that this expansion is easily within my top three favorite TW games. This game has a few typical flaws found in earlier TW games, but overall is a solid experience. I have a few personal preferences that some might find annoying, I shall still list these in the Pro's column as it's my review and I'll do what I want. 
[u] Pro [/u] 
1) Diverse faction choives: TONS of factions to choose from, each with its own unique advantages/disadvantages. For example, the mryiad includes; the Ottoman Empire, Great Britain, The Iroquis Confederacy, and The Maratha Confederacy (to name a few). Unlike many TW games, the units are diverse and not merely rewraps of the same one unit. 

2) Awesome Economy!: At first I struggled to find a decent balance between my army maint. and income level when I first started out. However unlike most TW games, where the economic balance can seem daunting to beginners, I found this title to be pleasently forgiving. For veteran players, be prepared to make a TON of money, especially through trading. I can not express how paramount trading in this TW title. One note that many will find annoying, to upgrade your farms, mines, etc. you must click on each indv resource that is located around the map. For example, in Shogun 2 your farms are located winthin your city, along with any extra resources, in Empire only your military/admin. building is and you are forced to keep track of literally dozens of different resources. I like this personally, simply because it is cool to see your empire become more prosperous. 

3) Tons of land: Like tons, three different theatres; India, Europe and America. This means a lot of gameplay and conquering, oh the fun you'll have. 

[u] Cons [/u]
1: Stupid AI: The AI, like in many earlier releases, is not the most adpet at military combat. While sometimes I have been throughly suprised, I have never truly been threatened as I have in similiar titles playing on the hardest difficuly. Sadly, some of your major powers, like the Maratha Confederacy over time lose the ability to fight advanced troops like the Europeans. 

2: Lag/Crash: I have yet to play a game through without experiencing three crashes. Some games have taken me 50+ hours and to be consistently crashing gets old fast. I will say it is nothing to pre-patched Rome II. 

Consensus: If you are even a remote TW fan, then buy this game. You will have loads of fun and many hours to frolic across the world.",1429213649,1433007962,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198031419614,201,4,11206,0,10888.0,1483415833

13,16029480,english,"Firstly, I should say, I really like Empire:Total War. For the longest time, I considered Rome 1 the best Total War game as it was simple to grasp & you could focus entirely on the battles, manage cities or both. 

Empire:Total War was a purchase for a new strategy, I needed a new challenge. The introductory campaign was short & got the basics of tactics & control across well, but Empire:Total War is all about it's Grand Campaign, which is simply to conquer a set number of states or cities by a certain year. It's about 200 turns away from the start, plenty of time, but not so much you can be overly complacent.

The great elements of the Total War games are present; watching individual men fighting it out on the battle field, huge campaign areas (Actually, Europe, India & America are all major theatres), the very Civilization Game trait of encyclopedic entries on buildings & units & bitter enemies who are actually bent on destroying you. Empire adds naval battles, scientific research, Gentlemen who can duel with each other & the three areas to do battle in.

Unlike most of Empire's detractors, I enjoy the naval battles, because it forces you to think as a naval commander would have, which is very different to how a commander of land based armies thinks, & so requires a flexible, adaptable mind. For me, being forced to switch from commanding land-based forces, to the mind set of naval command & then back again is a chellenge for the RTS gamer in itself, never mind the battles themselves. The era of muskets & cannons is a nice change of pace from the previous ancient eras of the Medieval & Rome games.

I've completed it twice & racked up well over 200 hours at the time of writing & that is simply because I was always planning my next move, be that war & conquest, or consolidation & development, & I wanted to know if I had out-thought my enemy or mustered a large enough force to take the various objectives I'd set myself.

The only flaw in Empire specifically that really grates is the occasional, sometimes regular, crash to desktop that is well known about & you soon get in the habit of saving often, just in case. In fact I once lost several hours of effort after a crash.

The other flaw is a typical Total War failing; the AI. It does lack serious tactical nous. It never lines up it's forces in (what I think) to make the best use of the units it possesses & is happy to throw units at you with no subtlety at all. Sadly, the Total War AI has always seemed to be a generation behind the games.

That said, I really like Empire:Total War. Days & days of continuous strategic thinking can be invested & I found myself considering my next move in my mind on the way to work on several occasions.

This game takes place in the colonial era. So guns play a rather large role in this, and because of the era the guns are mostly single shot muzzle loaders. There are also melee infantry, hoursemen (both armed with fire arms and melee weapons) , and artillery of varying caliber. 

Landscape is very important in this game because of the surplus of ranged units. Hight as in most games will help your ranged units and slow the advance of melee infantry. Artillery is also helped by being put on hills and the like.

In all honesty melee is not as important in this game as in others. But melee troops are still very useful. Because most units are ranged a melee unit can very quickly destroy their moral or the unit in general. But this goes the same both ways because of the ranged unit being well ranged. So melee are best for ambushes or holding walls.

One of the cons i mentioned above is that moral seems really fragile. Units can brake in a mater of SECONDS. This would be ok if it was mere cannon fodder but even the most elite of units can be broken after one or two volleys of fire then at other times they charge though no problem. The moral system seems unstable and inconstant.  -1 point 

As mentioned above all the factions are relatively balance because they share alot of units with small changes. The only faction that is at both a disadvantage and an advantage is the Indian nations. Because they are over all more stealthy they are good for ambushes, they also have better melee units from the start of the game, but their range is a lot lower then the European nations.

The online is very laggy if more then two players are involved. This is rather common in total war games. So unless playing 1 on 1 online or playing though LAN i would recommend not putting your hopes into online -.5 points
A small complaint i also have is the lack of online campaign. Many other total war games both before and after have this feature.

As mentioned above the unit to unit comparison is very rock paper scissors. But many strategy games are like this and with proper strategy and high ground advantage it can be changed.
so because you can counter it I think it evens out.
so over all i think it is a 8.5/10",1397695518,1432443473,True,8,0,0.529865562915802002,3,True,False,False,76561198126636708,278,5,1184,0,1131.0,1538200935

However I did have issues conquering the entire world however in a game pic I proved that it is possible. The game at several points wouldn't give me an end turn button and game crashed a few times as well... It took some doing. However for the most part it was mostly due to my empire being so freakishly large. The game works awesomely other wise. Takes some effort getting use to it. Also a word of advice playing the battles out can be a world of difference in most cases. Some if it says your going to win just auto it otherwise you could lose. However fight most of them out...

59,15665100,english,"kindly looks over the battlefield and smiles, the flanks are secure, the cannons are wailing away, your ally is holding their side, and your abushes are working. At this point you believe it is all in the bag and that the enemy general should simply hand in their formal resignation to their monarchg immediatly and then be killed for treas9on and cowardess. 

You sit back and think 'soda' you go to your fridge and get a pepsi still smiling until you see your screen.

 Your ambushes have been killed, your allys line is shattered, and your cannons have had a firm horse charge up the ass. Being the quick tactictian you first look for the cause. Obviously it was your absence and your allys incompetence, but you look deeper, how did your incompetant ally get broken that quickly when they were safe before hand? 

after a few seconds of searching the battle field you see what has caused this, one unit of Indian war elephants flanked him and then went beserk on his anus. You sigh and quickly send a few men to kill this threat.

Next would be how your flanks became exposed enough for a quick cavalry blitz onto your cannons, your mouth drops open as you see the tiny hole in your line infantry, a hit and run. After you close this hole you turn your attention to how your ambushes got thwarted. 

You knew that the ambushes were temporary but you did not know the enemy would single them out and kill them vicously. Your eyes dart over the area that they were in, seems to your quick glance that the enemy had used light artys with some scout cavalry to do this, you send 1 units of scout cavalry to look for this.

In the meantime your units have murdered the elephants, HUZZA. your incompetant ally reforms his now rather small line, you order him to march foward. He says that might not be a great idea with the mens moral low, you insist that he goes in for the glory of your mother country. He sighs and moves his small rabble of troops forward. 

You scouts have found the enemy artys and to your great pleasure they seem unguarded. You keep your scouts in cover and sneak them closer. you decide that YOLO does apply to cavalry charges and send them straight for the poor bastards. SUCESS, much rejoicing was done in the scout cavalry unit, they only lost half of their men! a sacrafice well worth it.

you get a skype call from the enemy, you are now smiling for you believe you can gloat for you victory. you answer and begin with, ""so now we both have no art""... your enemy is angry and exclaims that his mother country is better than yours, in disgust you kick him out of the call and focus on killing his troops with no rhyme or reason.

Suddenly the silence is broken by your mens screams of terror and pain, you look at your main line and your enemy just dropped gas on your whole clump of troops. The enemy mortars hiden so well at the back of them map are now pounding your troops with gas. Angered by this act of cruelty you send all cavalry units to deal with this threat. 

You hear the whinying of your cavalry dying, more bloody Indian war elephants have appeared in mass and are having a mass bouty call on your cavalry. Between the gas and the elephants your men have been slaughtered. about 5 squads remain, you reform these precious troops together in some woods where your devilish enemy cannot see them.

3 skirmisher squads (two of which are out of ammo), one tenth of a heavy cavalry unit, and a random bunch of canon opperators who had fled after the horse charge who decided to stop fleeing. Pondering for awhile you come up with a plan to destroy the enemy. 

sending your units through the woods you watch sympathetically as your ally is murdered by the enslaught of gas and elephants. He retreats after killing half of the elephants. He regroups his one unit with your group of lonely vaganbonds exclaimg that you told him to go forward and that you got him killed.. honwstly you dont really care, you congragulate him on killing half the elephants and tell him to buck up for the mother country. He bucks up, you then look at his one unit of sharpshooters which had been using melee during the whole battle and had not fired a single shot. Although this is stupid and you feel like you hsould chide your ally for his continual incompetance you realize this could be useful, you tell him to follow you.

You reach the elephant killing ground and send your two dud skirm troops up on melee mode, as per usual the elephants appear and charge, you tell your ally to use his sharps to fire. elephants begin to die in droves. in the meantime your cavalry units are probbing those damned mortars so hard. The enemys general begins to run across the map trying to make a wild goose chase. A signle satisfying round of cannon fire is heard as your mishmashed canonners fire the last shoot. THE PERFECT HIT, your twit of an advisor announces that the enemy general is nowinfact dead, a fact that you saw an enjoyed very much so. With this victory the enemy elephants evacuate the premises and the enemy has been slain.

Just another day in the life of a master strategist
10/10 would have my time wasted by dumb friends not being competant enough to hold their line vs one elephant again

Do I recommend this game? Yes.

This game is my favorite of the series. Seeing your calvary charge in and the enemy general become the world's first man to the moon is a very gratifying experience. The siege game play is mediocre and buggy but the full out land battles are the best of any series. The naval battles are also well done, I mostly make big fleets and autoresolve them, because I am not that good at them. My best campaign I have done was where I conquered the entire Islamic world, converted everyone to Protestantism and saved the Campaign as ""George W. Bush"" The thing is, with this huge of a map, you can do anything to that scale and volume. With the other Total Wars, religion doesn't matter, with this game it really does, and can be the difference between a happy people, and a rebellion. Another great feature in this game is revolutions. It adds so much depth and fun to the game. (When I become the Republic of France I think I had a lot less bloody revolution.)

I like the era, it's just that there isn't much strategy involved, it's pretty easy to just keep maneuvering your units into better firing positions. The fact it's the gun powder era isn't the problem, I've played Shogun 2 Fall of the Samurai & had a lot of fun, this however just doesn't play out well at all. It might just be that the setting doesn't interest me as much as a Japanese one, and the fact that there are little to none melee units to allow for more strategies.

The naval combat however is a blast. I definatly had a lot of fun playing naval battles. The ones on Empire are really a lot of fun, naval strategies is usually my weak point too.

But overall, in my opinion, the game is a bore. I'll keep trying to play it to try to find some enjoyment out of it, but I doubt I will, and will most likely return to another Total War game. - I'm gonna put the review as not recommended, but if you really like the era, & wouldn't enjoy the more older fighting style Total Wars, then I'd recommend Empire to you.

96,15334692,english,"Firstly, I think I've played enough hours of this game to let you know I like it. Empire was the first Total War game I played and it has had me addicted to strategy ever since. The period in which it is set I find very interesting and the wide range of units you can use in combat (late game) makes the battles more interesting. However, the battles feel very slow and the AI could be better.

The diplomacy system is probably my least favourite part of the game as the AI are not very flexible and it is very difficult to get a deal out of them, nothing peturbing them unless you stand outside their last region with an army Napoleon himself would have been proud of. 

My favourite part of the game is the campaign map itself, spanning Europe and North Africa, the Middle East, India and the Americas (or at least most of it). I would have liked the game to incorporate more of the map as regions to be controlled rather than have the rest of the known world as trade theatres. 

It is very enjoyable to play the game with most of the available nations, however, access to minor nations does not come with the vanilla game so I would get an all factions mod to enhance your experience. The Warpath Campaign is also a fun DLC worth the buy. 

For someone who is looking to get into strategy games, this is a good starting point. If you are looking for something with better battles I prefer the older Total War games of Rome and Medieval 2. If you are looking for a game which solely focuses on campaign strategy I would recommend a Paradox game, i.e Europa Universalis. Even if you do get one of the other games, this is still a great addition to have.

Not too sure what to write here so heres a recipe for Pancakes instead

Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
3 tablespoons sugar
1 tablespoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon freshly ground nutmeg
2 large eggs, at room temperature
1 1/4 cups milk, at room temperature
1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
3 tablespoons unsalted butter, plus more as needed

Now to make it
1. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and nutmeg.
2. In another bowl, beat the eggs and then whisk in the milk and vanilla.
3. Melt the butter in a large cast iron skillet or griddle over medium heat.
4. Whisk the butter into the milk mixture. Add the wet ingredients to the flour mixture, and whisk until a thick batter is just formed
5. Keeping the skillet at medium heat, ladle about 1/4 cup of the batter onto the skillet, to make a pancake. Make 1 or 2 more pancakes, taking care to keep them evenly spaced apart. Cook, until bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, and the undersides are golden brown, about 2 minutes. Flip with a spatula and cook about 1 minute more on the second side. Serve immediately or transfer to a platter and cover loosely with foil to keep warm. Repeat with the remaining batter, adding more butter to the skillet as needed.

During winter battles FPS droppes to 0.2 :D even with the lowest details (unplayable whole winter battles, da), but other battles ""work"".

51,15075238,english,"I'm revisiting this game after taking a break for a couple years and now I remember why I stopped.  This game should be pretty awesome.  

Pros:  It's one of the few strategy / RTS games that tackle this time period and specifically focus on the American revolution.  Despite what others say, the units make sense since there was lots of a trade and conquering - you should have the ability to have the same technology through and through.  Also, if it wasn't balanced, the British would just win every game.  But...

CONS: So many.  This game is broken.  First off, the improvements are largely annoying and require 10 minutes of reading to figure out what they do.  The AI will randomly declare war on you which is just not realistic, a common mistake in strategy games.  Advisors/scientists/agents etc are a good idea but in this case they don't clearly do much of anything, window dressing.  Including India etc but then completely ignoring Africa (probably out of political correctness) - seriously though, the colonies wouldn't exist the way they did without that trade route, even as horrific as it was.  But colonists can magically sail to India - right!

You could look past all of this and just do battle and have a great time. That's if the battle system worked.  The AI on both sides is laughable.  Most of the time they sit around.  Even your units that you order, they just sit there.  Sometimes if they are engaged, they will stop and just get slaughtered.  Sometimes an enemy will run through their lines (in retreat) and they just sit there.  Like "" oh, that's weird, there goes the enemy, oh well"".  Often the enemy will just sit out in no where or in side castle and not do anything.  You could be winning and your army will lose confidence and run away.  You could masterfully out maneuver a powerful enemy and you should win but then you don't because your guys that are winning get scared???    

This should be a 2.99 game.  Or they could fix it but it's probably too late.  I recall the early Total War games being a lot more solid.

For those of you looking for a great total war video on its many problems I recommend Dr. Reynold Sanity on youtube.  If you can stand Australian cynical and somewhat offensive humor he makes a lot of great points.  Nails it on the head.

For the price I would pick the game up but just watch your calavary chase after a routed unit and yea.....  Watch as the entire unit chases one man while the others run in the opossite direction and then just sit around.  Even after uncountable patches this game is still rather messy.  The AI while no longer creating armies of 7 cannons and a single skirmisher (not all the time) is a bit better, they are still pretty bad even by total war standards.  On the plus side they will form large fleets and armies.  Id ignore the campain all together.  It culminates in fighting a British army who only buys native horse musketmen who are the best guys you want to gaurd a fort and man the wall.  

Random agent spawning is frustrating as well.  Still if you like the time period get it or napoleon.  Stay away from Rome 2.  While many praise shogun 2 for its polish it is still hurt by the warscape engines lack of collision detection and only allowing 1vs1 melee.  Enjoy watching your men circle a single unit and get cut down one at a time.  

For the last great melee total war you want medievil 2.  Although Shogun is pretty solid.  They just need to really overhaul or just go back to the old engine with better looking models.

91,14802908,english," First of this is a long review but this is nothing but the truth about this game. I saw empire and i am kinda new to the total war franchise. i saw total war empire and i thought it would be a pretty decent game. I look up reviews on the game and sadly i saw a lot of hate. Now that was a long time ago and it has been a couple years since the game came out so i thought i would give it a go hoping all the bugs would be patched. I was wrong.......
The game is a mess still after all these years! I thought they would fix the AI and all the bugs but nope! The AI are awful just a disaster. The AI run straight and run away from your troops and dont even attack.  I spent an one hour playin ghtis game and I had to quit because the battle were so boring. I think the civil war is awesome and really cool but not like this when all the troops wont even attack and im standing there with one unit and still win the war because the army doesnt attack me. 
Next the game is so bad it hurts to play the game. The map is a wreck, you get so much men to start out with so you can take over the cities right next to you and demolish them like no problem if they even let you blow down the doors since the cannons dont like moving after you shoot something and decide to shoot a hill instead of moving and attack the gates. The gameplay is so basic on the campaign map and doesnt give you those heart pounding moments like you have on medieval 2 or shogun 2. You start out with like 5 alliances and those alliances wont even help you. Instead they will just sit back while im getting my ass kicked by the french. I signed a treaty with you to help me not sit around and watch my city fall to some other faction you are also fighting! Next when you get higher in level it takes five hours just for all the factions to take there turns. Ive watched youtube more then i was playing the game waiting for my turn to come. 
The concept is great rewriting history and not let america gain its independance or ally with america as the british and go crazy and fight the british or something. I was impressed with how much they gave a lot of detail on the battle grounds with the little stuff like rocks all over the place, broken down walls for your men to take cover behind while there firing bullets, forests to hide and set up ambushed and flanks on the enemy. The total war series does a fantastic job with units and how many units there are and how you can get some epic fights that take a long time like how it was back then. Sadly this game is missing so much that im actually sad that this is my first total war game i didnt like. I am still a big total war fan and will get all the games but empire was so bad and were missing so many key factors to make this game a good game and instead made this bad and not fun to play. Get shogun 2 or medieval 2 and lets hope that they will make a fun civil war game. Hope they do great concept just bad game. Ill be waiting sega!

This game is impossibly broken still, after all these years... The AI makes little sense most of the time, but by far the worst are the siege battles. Most  battles they sit outside my walls refusing to attack, only occasionally sending one or two units forward to die. This means your game session has what basically comes down to 20-minute pauses every single time someone sieges your cities, while you sit there fast-forwarding...

Equally annoying is the RNG auto-resolving battles. It doesn't matter at all how large your force is or by what margin you could win if you fought the battle yourself; you can easily end up losing 1000 troops to a 300-strong enemy force if the RNG gods demand it!

To top it off there are actually performance issues on my 2-month-old and very powerful new PC. This COULD have been a good game, but is badly let down by its stupid AI. This has completely turned me off ever buying another Total War game...

0,9999147,english,"I had played Rome TW (brilliant) and Medieval 2 TW (also brilliant) for a good few years before trying Empire.  I was unsure whether the radical transition in technology would still offer gameplay I found interesting which is why I put it off for some while.  The RTS battles are indeed completely different and took a while to get used to but the learning curve itself was very enjoyable and it doesn't take long to get used to the different fighting style.

The large campaign map, while daunting at first, is the perfect next step in a TW game and there is great satisfaction to be had in nuturing a faction from humble begginings to a mighty empire.

The sea battles are very fluid and surprisingly realistic for The Creative Assembly's first attempt (I have not tried Napoleon TW, not sure how the two compare on this front).

My only issue with Empire TW is that there is a step away from the intricate historical detail shown in previous titles.  Rome TW and Medieval 2 TW were both very educational in a passive, subliminal kind of way.  It was almost impossible not to learn about the time period and this is something I loved.  Empire TW does not have this to quite the same extent (still above and beyond most other strategy titles) which is not likely to be an issue to most as I imagine most aren't even interested in this factor (maybe I need to get out more?).

Anyway, this game is an impeccable title in a brilliant francise.  I picked this up together with Shogun 2 TW in an offer around £7 and if this is available for a price under £15 it is well worth it.  Even if you are not a fan of startegy games, picking this up when on offer is an absolute must.  

Oh, and try Rome TW and Medieval TW as well!  Good day!",1399052423,1425516589,True,1,0,0.500596344470977783,0,True,False,False,76561198053412533,113,2,3941,0,3897.0,1418776438
1,14735047,english,"Ok I should start by saying I actually love the total war series that I have played so far albeit that only includes Shogun 2 and now Empire for me, of which my friends who are into this genre tell me are the best of the total war franchise so far. I have only played 3-4 hours so far so this is more of a first look.

Empire for the sale price was in my opinion a damn good buy, It defiantly adds plus points for value, I’m not sure I would have been happy if I paid full price for this when it first came out though. There are a few bugs and glitches that do make for a laugh but honestly after this long I would have expected them patched out.

Some bugs I have encountered so far include my troops refusing to stand down or hold a line, and this really annoying one where when you try to move groups of troops at the same time some will just walk off into the void, the target line for their positioning is nowhere near where you clicked and often in a completely opposite direction, meaning you have to micromanage your troops when you shouldn’t have to, it kinds of breaks the fun of commanding an army when you have to look at each person and tell them…hey you go there, you over there, you follow him etc.  

This game is heavy on forward planning and strategy, it is important to move your troops into strong positions and either advance on the enemy or wait for them to come to you. There is also the world map from which makes different style of play, this is fun as you can engage in diplomacy and lay siege to forts rather than have to play each battle if you don’t want to (though you can engage each one if you choose). 

The ship combat is fun and has lots of different weapons and tactics to employ in order to gain the advantage, although the path route problem sometimes rears its ugly head again so you end up micromanaging each ship, and even then you have to keep an eye on it to make sure it is doing what you want. 

The setting is in the colony era for America and I have to say always one of the more interesting historical periods, there is a lot of lore about all different unit types, the battles themselves and the ships of which I have a good interest.

If you are into strategy, or history or both then this will probably interest you, I would pick it up on sale though as paying more than £10 for this would be a mistake in my opinion. 

I’ll definably be taking more of a look into this and may update this once I have tried the grand campaign out.

What a game. What a serie. 

For those who missed this long and legendary train, you will have to know that the romance with this serie started in the year 2000 with Shogun Total War. A complete wargame where you could conquer Japan with an army of samurai or japenese warrior monks. And what a show it was at the time.

Empire Total War is the dignified successor from 2009. Forget Japan, now, it is time for the American continent, Europe, North Africa, Asia... Forget the Noble, proud and fierce samurais. You will have to make do with line infantry armed with muskets. 

As usual, it is turn based strategy where you decide where to move your units, choose the building to build, recruit troops. Mixed with real time strategy and tactics. Do not forget. Battles are won before the battle. This is real strategy. Once the enemy is at your doors, you fight with the army you already have, not the army you want.

Naval battles are not forgotten. You wont be able to act blaze and cool with these beauties. You will enjoy watching the crew running around while the ships are under enemy fire. And forget esthetics. Naval battles are extremely interesting. Will you use brutish firepower to win the day? Or will you use speed and agility? You will have to mind the battle morale of your men, as battle can destroy their will to fight faster than he can destroy their bodies. 

Will you use cannon balls to destroy their hulls and canons? Or will you use other munitions to destroy sails and crew? Will you risk a boarding action to add swords and light arms to the canons? Or will you rather see their ships sunk forfeiting the prizes for captured vessels?

I will be up to you to decide.

Here are a few features you have to know about:
- Scientific research: Choose the technologies you want to research first. Do you want baionett on your rifles to see you infantry survive more often in meele? Or do you want farming equipment to boosts revenue and population growth? Better artillery maybe? 
- Diplomacy: Make trade arrangements with some countries. Make vassals, negociate technology exchanges. 
- See your troops gain experience gunning from a battle to another. Your soldiers will be prouder (less prone to morale break) and deadlier (faster reloaded, stronger defense abilities).
- Hire generals and see your actions on the battlefield affect their skills.
- Hire from a a large choice of different units. Do you want to fight in the open with line infantry or do you want to skirmish with light infantry from a far. Do you want elite units or can you make do with cheaper to maintain militias? Cavalry and artillery are not forgotten. From mortars to cannons, from melee infantry to Dragoons. Do you want exotic units? Capture far away lands and hire special units of mercenaries and introduce their deadly skills to your enemies nightmares.
- Every structure and unit have page with statistics and historical data. You will learn a lot playing this game. The experience will definetely make your richer.

There are so many features to list... Anyway: This game is a must have for every strategy lover. You will see the hard work of the developpers and their attention to details. And following our ""medieval ideology"" they deserve our full support and it would be a shame to miss to explore their work. Kudos to the makers of this great game.

So after I beat the russian i took a fleat of ships, loaded them all with line infantry and canons, went to north america attacked the 13 colonies took all there land but also now my british are at war with me so I saild a few ships and army there took them all out, they offer me a peace treaty so I accepted it. Now my empire is really strong I feel unbeatable so I started a campaign on the ottomans lost half of my men against farmers with pitch forks (I had line infantry), finally i took one of the citys of the ottomans. But it was not long untill 3 armys attack my new conquered city, they all have elephants with poeple riding on them with guns so now I lost the battle so my city was recaptured my the ottomans. Now its my turn so I send my men down south to attak the ottomans I attack some of there armys and farms, I could not move my men down any more so i end the turn, all of a sudden the austrian declared war on me, so now I need to attack from 2 fronts. After about 10 turns ottomens and austrian took all of my captured rusian citys, they pushed my back all the way to the motherland, now im fucked I half of my army is at north america fighting, so what i did was I loaded all of my men into ships and saild back the sweden it took me a few turns but good thing my men manage to hold the invaders back. So now my whole army is at the motherland, first I tried to make a peace treaty with them but the dident accept so I sent my men to attack but lost to the ottomens now im really fucked (at the mean time i lost all my Citys to the natives) so I loaded my last few ships and men and sailed for india I got there after a few turns i attack the united provinces small island in india won the battle also at the same time my main city in sweden was captured by the ottomens good thing i won the battle with the united provinces or it would have kicked my out of the game.

71,14285733,english,"I have mixed feelings about this game and its sequel, Napoleon.

On the one hand, they explore a time period (1700-1815) that's sadly neglected in games. It's a rich and fascinating epoch that includes the rise and fall of huge empires, the first global conflicts like the Seven Years War, the intellectual and cultural revolution of the Enlightenment, the shift from an age of highly-regulated ""limited warfare"" to massive armies based on conscription, the birth of the United States, the French Revolution, and so on. ETW spans the entire 18th century, and had the potential to be a grand-scale masterpiece.

In some ways, it delivers on that promise, especially with the help of mods (Darthmod is an absolute must). It has a huge campaign map that spans three continents, naval battles, land battles with thousands of infantrymen slugging it out to the accompaniment of artillery fire and cavalry charges, streamlined diplomacy, and a complex tech tree. Wars in ETW have a distinctly 18th-century flavor to them: colonial conflicts turn into battles for global mastery, while coalitions of great powers form intricate webs of alliances. The modded AI puts up a good fight, and will take over your colonies and wreck your trade if you're not careful.

But the world in Empire and Napoleon just doesn't feel as vibrant and alive as it did in Rome 1 and Medieval 2, which preceded ETW. In Medieval 2, your faction leader and his/her heirs were playable characters, as were merchants, diplomats, assassins, priests, and so on. There were crusades, marriages, heretics, and the Pope to worry about, and managing your settlements had some real depth to it. Each faction felt unique thanks to the voice-acting and a rich variety of specialty units. There were world-changing events like the Mongol invasion and bubonic plague.

Most of that is gone in Empire. Your faction leaders are almost invisible, relegated to a ""Government"" screen, and only give some abstract bonuses to things like unit upkeep. Diplomats, merchants, and settlement-building have been pretty much ""streamlined"" out of the game entirely. There are no game-changing events like the Roman Civil War or the Mongol Invasion to liven things up in the midgame. 

Factions feel identical. It doesn't matter if you're playing as Prussia, France, the Ottoman Empire, or Great Britain; all factions have the same units (line infantry and a few flavors of cavalry and artillery), without any real strengths or weaknesses. The only difference is your starting position.

Maybe the biggest letdown is the impact technologies have on your faction. I think it would have been brilliant move to have industrial and Enlightenment advances give you economic boosts at the expense of public order (workers' uprisings / strikes, upper-class coups and revolutions). After all, this is what happened in history. But instead, the ""clamor for reform"" penalties are so slight as to hardly make a difference. Researching Fire by Rank makes a bigger impact on the game than Utilitarianism or The Rights of Man, or industrial technology that would have destroyed older crafts or uprooted peasants.

ETW also does nothing to model the historical problems faced by huge empires of the time. Constant wars and over-expansion are encouraged; there's no penalties on public order as long as you're winning. In reality, though, even a successful 18th-century war could leave a nation spent and destabilized: the American Revolution was caused by the costs of Britain's victory in the Seven Years' War, and in turn the French Revolution was caused in part by the costs of aid to the United States. It would've been great to see a risk/reward factor in place - expand at the risk of uprisings at home and abroad. This could have led to a more elastic mid/late game, and would have added an extra dimension to strategy. In Medieval and Rome, you really feel like you're traversing an entire era of human history; in Empire, a hundred years pass, but the world hardly seems to change at all.

Finally, ETW and Napoleon both lack some of the extra polish and flavor that earlier games had. Unmodded, the soundtrack is dull and repetitive. The lack of period music is just baffling to me, and the voice acting is stale and leaves much to be desired. Factions, units, and settlements feel copy-pasted; it's all the same, just with slightly different coats of paint. And even though the battles feel authentic, both games have a toy soldier vibe to them; they lack the grit and brutality of the other entries in the series.

After several hundred hours, both Empire and Napoleon feel like a letdown. They're not bad at all, and they're worth playing just for a chance to explore a neglected historical period. But every time I play them, I can't shake the regret that they could have been so much more.",1422821166,1422821166,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198000525316,161,6,17232,0,17060.0,1447030288

15,14027297,english,"Ugh, such mixed feelings on this game. The problem with pretty much all the total war games is that they do some things really well, and other things really poorly.

Empire is not really a bad game, and I kind of have to recommend it given that I certainly got well more than an hour of entertainment for each dollar I spent. I would probably recommend Medieval II over it if you are looking to get into the total war game, as it's probably the best of them in terms of design.

The worst aspect of Empire is the building management. Everything is strewn all over the place, and you have to spend a bunch of time finding each building site in order to upgrade anything. This kinda sucks in an empire building game, which this pretty indisputably is. All the other total war games get this right with varying degrees of success, but here Empire just fails horribly.

The best part of Empire is that it is probably the best balanced of the TW games. There is no overpowering faction you can just dominate with. This is sort of a mixed bag, because it is achieved by all the units being nearly identical, but it does make the game an actual challenge on higher difficulties.

All in all, there are lots of good things about this game, and if you play Paradox games then you will probably enjoy it.

31,13917942,english,"The game is definitely worth checking out. I really like various historicaly based detailes poping up during gameplay, which are also nation specific. Great touch.
Battle rules are a little different than other total war games, mostly due to firearms usage. 
Empire has different way to use regions. Beside the capital city there are towns which develop over time and can be used to increase happiness in region, income, convert to different religion, or build research facility. Those towns can be raided and damaged.

Cons:
Very limited usefullnes of agents. there are 3 types of agents and each has 1 or 2 actions which you might find usefull. It could have been more developed.
Diplomacy options are very limited from my point of view, and I have not noticed any specific value in terms of victory conditions (allies, portectorate).
Battle placements. Chosing a place of the battle on campaign map has little value as the area is poorly reflected on battle map. I think it is a breat loss.
Additional battle fortifications are rarely ever available and sometimes have weird consequences eg. artilery after fortifying cannot be moved and even change of angle is very limited. It certainly does not look like it should.

47,13816213,english,"First of all, this is my very first experience with the Total War franchise. So, as a noob and as not having any convictions about the game going in or any kind of nostalgia toward the previous titles, my opinion on Empire is one removed from any ""fanboy-isms"" or any kind of on-going irritations with the series. Second of all I didn't have any deep pre-conceived ideas about what I was going to get when I started playing the game and was only interested in the concept and the overall experience I would have over few weeks I guessed I would spend playing it.

So from the time I began to play Empire until now 100 hours later while I'm writing this review I can say that it impressed me thoroughly the entire time I was playing it. The game had a depth that I hadn't seen or expected from the campaign map and I began to find myself pouring over my taxes and the constuction of buildings in the provinces that I was beginning to dominate. The time spent not being in battle felt even more important than the battles themselves and the relationships you need to have with the computer controlled nations ultimately dicatate the length of time that it takes to control all of the territory of the world you need to acheive victory. I will say that this part of the game must've taken a lot of thought and input from many developers with extensive knowledge of the history of the 18th century as well as having more than the most basic understanding of how governments and the global economy at the time should be handled in a strategy game. The campaign map is full of so many choices that you as the ruler of the nation can hardly dismiss because if you do there are always consequences. It was very easy for me to waste 45 minutes at a time on one turn making sure that I did absolutely every single thing on the campaign map that I had meant to do for that one turn so that I would still have enough income on the next turn to be able to assault Calcutta and destroy the Mughal Empire once and for all after 50 hours of time fighting them back across the continent of India. 

The game is very deep and a campaign will take you far more than one or two sessions to complete no matter how long you choose to sit in front of your computer screen. The more preparation and time that you spend thinking about any one area of the game will reflect an overall sort of identity of the nation that you ultimately will build. You might have the worlds greatest army but your people hate you and revolt every time you click the End Turn button. It would have been much less of a headache on my part if I had just turned the automanage funcion on when I started playing and never delved into anything but the battle and expansion aspects of the game. 

And that is my biggest problem with the game unfortunately. After all the time I spent playing I wish I WOULD have turned automanage on. The game doesn't have a rewarding enough outcome and too many flaws with the battle system for me to have felt accomplished by the end of a campaign -- and the stupid movement points on the campaign map were fucking horseshit . . . . Often times I would cheat save right before making any kind of movements on the world map because I didn't know exactly how far I could move an army, or because the game would show me a green arrow leading all the way to a region capital I wanted to take control of and my army would move to just outside of the city. There are so many annoyances that it's easy to lose interest in the game itself I started to dread all the time that I was wasting to get everything right. It stopped being fun at a certain point and became work which is not how I wanted to feel playing a game with as awesome of a concept as this. I will say I'm not the world's biggest gamer and I will admit that I don't think I'm hardcore enought to play a game like this. I played this game as long as I did because I was committed and disciplined and had an idea in my head of what I wanted to acheive and how awesome it would feel when I did. But the fun factor definitely left me far short of my goal and I will say that it was not worth it. I'm not sorry I bought Empire for $9.99, and I can still say that I am impressed by the game after all that time I poured into it but am now without any desire to keep playing it.

I've seen the reviews of other games of the series and I want there to be a better Total War game to be developed than the one I played anyway. This is the type of game that needs more polish than it has and I would like to see what Creative Assembly could come up with if they listen to their online fan base and to also give one of these titles a much longer development time. That's what they really need is to have the little details and small flaws fixed so that the irritation factor isn't so bad. I realize just how many things the game is trying to run and juggle at the same time, and it would be absolutely incredible if they all worked, but I'd like to think that a game this big is tested before it is released for all the little annoying shit that you know is bound to happen with something with this much depth. That being said if you look at the big picture and try not to focus on so many things that piss you off, you'll find that war is Hell and it's fucking beautiful . . . . 8/10 (for the big picture)  6/10(for the experience of playing Empire)",1420320310,1420320310,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198163623932,61,2,6068,0,5846,1450757296

Playing this allows me to experience one of my favorite times in history where so much could have gone so differently with tiny decisions that no one would have thought differently about. As Prussia you have a fairly large standing army, but very few territories to back it up, and even those two aren't connected offering a real challenge to meet the victory conditions. England starts with an average number of territories but should you do well enough in the Americas you get rewarded with guess who? The 13 colonies! So they start as already superior in funds and Troops, and should they push they overwhelm everyone. Other nations such as France and Spain have oppurtunities to destroy other nations decently often, such as Spain/France teaming up on the United Provinces, if you could hold off the rebellions you have a nice moneymaking region.

82,13468464,english,"As a fan of the Total War franchise, I find Empire: Total War my personal favourite.  The naval battles really set it apart from the earlier titles.  And the tech tree is massive!  It requires you to either really focus on certain aspects or have multiple colleges for research.  The three theatres of operation (Europe, America, and India) and multiple trade zones add to the challenge of maintaining your empire.  You have many fronts to defend but so do your adversaries.  Overall it's a very solid game.

Highlights of latest campaign playing as the Netherlands:

-Crushed the French by taking Paris by turn 20.  Their overseas colonies all go rebel except one; welcome to the world stage the nation of Quebec.

-Conquered Madrid.  Gave it to one of my new best friends:  Portugal.  Spain only exists on Sardinia now.

-Conquered all of Scandinavia.  Gave it all to my other best friend: Hannover.  They are a true world power now and have been taking it to Russia ever since giving them Finland.

-After stabbing former ally England in the back found that the Irish and Scottish were happy to have my rule but England itself rebelled four times before they consented to the yoke.  They now love the Republic too.

-As a result of the conquest of England the United States rose in America.  Started a war with me over the Carolinas.  I captured the USS Consitution and it's now the flagship of my frigate fleet.  Thanks for the unique unit, America!  And the war doesn't go so good for them...

-The Maratha Confederacy foolishly declared war on me.  Used a V.O.C. army to conquer all of their holdings in India.  Kept a couple territories, gave the rest to the very friendly Mughal Empire.

  [td]In the realm of RTS games, the Total war series has always shined in its attention to unit detail. Empire follows this pattern of beautiful graphics, and wonderful combat animations. [/td]

  [td][b]Gameplay[/b][/td]
  [td][h1]6[/h1][/td]
  [td]While the combat is well thought out, the Total War series just isn't made for guns. Though, the advantage of this new turn in gameplay style does force you to think in new ways, and introduce new strategies, it doesn't quite measure up to the joy found in the other Total Wars of rushing your men headlong into battle.[/td]

  [td][h1]Overall[/h1][/td]
  [td][h1]6.4/10[/h1][/td]
  [td]While not a terrible game, Empire just isn't a good direction for the Total War series. I am relatively conflicted on recommending this one. I personally, did not enjoy this iteration of Total War, as I do not feel the game is meant for guns. However, there are several people out there that do enjoy this style of gameplay very much.

DONE.  COMPLETELY DONE.  The game killed all enjoyment in the FIRST mission.  I may come back someday, if I can brave the ugly menus and wonky game balance; but most likely, I will probably just stick with Civ5.  To be honest, I never really did ""get"" the Total War series.  It seems to me like a ""love it or hate it"" kind of thing.  My understanding of the inner nuances of the gameplay is you take your guys and you run them into the other guys.  That said, the only chance this game had would have been to wow me with some great atmosphere and immersiveness.  If you can't even spell ""Chesapeake"" right, I'm not immersed.

Anyway..2/10

72,13042126,english,"As an avid total war fan I really like this game, however it has its fair share of issues, its loaded with bugs, battle influencing bugs which are quite the pain.  The AI is absolutley atrocious, when you engage in a seige battle, for example, the enemy will at times not attack you, as you sit in your fort unable to do anything and have to wait for the battle timer to run out, and well, if you dont have any battle timer set, you better hope you saved the game before that battle so you can get lucky and win with an auto-resolve.  Thats another thing, the auto resolve, it works just fine on land, but it is completely unusable in the water.  You get a decent chance of winning the battle, however you will suffer massive casulties.  For example, if I were to win a naval battle using auto resolve, I would have lost 3 of my Ships-of-the-Line, to a fleet of merchant ships, which is completly unrealisitic.  I should probably start talking about the good stuff, first off its FUN, like really fun, like really really really fun! Especially if you are a complete history nut like myself.  For the price of 20 bucks its awesome, I never bought the expansions, never thought it was neccassary the game is just fine without them and not worth the extra 15 bucks in my opinion.  Highly reccomend, great for price, the only thing is that Napoleon Total War, the newer installment has much better graphics, and less effective muskets, which coresponds to the time period quite well. Napoleon is less broad however, focusing only on Europe, no American or Indian theatures are availible. Hope this helped, if you can get around the bugs then you will learn to LOVE this game.

The biggest point on this game is that it's time consuming. VERY time consuming. With a schedule like mine you can't get much done within one sit-down, but that keeps making me come back for more, for better or worse.

As for historic accuracy, I'm moderately educated on the time era of this game, but some events don't really add up. The AI's don't really act in accordance to actual history. For instance, Sweden likes to destroy Denmark within 15 seasons. I've also run into the problem with my closest allies suddenly declaring war on me, even though we're in ""very friendly"" relations.

Aside from those problems, this game has great complete features. The armies and naval battles play out well, and the detail is good for an older game.

I love a challenge  and prize realism and I understand how hard it is to strike a balance but there is a reason I have clocked over 100 hours and never finished a play-through.  I just cannot overlook some of the bizarre decisions the A.I makes, be it in simple trade, making peace or declaring war - it just makes no damn logical sense sometimes.  

The battle A.I is a mixed bag, most of the time fun but sometimes the tactics are just suicidal and downright stupid - I mean what genius sends his cavalry (alone) at a battle-line of 8 infantry, 4 light infantry, 4 howitzers, 2 heavy arty and two heavy cavalry....a dumbass right.

1-Three theater to play in, Europe,America and India and 4 trading regions.
2-The ability to expand on another theaters whit factions that never established overseas empires(Sweden Poland)
3-Very different way to battle than the rest of total war games. if you play whit a melee mind you will fail here.
4-Factions attitude towards you and knowing why some factions doesnt like you is my favorite part of the game.(before i used to go crazy not knowing why some factions hated me etc etc)
5-Different goverment system Republic, Contitutional Monarchy and Absolute Monarchy.(some factions may like your or hate you if they are of the same or opposed goverment type)
6-Different types of religion.Hinduism,Islam,Catholic,Protestan,Animisn and Sikhism(although i dont know why there Sikh there no main factions that has the religion,only a minor one and it appears if it rebels in punjabi region)
7-Emergent factions, this factions appear in certain regions if they rebel in their cities(example or if you eliminate the mayor faction in their main theather for example Spain. if you eliminate Spain on Europe their territories in the americas will divide into 3 factions Mexico,Gran Colombia,Pirates, or if said destroyed factions conquered some territory they will revert back to their original owners.
8-Minor factions add a whole new level of diplomacy and there are quite a few of them.Although they rarely expand.
9-The researh tree.

THE BAD
0-few factions to choose from, and they feel and have the almost the same units, except Ottoman and Maratha.They should have been more Non-european factions.
1-Game frezzes when you press ESC ALT.
2-I finished the american campiagn and havent got the American faction yet.
3-When a town is being sieged, you cant position well your troops,when they are manning the cannons,also the units tend not to shoot their enemies when below them.
4-Game crashes from time to time.
5-Diplomacy removed the following option, Attack this faction,Break alliance whit faction.
6-Agents spawn randomly not when one needs them.(in one case i had about 10 missionarys and i dint even knew where they were)
7-some regions have individual towns where they grow, intead of being regions themselfs.(example france is just one region it should have been divided up at least into 3 or 4 regions,so if you lose that region you lose a huge deal of land .
8-Campaign winning conditions should be more free. for example playing as Sweden you need some regions in russia in order to win, that means that engaging in a alliance whit said faction impossible.there whould be a FREE MODE where the winning condition is just to capture territory not from some factions.
9-Naval battles are not enjoyable.
10-Africa theather not present,Africa would have been a very fun and nice theater to play in would have some unique factions.
11-India Theather should have had more factions on it 1 or 2 more.

 I have to say that this game is good, but it feels like they had more ideas but they dint implement them i blame SEGA i think they pushed them into finishing quickly (you know production) the main reason i say this is beacuse of the Mughal Empire they are cited in the major factions window(all mayor factions are playable) but this one isnt playable.. but the  weird thing if they have their own unique units. Also some factions have unique units for example Scotland(emergent faction).",1412795299,1412795299,True,2,0,0.525179862976074219,0,True,False,False,76561198068895593,38,28,8314,0,3426,1498201379

71,10385885,english,"This game has very much going for it. Sadly, due to the enormous ammount of bugs, the game is just about unplayable. During two weeks I have had about fifty crashes after two minutes in the campaign. Also, the AI for the enemy is just stupid. They will run around in front of your troops like a chicken with it's head cut off. They will attack your cities!... only to stand there for 60 minutes staring at you. Darthmod fixes most of this but sadly, the bugs make it impossible and extremely aggravating to play. Fortunately, I was able to get the game on sale for $3.00 and so it wasn't all that big of a waste of money. It's default price of 19.99 is too much for something this broken. It is still a very good game in the few moments when it works and I still love it, but I think people should know about it's many problems before splashing out twenty bucks for it.

Edit: I did get the Campaign mode working again... up to a hundred turns that is. If you get into turn 120, 115, 130 it is almost guaranted to break in that point of the game. Now, on to muliplayer... I don't know... I've been told it's laggy and broken but... to be honest. I've lagged out of a multiplayer match within the first minute or two anyway. Fortunately, I love singleplayer so I can still have fun on that. The main problem with the AI is that it is just stupid. It is impossible to lose in this game. The ""difficulty"" (easy, medium, hard) dosent really change anything exept for the fact that four turns in everyone will go to war with you. Many things have been removed or dumbed-down to appeal to casual gamers, so in short yet another great franchise is shooting itself in the foot to appeal to casual gamers and console gamers who probably won't buy it any way. At least it's still somewhat enjoyable and playable (unlike rome 2)

Edit: again... So, I got the game up and running again and it seems to work fine. Regardless of what I said above, this is a wonderfull (if slightly buggy game) and I love it to bits.

82,12306300,english,"Put simply, this game is a bald faced lie to new buyers with interest in multiplayer.

Why do I say this?  The lack of a multiplayer campaign mode.  They say there is one, and it does exist, but, if you didn't buy the game back when, and sign up for the beta then you can't play it online.  All you get online is the mediocre tactical battles, which, yeah, can be fun, but really aren't why I would buy a total war game.

Single player?  Well, there's new units, and the map is bigger from medieval 2, so I can't say it's the same, and with all honesty, I didn't get that into it, because I wanted to play with people, which, it turns out I can't.

Basically, I bought this game on the promise of online campaigns, and, despite the fact that the thing exists, I'm excluded, because.... they arbitrarily decided to not let people do that anymore, unless they already could, in which case they still can, I guess?  

It's a bizarre and irksome decision on the developers part, and honestly, I think I'm just done with them.  Don't get me wrong. I love the idea of the game, the strategic game of production of (extremely simplified) logistics paired with a tactical simulation where the units are dependent on that strategic component.  That's just a great combo, but, honestly, it's never been done as well in any Total War game I've played as it was in Master of Orion 2 (way back in 1996!), and that's just depressing.
	
In the end, for me, the games just aren't fun enough to put up with this sort of deceptive, money grubbing dickery as they've pulled with this multiplayer lie in Empire: Total War.

Not only did it add in an extra two more sections of the world to play through simultaneously, but a research tree as well to progress your military and economic power.

The change in dynamic of combat was a little difficult to get used to at first; firing lines, directional facing and the overall slowness of the batte as well.

I would perhaps have enjoyed increased range in the earlier rifles, making them more distinct from the Line Musketmen of the era, however for balance reasons there would perhaps be no good sense in having the small units of rangers having 50% increased range or more. And indeed their increased accuracy would do no good beyond their current ranges, but if there could be a drop in accuracy for the range beyond, yet have access to that range .... it would be quite interesting I think. Still, I bought this game primarily as to a research project on mounted warfare in the era, and I look forward with hope to see an accurate portrayal of the dynamics between Dragoons, Lancers, and Curiassiers.

Ultimately I believe that if you take all GUI and User Interface from this game, and replace the units with those of the previous era, you would see a MUCH IMPROVED ""Medieval 3: Total War""

80,9556661,english,"UPDATED REVIEW: After playing this game further, I have better reason and judgment as to why one should not purchase Empire: Total War.

Let me begin by stating that I love Medieval II: Total War. It is by far one of my favorite games of all time. I purchased Empire thinking that it would be a logical upgrade from Medieval II. I was immediately disappointed by the extremely long loading times, both when booting up the game and launching or loading a campaign. I intially thought this was due to my laptop's admittedly-low-quality specs, but was reassured that this was a problem within the game itself when it persisted on my desktop, which can run Battlefield 3 on the highest settings and maintain a steady 60 fps. I was then further angered by the unreasonably low amount of playable factions, especially in comparison to the large amount of unplayable factions. 

When in a campaign, unlike Medieval II, one must govern the farm, port, town, and city of a region. For example, the city and region may be Magdeburg, which may also have a small town, farm, and port. All of which have individual troops and buildings to manage. This becomes incredibly intricate and annoying to manage as your empire grows to encompass much of Europe, India, and the Americas. The troops and buildings cost an incredible amount of money to purchase and maintain, and the amount of money you can earn is low in comparison. Like Civilization, one must research technologies to progress through the game correctly. These take a tedious amount of time. If you slack or forget at any point in your campaign to research a new technology, you will almost immediately be left in the dust by your AI enemies. Speaking of AI, the AI factions of Empire have no sense of diplomacy whatsoever, especially when compared to the nonplayable factions of Medieval II. They'll go to war with you simply because you share a border, and will end a truce or alliance a turn after it is made. Total annihilation is the only fate for any faction in this game. 

Graphically, the campaign map is awful. It ditches the semi-satellite-image style of Medieval II, and tries to portray a tapestry or painting globe. This style fails, and ruins any seriousness that the game's campaign has. Also, the in-game text is terribly small! I have 20-20 vision, and can barely read the in-game tips, notifications, and other text. The battles, however, are very nice compared to Medieval II. The particle and weather effects are upgraded heavily, and soldier models have a lot more fidelity. Battlegrounds and scenes are a lot more varied and detailed. 

The mechanics for battles are essentially the same as Medieval II, but Empire is the first in the series to introduce naval battles. Do not expect an Assassin's Creed IV experience. These naval battles are incredibly difficult and clunky. It's a lot of fun to witness AI battles, but to actually commandeer a fleet is too daunting and annoying to enjoy.

All in all, if you're looking for a first taste of the Total War series, or want to relieve what the series was like in its earlier days, do not purchase this game. It ditches the realism of Napoleon and simplicity of Medieval II, and falls flat on delivering any sort of strategic or fun experience. 

Seriously, just play Medieval II.


OLD REVIEW: 

As are most Total War games, this is a must-have for RTS and simulation fans. However, if you are a fan of Medieval II as I am, you'll find this game takes a bit getting used to, and is not as good as M2. For starters, the map and map style are not as realistic, ditching the photorealism for a revolutionary-era styled artsy map. This heavily effects the quality of the game, as you feel like you're playing a Total War variation of Civilization Revolution. Also, just like civilization, Empire introduces technology research, which incredibly slows the pace by which you play. Because of this, the play style in the campaign is almost nowhere near how you would play Medieval II or games prior. But, these are nearly counter-balanced by the shear map size and number of playable factions. All of Europe and North America are conquerable, as well as India and some parts of Africa and South America. Coastland Asia, Oceania, and other parts of Africa and merely used as trade posts. 

One element that ruins this, however, is how irrational and warmongering the NPC factions are. Almost all of your neighbors will end up going to war with you, no matter how much you try diplomacy, appeasing, or just plain being an isolationist. Just like Civilization, a country will swoop in and take your provinces without any warning, and the game's economic system will force you to spend a terrible amount of turns preparing armies before you can actually defend yourself. 

Basically, this is Total War: Civilization. If that suits you, go ahead and buy it. I'll stick with Medieval II.",1395196859,1408141009,False,35,0,0.53195720911026001,1,True,False,False,76561198065679366,62,18,1074,0,978,1597280391

For a fun campaign, I highly recommend America with the Elite Units packs. Great Britain is also very fun in the Grand Campaign. For the most challenging campaign, I recommend the Ottoman Empire (since there are multiple factors working against you).

Improves: ETW had a coop multiplayer in beta mode, but it fell short when they did not stick with allowing players to battle against the computer (every battle was pvp); this was the biggest downside overall. Also, sometimes the CPU will make extremely stupid tactical and strategic decisions during the game (i.e. a very weak country will declare war on your powerful one, or have their general literally walk up to your front line during a battle to get shot to pieces).

I like the tech progression over previous total war games, which possess an obscure population/building related advancement. Which i found midlly annoying and tedious. Agents, i found, are more useful in this game as well; although, they spawn randomly and cannot be recruited. Cannon and gunfire can be satisfying, and you can definitely tell the difference between highly skileld and non-skilled combatants.

The combat is engaging and immersive. You have two forms as well, naval and land. As you develop more technologies and research more manuvers, the game only gets better.

In the campaign, you may build numerous buildings such gardens, barracks, markets, fur traders, brothels, etc. You can also build units, and lead them into battle. The battle system in campaign has 3 options. Siege, Assault, and Auto-Resolve (along with retreating). When sieging a city, it will ""starve"" a city to where you can take the city over without fighting after a number of turns, depending on it's defenses. The enemy can fend off a siege, though. The assault option takes a more advanced turn on battles, to where you may command your units to fight the enemy units, and manage the battle manually. The auto-resolve option is just what it says, it automatically decides who the winner of the battle will be depending on numbers, technology, and skills of both of the empires. This option is what I usually choose, unless the odds do not look in my favor or the skills look even. In campaign, diplomatic relations also take place. Depending on which nation you are, you may start out with some allies depending on the history of your nation (EX: Spain is with Britain, Great Britain is with United Provinces). Other nations become wary of being your allies if you go to war with your own allies, or break treaties. The longer you have someone as your friend, the harsher the trust falls with other nations. Economy also exists within Empire, and gaining money can be fairly challenging. You may become trading partners with other nations (the best route, just don't declare war on everyone!), you may tax your people highly (not recommended, as the people will revolt to make new nations), and you can always take over other regions (though you will have to exempt them from tax for a few turns to lower the chances of rebellions and strikes).

In the Road to Independence, you are the Thirteen Colonies. You first start by fighting Native Americans, you settle. The campaign then focuses on settling the lands, and defending them from Native Americans. Later on, you have to capture regions from the French in the French and Indian War. This then leads to pushing the actual British out of the lands, claiming Independence. A fairly fun campaign.

In Battles mode, this focuses on battles and battles only (aka ""Assaulting"" a city in campaign). You can either customize your own battles, or choose from the historical ones already laid out for you.

Multiplayer for this game features Battles mode, and no campaign. It is fairly fun, but be sure to warm up in campaign first before trying to conquer your friends!

Unfortunately though, like a failing colonial empire, the game is just too ambitious - the world map is on the one hand too big for the AI to cope with (the fact that no one ever bothers with India particularly irritates me) and on the other, too small to be a proper representation of the era, the diplomatic options (and non-military options in general) are not fleshed out enough to do 18th century Europe justice, and the game in general just feels like its too shallow and thinly-spread.

70,10962835,english,"Now, the Total War series has to be one of my absolute favorites. Empire: Total War continues that awesomeness. One of my favorite features of these games, especially this one, is the way you can drastically change history. As Prussia, I have claimed Austria and Bavaria, kicked the Italians out of Venice, Italy, and turned the entire European world against Sweden. Now, these are the things I have done. What I do then effects what other nations do as well. Spain destroyed Portugal, Great Britain is now killing off the Indians before the colonists have even gotten the chance to have a revolution. The French and Indian war? That has come 40 years ahead of its time as trade with my spectacular Prussia has boosted the British economy to crush the French. This isn't just some turn-based game either, it CAN be just that if you'd prefer, but if you want more from your ordinary turn-based game, Empire: Total War sends you into the musket fire. Let me be honest when I say the only dissapointing feature of this game are the sieges. They show the buildings the enemy or as well as yourself have built, a barracks, or the government buildings, but thats pretty much it. Maybe 1-5 buildings inside fortified walls. The older Rome Total War's would give you many houses and organized streets unlike the newer Empire: Total War. Don't get me wrong though, it is still very fun to charge your infantry into the broken walls of an enemy fortress. If you want to succeed at this game, whether its simply to control 20 other regions or to dominate the world, just learn from past mistakes in history.

Another feature this game has is not only the ability to hire a number of different units, but build fortresses and defend in buildings.

Anyways, back to the game. Empire is quite different from the other games in the series because it allows Naval Battles! On this unique experience, you control your army on the 7 seas, versing A.I. or real people online or locally. It can get quite intense, as your ships may flee if damaged, but there are also contreversol wins!

The game also allows you to (as I mentioned earlier) to play online with friends, or random people. The problem with online matches though, is that if your internet is bad, you must drop from the game. This can lead to frustraion from the opposing player. You can also do quick Naval or Land matches (Although, finding a game in the quick section is difficult.) You can team up and join an alliance in online matches too! They are quite intense! I prefer playing with friends, 'cause im so good at the game and I beat them :3.

The Total War Series has never been known for graphics, but I have to say this game suprises me. My favourite part is seeing my men run into my enemy and watch the battle. You can see them have little battles with eachother! It looks quite realistic, as after the batttle you can see all the dead men that have fought.

Overall this game is meant for RTS players who enjoy a good online battle. This game is simple to manuver and comprehend. This is my favourite out of the Total War series (personally.) Overall, It definately fed my hunger for a good bloodbath and RTS game.

29,10545480,english,"This game is completely worth every penny in the price! This is a RTS fans dream come true!

Let me hit the highlights of this game:

The graphics and sound effects make it feel as if your actually in an 18th century army. When I get off the game, I sometimes feel as if Im getting out of a time machine, bringing myself back from the past, back to the present.

Building and researching takes a little figuring out and can be confusing, but you'll see things as you play. Completing the tutorial will also help.

On the Grand Campaign, it is CRITICAL you begin recruiting, and researching military stuff immediately. The easier the setting, the lesser the AI will attack you, but they'll come. My favorite faction is Prussia. However, when you first begin the Grand Campaign, there is a ton of factions. Even factions you cant choose from. Usually, around the fourth turn, Prussia and Austria declare war on each other, because they are close to each other and hostile towards the other. So, whichever faction you choose to be, be warned: the factions that are your neighbors are most likely to declare war against you.

Once you enter battle, your given time to setup your troops. If your using cannons, it is VITALE you set them up before the battle begins. They setup into firing position slow and can be moved slow. Very realistic, so it takes away any annoying feeling.

You will need to build navies. Those can be extra challenging. The cost of a single ship is extra high, so building a huge navy is slow. Its also pretty hard to have multiple huge navies at the same time. Although most helpful, usually its best to build a navy when your ready for use.

Naval battles are probably the most difficultest battle. The ships sail slowly. The AI usually starts in a single line, and spreads out, slowly, encircling your ships. These battles vary in time length, usually depending on who has the more battle ships. A variety of ships helps.

In the Grand Campaign, they also have notes mentioning historical events, such as Captain Kidd being hung, the start of circus's and much, much, much more.

When I tried an online multi player battle, I was in RTS gamers heaven. No matter the AI, playing against an opponent who thinks, is 100 times better. Especially when you win.

What do I mean by this? Well. The music is terrible, the collisions between units are embarassing, the micro-management of cities and your overall empire is overly complciated and tedious ( They should've gone for a Civ V style of city management. ) , there is no tutorial for new players such as myself in regards to the campaigns and any situation that isn't a battle. I'm really quite ashamed that I wasted £15.00 on this game as it totally soured my overall liking for the Total War franchise. Perhaps next time, the devs should make the game a bit more easier for newer players to integrate and learn other than simply putting a tiny text box in the corner of the screen. I suppose that yes, I could spend a bit longer learning it and mastering the details... However, If a game cannot provide the simple feature of a tutorial that actually I don't know... HELPS the player to learn the ropes then I don't see it as a game worth learning. I'll be uninstalling after this review has been sent.

49,10489157,english,"Took a long time but this game finally hooked me.  Here are the pros and cons:

Pros:
- Voice acting is EXQUISITE.  

If you are multilingual, try playing one of the countries where you know their language.  The Tutons speak German, the Indians speak (what?  Hindi?), the Britians speak English with a British accent, and the Americans speak with an American accent.

- The tactical battles are very good.

This might also depend on what AI difficulty you choose - but at a normal difficulty tactical battles are interesting.  They might even be considered the core gameplay of the game, and avoiding them with autoresolve means far worse outcomes than playing them yourself.

- The quotes during loads are interesting reading

- The way the world is divided adds a new mechanic (instead of having one contiguous map)

This adds some confusion, but after understanding it the mechanic adds an extra dimension to the gameplay.

- Economic system is good


Cons:

- By now most TBS games have a consistent UI at least where outstanding tasks are concerned, but not Total War

If you forgot to move that unit who's been sitting idle for the last 3 turns - it's your fault.  You should have gone and looked at a book or something.  Or you should play Warlock or Civ or Fallen Enchantress or Endless Space because ALL of those games handle this exactly the same way with a list in the right column.

- Don't let the campaign turn you off.

It's not a great campaign, but at least there is one.  The downside is the campaign hides some of the goodness the game has to offer, and there are confusing moments at the very beginning where the tactical battle makes no sense.  [Not a good time to confuse players.  Devs, I recommend ""never"" as the best time to confuse players.]

- Sea battles are just too realistic (which translates into boring)

I know I know... ""It's realistic!  We went to some naval museum or whatnot and got accurate reproductions of these ships and the physics blah blah blah...""  We don't care.  Well I don't anyways.  Can't you put in a realism slider?  I'm used to ship handling like in Pirates!  And this is WAAAAY too slow even accelerated.

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Also, you can't really tell which of the various countries might resonate with you, so don't get turned off by the first country you try to play.  I played Britian for a while, and then on a whim switched to playing India and loved it.  The best way is to experiment.

In all it's a satisfying game.

The graphics are an improvement, though they aren't great, but in this kind of game, I prefer gameplay over visuals. The gameplay is great - the world is gigantic, there is a new building system that makes building multiple structures simultaneously possible, there is a technology and philosophy research area, there are gentleman, naval battles where you can actually control your ships (I don't enjoy these much, though they look nice), there is North America and some of South America, and India (which we only got a glimpse of in Alexander!) There are many playable factions, and you can even unlock the American Indian factions by purchasing the Warpath DLC (this, again, requires a drastic change in strategy from the main ETW game, so buyer beware; it's probably also the only DLC worth buying, and only for a few bucks). Oh, and there's also the good ole US of A, which can be played in a campaign tracing the nation's development from a few settlers in Jamestown to an independent but vulnerable republic at the turn of the century. 
A few cons: the game is a bit glitchy, battles usually take place in boring forts that all look the same instead of cities, cannon have limitless ammo (could be a pro), game can get slow with the sheer number of factions at the end of every turn.

Then i bought the game. It was amazing. Commanding my first empire was a blast, conquering Indian Tribes, and sailing to the Americas, discovering new lands. The AI wasn't the best, so I took a break and downloaded Darth Mod.

Then, I jumped back straight onto the game with Darthmod UC. Then I started my 2nd Empire. I realized how better it was, and much more challenging. I kept Darthmod, because it improved graphics, and AI. Then I got used to the game. I decided to begin a bigger Empire with much more enemies. I started focusing on Economy and it really helped. I got trade and towns up. I got so much money, that I made a huge army. I felt so good.

Thats when the colonies decided to declare independance. I got pretty mad, so I discovered I could have relations. Know I knew alot of the game. I was ready.

I sailed with my allies to the new Americas. There, the war with the Rebels lasted 3 Years in-game. I had a blast battling. I gave some land to my allies in the Americas to avoid rebels. I took the Americas back for myself then. After I had conquered most of the Americas, I decided to move into uncharted land and waters. I found tribes, and made allies, and made new enemies. I was amazed by the game. I conquered many new lands, and made many enemies.

My empire became power hungry, and I fell apart. I was so happy, and I enjoyed myself. Just next time, hope to lead a more successful empire.

The campaign features the entire world (excluding the Northern and Southern Ice caps) as oppose to Medieval II which only featured Europe. 
This game in the Total War series also featured not only land based conflict, but also sea based conflict of which the player has the ability to command and control.

Ultimately I found this game extremely enjoyable and would recommend this game to anyone, particularly those whom enjoy games within the strategy genre, but even those who don't may even be persuaded to do so by this brilliant game!",1401562190,1401562366,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198053421442,29,1,1381,0,948,1479557004

Its the complete opposite. Allies won't help at all, city states that are allied to you at the start of the game drag you into wars with super powers you can't possibly win and if you break the alliance you lose ALL your allies, and everyone will hate you and go to war with you. Another thing, navies. Navies are very key to the game (as you can imagine) but sadly its very very hard to build one. You start off with no navy to speak of, while other countries (Spain, France) have many fleets. You can try to build a navy, but before its big enough another nation will come along and destroy it. Finally my last issue is up keep of armies. The game is called Total War for a good reason, you are always at war on multiple fronts (which is annoying as you have to put all your money into war and you can't improve your nation). Which means you will need multiple armies, which is hard at the start because your allies wont help and you will get bankrupt, your troops will leave you and you will get overrun. I have played this game alot (I got the game on a disk before I got it on steam hence the measly two hours on record) and have won world domination on hard difficulty. This game is playable but it will be one miserable ride.
However this some moments can be quite good, like when thousands of your cavalry charge down those damn rebels. And when you look over whole continents that belong to you. And when you finally crush filthy France and Spain for constantly hindering your progress. There are good moments and the tears, pain and self harm make it worth it. So maybe you should give it a go.

Unfortunately, Creative Assemblies has yet to optimize the multiplayer experience. So a lot of games may drop, lag, have cheaters who don't follow rules, and just downright noobs who don't know what the'yre doing and there's not much player-side control over it. 

However, with its flaws, I still find the multiplayer to be much more balanced and enjoyable than Napoleon Total War. Granted I play native americans most of the time, I find that the factions have many different strengths & weaknesses, and the diversity of playing style and tactics are endless. It's also really fun to piss arrogant people off by beating them with mere Axes and Arrows. 

I also find the strategy to be much more in-depth than Napoleon. NTW just relies on stretching out lines, artillery barrages, and cavalry charges. In empire you have to be much more selective with how you form and move your infantry on the battlefield and which units to assign to different tasks. 

Are the expansions worth it? If you want to play online, definitely as it will keep you in equal balance with other players, although you can still win without them. For single player, not really, as downloading expansions like darthmod will give you tons of interesting added-on units.

this game seems to be trying to merge civilisation game play with a RTS, thats great and all and does it well to some degree,
but there are some serious issues with this game. 

Cons:
-Tutorial sucks, this game has a steep learning curve and does little to help with the game mechanics. 
-Repetetive skirmishes, the combat gets stale and repetetive quickly.
-AI is bad, the AI rarely behaves exactly as you would like.
-Like civ the turns hang on the AI turns for some time making the game take much longer and can and will become frustrating fast.
-Text is bad, it uses bitmap text rather then dynamic vector based fonts, meaning nearly all resolutions you will have a hard 
time reading anything without adding a text mod. 
-No workshop support, this game could really benefit from having it. 
-Its buggy, especially on lower end machines.
-Controls are counter intuitive, they made moving the camera and ordering units a bit more complicated then they needed to. 

Pros
-Realistic combat, your soldiers in each block are their own person they behave differently to those around them.
-The game is somewhat historically accurate, they also give you some interesting facts about things as you play.
-Naval combat (this is a large part of why i bought the game).
-units move realistically when they move over different terrain, or scale a wall it looks real, also on the naval ships you see all the tiny people realistically operate the ship!
-combat seems realistic, and terrain plays a big part, your army benefits greatly or suffers greatly from the sections of terrain they are placed on.

Best strategy game ever
Highly recommend 
I have been an RTS fan since early on, played all the great names from Command & Conquer to Wh40k: Dawn of War. Of all these games, Empire:TW brought the biggest satisfaction. The game might be getting old now, but it`s glory doesn't fade. Even if you never played Total War games before, this is a must buy for any RTS fan.
Starting from the graphics. Like said, some time passed since it`s release, but never the less, when put on max. settings it is still beautiful. The sound is done quite well. I enjoy every round of shots made from the infantery, the roar of canons, the thousands of feet marching to the beat of the drum, the hissing of primitive missiles in the air.....
The game itself gives you a lot of feautres. The two singleplayer modes let you play as some of the greatest nations of the time, from Prussia to the Maratha Confederacy (the other SP mode let`s you play as the United States on their way to independence). Your job is to form alliances, make trade, conquer areas, defeat your enemies, develop your nation, and if you feel like it, you can always coup the monarchy and establish a republic. The campaign itself is turn based, moving your armies and agents in a pre-set range of movement each season, governing your cities and doing some diplomacy along the way. The battles on the other hand are real-time, but you can change the speed of battle from slow-motion all the way to fast. The map on which you play on is determined by the region you are fighting in. Battles can be either the classical land battles, sieges or naval battles. If you don't feel like doing a battle, but you have good chances, simply click autoresolve (save the battle just in case you get defeated). The multiplayer is also quite good, letting several players play as their favourite nation and setting up their army.

You can perform Bayonet charges you can make forts, actually who am I kidding you can do sooo much in it! And they're are a few problems with it that some people I have seen noticed. The bots never seem to attack the forts even on the hardest difficulty, they'll get near them, wait one turn then move to a city. Now this gets boring cause I put a fort to fight them and prevent them to come in my cities, not to scare them away and wait till its deserted, THEN attack. And a lot of this seems a tad bit unfair, you gift them something they should be able to gift back, say I give them 5000 gold early in game and later I ask for a peice of technology say carbines, they should say yes (Since their opinion about us is very friendly).

Troops range from militia to the elite british cold stream guards or provencial cavalry (militia cavalry pretty much) to the polish winged hussars and even demi cannons (stationary, low firepower artillery) to mortars, howizters, normal cannons, to low firepower but mobile horse artillery.

__________________________

A game set in ol' 1700's. The Developers made a good pavement to reach for this, but it has bumps.

To be honest the game is really slow to load especially when you buy it, but after time it gets better; in fact it loads in like 2-3 minutes after that. I made a battle in *Road to Independance* , Took one hell of a long time to load -.- so I just had to restart my computer, I know when the numbers are big you have to wait but come on! I lost my patience after 15 minutes. Another flaw is that when I was using my Riflemen to put Stakes in front of my Puckle Guns... Oh! -.- This I hate very much and stupid *Glitch* They turned around took a couple of paces and planted them... facing my dragoons! And away from the Indian cavalry, long story-short I got F***ed ... SO that really sucked xD 


 Good side is that they have good detail ( Troops, Forts, Seperate Nations, Cannons, and Cavalry, how the Country's are geographically accurate *Mapping* and also Accents =D ) . Sea Battles are cool, got incredible detail, Hilarius when you see the enemy ship blow up xD not so much when it's a Heavy First Rate xD .

__________________________
Nice Achievments but sometimes in the Main Campaign they are kinda *twisted*. I mean World Domination is conquering 40 citites? ( Hardest Right?) Short-Long Campaign- Capture 15-25 Cities... Now xD don't tell me this...

When in World Domination Prussia needs Brandenburg ( Its own Capital so no prob right? =D ) 

England Short-Long, well capture Malta ( My own Country =D Some place in India, Merika, have to go to War with em' Ottomans; so Total War right?)
I don't know :P

__________________________
Small flaws when it comes to Diplomacy and I'm not alone -.- Ok so ex. I tell France that I want one of their technology in exchange for 3 of mine, They say no... REALLY? no???!!!ok so what am I to do?- Nothing. After some time when you are at war, they offer peace after no war acts happen (Battles) or either just don't quit on the war.. heh :P . In Medieval Total War they have that - Balanced, Generous or Demanding - Note to help set things *equal* when you are at Diplomacy. They could've made that would really help a lot =D

WHAT I DID LIKE:

I really enjoy this game, there's nothing more exhiliarating than 17th and 18th century combat where people would stand in ranks and shoot at the enemy (people who have the balls to do that are respected by me). 

There are many ways to go at your opponent in terms of strategy and many units are available from many nations to further increase your customization.

Managing your empire, which includes: putting down rebellions, trading with other nations, researching war technologies, assassinating an enemy's agent, or even bribing others to get what you want, is a vast and immersive part of the game I really do like.

WHAT I DIDN'T LIKE:

There are a few framerate issues if you stay in a battle for too long, if you put too many men close together, or if you create too much artillery debris. This isn't a problem with my system, as it was made with modern and top notch parts, but it seems the game can't handle these sorts of things.

Naval combat is wonky. It's not too fun and I usually skip it if I can.

Sometimes it can be very can to negotiate with nations for trade access if they keep counteroffering with a demand of money and a few of your technologies.

The AI can be pretty retarded and there are a lot of bugs, most of them though have been fixed with patches. The DLC are not great but they aren't garbage even though you get little content for the price.The negotiation system is pretty bad, and the relations between nations is a mixed bag. I liked how the buildings works and trade is awesome. The generals though were pretty bad and gimmicky since you could win an otherwise unwinnable battle just by recruiting a bunch of them on the spot.

The only real problem i have is the frame rate on the campaign map but i have a rubbish computer so maybe that's just me. The battles in my opinion are stunning, yes, they take less skill to win but that's not really CA's fault. This time in history was generally, stand in front of each other and shoot. Well, there's more to it than that but you get where I'm coming from. But yeah, battles are amazing, the naval battles are ok. They look great but it's a little annoying having to control each indiviudal ship for them to do any real good. I read someone else's review and they said the campaign map is simplified, well i don't agree with that at all. The campaign map has a much larger part in this game. Trade routes and roads can be raided, there's trading zones all over the world, there's many different parts to the map rather than just cities. It's generally a larger part of the game. Which i rather like. 

So to summerize (this has been quite lengthy i apologize) the game is really good, i seriouslly recommend getting it. Like i said, i have had no problems that made me want to stop playing the game. It's even more stunning especially with the naval battles. The land battles are a little simpler but that comes with the time period really.

The AI did have some good sides though, they were pretty aggresive and never came in small numbers, constant raids on farms and towns make beating them a struggle(the good kind). I just wish in real time they played smarter. For example: sieges tended to occur often with the computer. On almost every occasion, I was out-numbered 5:1 and the ai would ""walk"" his army to the gates and stop while only a few regiments attack. It could easly over-run me but it sends them in one at a time while the rest of the army take cannon and musket fire. By the time the timer runs out, the ai loses 1000 men on average over my 100. Open field combat tends to be better, but sieges are just to easy. Don't get me wrong, i love the game its just small things that get to me. Over all, I'd give it a 7/10.

in the game each region has villages or towns that will grow over time and these can be turned into reaserch, religion or industrial towns that can help you reaserch multiple technologies (my favorite), spread your religion or gain more money.

naval and land battles are fun, cannons play less of a role in land battles than in FOTS since you need to reserch different cannon balls for your guns to get explosive or incindiary. And if you want a new army but don't have a general you can just recruit one on the spot. The ability to build forts can help defend a narrow area that might lead straight to your defensless city.

the interface is difficult to get used to if you have played shogun 2 most of the time since text is small, borders are not very clear and the white triangle on the mini-map is hard to see through. I would reccomend getting a text enlarger for the game.

In terms of mods ETW doesn't have steam workshop but i haven't looked around for mods either. Napoleon total war has a WW1 mod for it but is much smaller with only Europe in the game and suffers from some of the problems above.

  First of all, Empire Total War is the first Total War title to feature naval battles (which I suck at). But the community had been asking for this for ages. So, I'm glad it finally came to be.

  Gameplay wise. The battles are fun weather it be a massive battle for control of a nations capitol or a small skirmish to harass an enemy force. The campaign map is massive in size and would take ages to fully conquer (Most I ever got was 75% or so). Two things I dislike about this game is the A.I pathing and the A.I. politics. When it comes to pathing its okay and I get it can be hard to do with units made up of a hundred men but when of these men get stuck trying to walk through a cart its brutal. For some reason when one guy gets stuck the whole unit looses the ability to move, shoot, or follow orders properly. Then the politics.

Empire:Total War by The Creative Assembly is a Real-Time Strategy Game requiring intellect and strategy to master, based around the period of the 18th Century and the American Revolution, You have a wide array of troops and machines of different origins and skills depending on the faction you choose, Your objective is to take control of one of the major factions, Great Britain, France, Spain, Russia, United Provinces, Sweden, Prussia, Poland-Lithuania, Ottoman Empire, Austria and even the Maratha Confederacy to conquer lands such as North America, Europe, And Asia all while researching new technology, managing agents, garrisons, and forging alliances and trade agreements to compete with your foes.

All in all this is perhaps the most interesting of the Total War titles in my opinion, and i would definitely recommend it.

This game by itself is fun but the most fun comes from mods, but there is one that is essential: http://www.moddb.com/mods/darthmod-empire
This is a game changing mod that opens up a wide and new expanise world to play in with larger amounts of troops, better graphics, new and improved sounds, gameplay and the ability to play as almost any faction that is not available in the normal game. This lets you play as minor nations like the knights of st. john and other minor factons, because of this ability to play as lesser factions opens up a new level of freedom the orignal game doesn't offer. The new A.I makes the game harder to play due to it being stronger and you the choice to start off weaker. 

This game is getting old compared to the new total war games but this is your game. with over +300 hours on it i still enjoy it, for only $20 i think it is worth picking up this game if you are looking for a good strategy war game set in the 18th century.

46,8720946,english,"£20.00? I didnt know they stacked shit that high. All kidding aside though, empire total war is a great departure from the hack-n'-slash swords and sandals action of all previous installments, with a new (hindering) engine (that would draw the series back for its next installments) and guns all over the place. the mechanics work well, but its buggy, has a very poorly designed and unoptimised UI (with unit cards being tiny in MP, and the campaign UI being so shrunken and off mods are a MUST) overall, its a choppy attempt at colonial warfare. Is it fun? Hells yea, but Im a die hard total war fan- and the UI is genuinley unbearable. To the point where I will stop playing halfway through a turn. For a first installment in the 'new' total war franchise, its not a ragged abortion like Rome 2, but not a work of strategic art, like most of the first series, especially Medieval 2 and Rome TW. Also, naval warfare... personally I think they did it as best they could, but its complicated, hard to master and REALLY annoying at times. Its nice due to demand after the other games, but leaving it out would have saved shogun 2 and Rome 2's naval battles some credibility. AI is worse than the other games in my opinion, only trumped in Rome 2 for its flaws- and that is saying something. Overall, its a shoddy mess of a creative assembley idea- but it gave way to Napoleon and Shogun 2, the latter of which is top 3 in the series. So if you want an opener into the new engine before exploring the vastly superior titles later on down the line- empire is your jam. But if guns aren't your thing, then the butter is in Shogun 2 , Medieval 2 and Rome TW. 
Oh, and dont give the modern neo-capitalist devs the bread which is DLC, because if the run button becomes dowloadable content in the next one then you might as well have this game to play instead :)

47,8712966,english,"This game is far from perfect.

The worst thing is that you cannot save during battles, or during the opponents' turn. If various computer opponents attack you ten times between your turns, you never get to save, and unless you auto-resolve the battles, each battle may run 1-2 hours and you might have 10-20 hours of fighting before you can next save the game. For me, the game was very stable, but leaving it dominating my gaming computer for a week or more without being able to save did not feel good. Once you start to dominate, you rarely have to fear attack, and this type of long, drawn-out slug fest turn disappears, but until then, expect to leave the game running all the time... And you never get to save in mid-battle.

Saved games are huge on your HDD. Big enough that I stopped keeping my saves from the beginning and end of each turn, but started to recycle a group of 10 saves instead. Beginning and end of turn, and beginning and end of every battle. In a hundred turn game, they add up unless you recycle.

Ships. Nice to see ships, but the battle system felt really contrived. For example, the sailing ship fights give small ships a longer range than larger ships. That's the opposite of reality. Secondly, ships can only run away once per turn - again, that doesn't reflect reality, where small ships could run away from the big battlewagons each and every time they saw them, and only had to fear frigates. Then there's the whole: spin your ship like a top strategy. It just didn't work with big ships in reality. But it works in Empire. Spin one direction, fire. Spin the other direction, fire. And yet...it's fun to watch your ships batter the other side's ships to pieces.

Seiges. Are handled terribly. The computer just doesn't know how to attack a fort very well, or defend a fort very well. If you wait a couple of turns, a more sensibly managed battle takes place just outside the fort, but tying up your army for two turns anywhere is frustrating.

Setup. Even outside forts, the computer can give itself some utterly terrible opening setups - most terribly when it entrenches its artillery.

Armies. Armies start out tiny. Not simply poorly armed and trained: tiny and poorly armed and trained. Why?

Stacks. Are limited to 20 units. Battles are limited to 20 units PER COUNTRY. So if you have three stacks of twenty units, you only get to deploy 20 units at a time. Toughest and most satisfying battle I fought was against a stack of 20 French units, reinforced by 20 Spanish units and several French units. None of my units routed, despite fighting against 40 enemy units at once, and having one opponent's units (the French) getting reinforced by a fresh unit whenever a unit of theirs routed. Oh, normal difficulty - you're the best!

Government leaders. Are random and can have HUGE effects on your ability to wage war. It'd be nice to be able to disable that wildcard, 'cause mostly I enjoy the battles. And for that matter: it'd be nice to have a summary of the effects of all your government leaders.

All that bad, and still...watching my little men kill the little enemy men is fun. And so is taking over the world. I don't know why. About 100 hours at the keyboard for a grand campaign?

56,8671100,english,"Empire: Total War was an extremely enjoyable game to play.  Single player was impressive, featuring both land and sea battles.  The turn-based campaign system continued the evolution of the proven Total War style and the addition of multiple regions - I.E. North America and India - greatly expanded the game's realm of regions and nations.  Despite the limited number of maps, the multiplayer was always entertaining in one way or another against other players of varying skills.  Entertaining, that is, as long as your opponent did not resort to that annoying light infantry ""meat shield"" nonsense. 
Empire: Total War, however, suffered from several major drawbacks that were addressed and amended in Napoleon: Total War but were never retroactively applied to Empire.  In 2010, Empire was essentially abandoned by the developers at Creative Assembly who seemed to put their undivided attention onto the release and expansion of Napoleon: Total War.  The rush to leave behind fellows such as the Duke of Marlborough, Frederick II and William Howe in favor of Wellington and Bonaparte seemed very obvious (such as there only being four historical battles to play in ETW). This should not be too much of a surprise, however, since CA is a UK based company and the Brits have this unexplainable fixation with the Napoleonic era opposed to any of the other major conflicts of the Georgian time period.
That said, Empire: Total War did showcase many signs that there was at least some contribution from real historical advisors behind the scenes.  There were accurate descriptions and background information for each unit that could be recruited and there were countless facts, achievements and progress milestones of the 18th century as a whole featured in the turn based campaign mode.  On the other hand, CA seemed to have left their software artists and developers to create visual material based on their own erroneous assumptions on things such as troop uniforms and accoutrements.  The naval gameplay was praised as being a first for the Total War games, but it basically was mirrored directly off of the naval gameplay in Edios's awful ""Imperial Glory"" that was released back in 2004.  Empire's version was graphically superior with a Total War touch, but the naval gameplay system was pretty much identical to that in ""Imperial Glory"", right down to the broadside control panel.  Naval power was far too balanced among nations, so it was extremely frustrating to encounter pirate fleets with horrendously overpowered galleons and nations such as the Maratha Confederacy with multi-deck ships of the line.  The naval engagements were still fun, a sight to behold when many ships were engaged in battle and were always the most challenging aspect of the game.
However, I purchased Empire: Total War the month it was released in 2009 for the land battles.  Eighteenth century armies were expensive to raise, train, supply and equip.  Campaigns were therefore usually more like a game of chess rather than a war of total destruction; the object was to maneuver here, besiege a city or a fort there and drive your opponent from the field when the battle was joined.  Total War's gameplay, however, dictated pure body counts and defeating your enemy in detail.  Smoothbore musket accuracy was therefore exaggerated, even though the muskets of the day could not accurately hit anything beyond 50 yards.  Unfortunately, the AI controlled units in ETW were all pretty much created upon the old software framework dating back as far back as Medieval: Total War.  The AI therefore had a preponderance at times for all-out melee fights and had a knack for always deploying in deep formations even though only the first 3 ranks could fire. 
That said, the game's ""three rank fire"" system was clunky (an entire formation of line infantry would wait for one guy to reload) and seemed to have been copied from a scene from the film ""Zulu"" and not from any military history research.  Historically, all three ranks in tight formation in the 18th century would usually fire a single volley together, either as one entire regiment/battalion/brigade, or by alternating sections along the line on the platoon/company/regiment level depending on the size of the formation.  Another 3-rank method was where the front rank only would fire and then retire to the rear so the next rank could then step up and fire after they passed.  Curiously, this had been accurately portrayed way back in Shogun: Total War with the arquebus units, but was not available in Empire.  Having to spend several turns researching things such as rank fire and the ""fire and advance"" maneuver when they were already standard in Europe by 1700 was very annoying. 
Many of the finer details, such as uniform designs, were obviously created by the studio artists who had a limited knowledge of the time period.  Units lacked uniformity in their musket designs and in their ""uniforms"", which, no matter what year you were in during the game, all looked like costume interpretations of was worn in the 1760's.  While muskets units had a limited range, they seemed as effective at 5 yards as they were at 100.  There was no design variation from regiment to regiment, soldiers’ heights, etc.  Artillery units all had the same range capability (shrapnel shot was not widely available until well into the 19th century) and massive 24 pounder siege weapons were turned into standard issue guns at a time when 3-pounder and 6-pounder pieces were dominant.  Fixed siege mortars were given the power and range of WW1 artillery batteries.  Grenadiers had beards at a time when facial hair, especially in 18th century western European armies, was prohibited.  Native American tribes were able to field armies of thousands upon thousands of warriors.  Drummers on the march beat their drums like a hummingbird flapping it's wings, when in fact they were there to set a much slower beat for troops to march to.  Rifle units, with their deadly accuracy, loaded as fast as musket units, had swords (even the American riflemen wearing hunting frocks) and unreasonable hand to hand fighting skills v. other infantry.  While many of these issues were thankfully fixed in Napoleon: Total War, it pretty much put a damper on the gameplay in Empire.
CA eventually corrected many of Empire's early glitches and bugs and expanded the game with DL content, such as the War of Independence units, which, despite the blatant uniform flaws (like the Royal Welch Fusiliers uniform, which was totally wrong), was a great addition to the multiplayer.  In the end, was Empire a good game?  Most definitely yes.  Once you got past the little quirks, many of which would only be noticed by those knowledgeable in the period, there were plenty of times ETW was extremely impressive with its scope and downright beautiful graphics.  Empire turned out to be not just mindless strategy and conquest - this game expanded the historical knowledge of anyone who played it.  For example, how many who played ETW knew beforehand that the British used light infantry tactics extensively in the American War of Independence?  I look forward to when CA returns to this time period in the years ahead to make ETW 2.  I just hope CA would contact more historians and historical reenactment groups in the future, since these individuals and groups would gladly help out CA to make sure the period was accurately portrayed!",1389487540,1389487540,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561197997051707,37,1,40244,0,39492.0,1568515037

This title, like all of Creative Assembly's Total War titles, has HUGE replay value. Now that being said, I feel that with this game, CA has gone forward, yet at the same time gone backward in some respects. There were things that they could have done, could have added, that would have made this game perfect in my book. 

The pros:  Expanded map. Their biggest one yet. This map includes the Americas and South Asia (Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan, India), which is a huge plus for me. The bigger the map the better. I really enjoyed the fact that there are mini-towns littered around region capitals. It adds a new dynamic of urgency and believability to the campaign. I also love how there are a ton of factions littering the map. The new technology feature is great, as is the addition of surprise emergent factions. The new battle mechanics that involve new firearms and artillery is excellent, as are the new naval battles. Whats not to love about that? Also, I love the revolution feature and how the dynamics of political change can screw diplomatic relations up. Top notch stuff. One great feature is the ease of hiring generals. This time around I did not have to wait for the AI to spawn one for me.

The cons:  I would have loved to play every faction, such as the Mughals, the minor powers like Venice and Persia, and even emergent ones like Punjab and Mexico. I felt a bit teased to be honest, but the problem is fixable by a mod (Empire: Total Factions). I also felt that the characters traits had decreased from what was seen in Rome and Medieval 2. Speaking of characters, generals and admirals can be recruited as easily as any infantry unit, but why not rakes and priests? I understand the rationale about not being able to purchase new gentlemen (because of the technology rates and all), but at least let me buy rakes to spread havoc around!

We've sampled 1 million Empire: Total War players and can reveal that playtime is through the roof!

The stats are in and they look like this:

The average amount of time gamers played Empire: Total War for was a whopping 92 hours - and an incredible 26% of people played Empire for more than 100 hours. 

That's way above the average of most Steam games, and shows our fans really care about putting in the hours on their campaigns as they strive for global domination. We wouldn't want it any other way. Just one more turn!

95,8481678,english,"This is the best TW game to date, IMO. And that includes Shogun II and Rome II. There is a negative opinion of this game, but much of that is from when the game was first released and nearly unplayable. Now years and many patches later, the game is easily the deepest and most expansive TW game yet. The colony/economy/trade system is miles deeper than anything in Shogun II or Rome II, and the map is the most expansive TW map ever (Europe (including Russia to the Urals), North Africa, Middle East, North America to the Rockies, Central America, Northern half of South America, India, the entire Caribbean, and a bunch of trade zones in Africa and the Pacific.).

The combat is also much more varied and interesting than Shogun II/Rome II. The move to primarily gunpowder based infantry and artillery really changes up the traditional TW combat formula that goes all the way back to Shogun. Although most armies will always have line infantry as a foundation, I found the myriad number of supporting units to be extremely varied and interesting to use, really adding depth to the tactics. Whether experimenting with the tons of different cavalry and dragoons, light infantry, melee infantry, grenadiers, etc... or mixing and matching all the different types of artillery units, the tactical side of Empire is much more interesting than any other TW game on the market.

My only negative is the ship combat, which is a true simulation, but frankly not that fun. That said, there are people who love the naval battles who would disagree with me.",1388588196,1388588196,True,0,0,0.443483740091323853,0,True,False,False,76561198006684268,215,35,23395,0,20268.0,1473550576

It's a good system, smooth flowing and surprisingly good detail in graphics for having so many soldiers on screen at one time. It's focused on the late 1700s around the colonization of the Americas. It allows you to play as multiple factions in a type of free play. It's not an overwhelming story depth but for RTS games they are more for replay ability in my opinion. I've done several world domination games and it never gets old. Play as Britain, France, Spain, Sweden or somewhere else. You choose.

 My only complaint in games like world domination where your goal is to take over the world (obvious right?) you can't play as small factions like the American Colonies. Personally I would like to train them and slowly build them to take over the world but it's not an option.

Empire: Total War was going to be the most ambitious project taken on by the Creative Assembly, but instead it ended up as possibly their biggest fiasco. Not only was the AI a horribly broken mess that would ram tiny armies into your massive ones and chase after your tiny armies with doomstacks, but the performance, even today, on high end rigs was disastrous.

It suffered, and still suffers to this day, from a glitch that caused the turns to get exponentially longer due to the AI constructing more and more individual armies and sending them out on the map in completely illogical and irrational patterns. CA promised to fix it, but appears to have abandoned the game entirely.

i like how they used more of range attacks though they could and in more melee death animations becuz sometimes when a person dies, they go into a animation for when they are shot. though, the game is really impressive with its large northern hemisphere map and its large scale battle.

i think the AI could still use more tweaking becuz they sometimes seem suicidal. 

in conclusion, this is a great game for 20 dollars but if u are looking to spend more on a more refined game get Shogun 2.

I also love the audio for this game.  I would find myself scrolling up to a single unit and just listening to how well in sounded when he shot his musket.
